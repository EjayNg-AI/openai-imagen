Here are \r\nsome examples:\r\nsThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\nseat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\nsAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\nan average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\nteens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\nunsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\nsA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\nof catching a cold.4\r\nsFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\nthat listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\nCan we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\ndepends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\nlook at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\nEach year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\nvehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\npeople in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\nof an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\nasking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\nconducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\nabout some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\nIn the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\nquestions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\nthem a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\nobservational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\ndrawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\nwhile listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\nlist of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\nThe goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\nchanges in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\nthe ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\nHere\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\nACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\nMATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\nclock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\nConfucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.\u201d \r\nDo people really remember what they see better than what they hear?6 In this \r\nActivity, you will perform an experiment to try to find out.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 2 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://97092a2aa30f9ab#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_1.jpg","size_bytes":62783,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>","Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 207\r\nSampling and Surveys\r\nSuppose we want to find out what percent of young drivers in the United States \r\ntext while driving. To answer the question, we will interview 16- to 20-year-olds \r\nwho live in the United States and drive. Ideally, we would ask them all (take a \r\ncensus). But contacting every driver in this age group wouldn\u2019t be practical: it \r\nwould take too much time and cost too much money. Instead, we put the question \r\nto a sample chosen to represent the entire population of young drivers.\r\n4.1\r\nIn Section 4.1, \r\nyou\u2019ll learn about: \r\nsThe idea of a sample \r\nsurvey\r\nsHow to sample badly\r\nsHow to sample well: \r\nRandom sampling\r\nsOther sampling methods\r\nsInference for sampling\r\nsSample surveys: What \r\ncan go wrong?\r\n1. Divide the class into pairs of students by drawing names from a hat.\r\n2. Your teacher will give each pair two index cards with 10 sets of numbers \r\non them. Do not look at the numbers until it is time for you to do the \r\nexperiment.\r\n3. Flip a coin to decide which of you is Student A and which is Student B. \r\nShuffle the index cards and deal one face down to each partner.\r\n4. Student A will attempt a memory task while Student B keeps time.\r\nDirections: Study the pairs of numbers on the index card for 30 seconds. Then \r\nturn the card over. Recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.). Then tell your part\ufffener (Student B) what you think the numbers on the card are. Student B will \r\nrecord how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n5. Now it\u2019s Student B\u2019s turn to do a memory task while Student A records the data.\r\nDirections: Your partner will read the pairs of numbers on your index card aloud \r\nthree times slowly. Next, you will recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.) and \r\nthen tell your partner what you think the numbers on the card are. Student A will \r\nrecord how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n6. Your teacher will scale and label axes on the board for parallel dotplots of the re\ufffesults. Plot the number of pairs you remembered correctly on the appropriate graph.\r\n7. Did students in your class remember numbers better when they saw them or \r\nwhen they heard them? Give appropriate evidence to support your answer.\r\n8. Based on the results of this experiment, can we conclude that people in gen\ufffeeral remember better when they see than when they hear? Why or why not?\r\nDEFINITION: Population and sample\r\nThe population in a statistical study is the entire group of individuals about which we \r\nwant information.\r\nA sample is the part of the population from which we actually collect information. We \r\nuse information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\nThe distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\nsense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\nHere\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\nuses of sampling.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\nEXAMPLE\r\nEXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\nPopulations and samples\r\nPROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n(a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\nbefore shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\nfive pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\nmoisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n(b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n(a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\nthat are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n(b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\nFor Practice Try Exercise 1\r\nThe Idea of a Sample Survey\r\nWe often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\nbasis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\nand ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\ncream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\nwhole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\nvaried population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\nThe first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\nwhat population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\nexactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\nWe reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\nexample. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\nor \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\nor more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example. We\u2019ll avoid this more \r\nrestrictive terminology.\r\nSample survey\r\nHow Does the Current Population Survey Work?\r\nA sample survey\r\nOne of the most important government sample surveys in the United States is \r\nthe monthly Current Population Survey (CPS).

Let\u2019s take a closer look at some good and not-so-good sam\ufffepling methods.\r\nHow to Sample Badly\r\nHow can we choose a sample that we can trust to represent the population? \r\nThe easiest\u2014but not the best\u2014sampling method just chooses individuals who \r\nare close by. Suppose we\u2019re interested in finding out how long students at a \r\nlarge high school spent on homework last week, for example. We might go to \r\nthe school library and ask the first 30 students we see about their homework \r\ntime. A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\neasiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\nproduce unrepresentative data.\r\nother economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\nspecify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\nall U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\nnot in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\nnews refers to this specific population.\r\nWhat does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\nfor example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\nshe is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\nfirst asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\nwork in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\nyou are not in the labor force.\r\nIf you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\nyou did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\nyou are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\npay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\nbecause of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason.

So are voluntary \r\nresponse samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\nto an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\nresponse samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\nnot representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\nattract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\ndirection. That leads to bias.\r\nDEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\nA voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\nstrong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\nWrite-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\nonly about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\nto be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\nIllegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\nOnline polls\r\nFormer CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\nof his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\nto illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\nloudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\na presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\nresult: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\nPROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\ncould lead to bias in the poll results.\r\nSOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\nThose who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\nhis views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\npopulation who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\nAP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\nthe direction of the bias. Suppose you were asked, \u201cExplain how using a convenience sample of students in \r\nyour statistics class to estimate the proportion of all high school students who own a graphing calculator could \r\nresult in bias.\u201d You might respond, \u201cThis sample would probably include a much higher proportion of students \r\nwith a graphing calculator than in the population at large because a graphing calculator is required for the \r\nstatistics class. That is, this method would probably lead to an overestimate of the actual population proportion.\u201d\r\nwww\r\nFor Practice Try Exercise 5","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6ad2f94da5ad6a1#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_5.jpg","size_bytes":57756,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>","Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 211\r\nCHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\nFor each of the following situations, identify the sampling method used. Then explain \r\nhow the sampling method could lead to bias.\r\n1. A farmer brings a juice company several crates of oranges each week. A company inspector \r\nlooks at 10 oranges from the top of each crate before deciding whether to buy all the oranges.\r\n2.

More than 186,000 callers responded, and 67% said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\nHow to Sample Well: \r\nRandom Sampling\r\nIn a voluntary response sample, people choose whether to respond. In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\nproduces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\nthe sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\nand self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\na sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\nThe simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n(the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\nrandom sample.\r\nDEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\nA simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\nchosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\nsample actually selected.\r\nAn SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\nalso gives every possible sample an equal \r\nchance to be chosen. There are other \r\nrandom sampling methods that give \r\neach individual, but not each sample, an \r\nequal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\nsuch method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\nhow to actually select an SRS.\r\nWhen you think of an SRS, picture \r\ndrawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\npopulation. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\nmethod of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\nwriting names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\nif the population is large.

If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\nrandom digits.\r\nDEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\nA table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\nthese properties:\r\ns Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\ns The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\ngives no information about any other part.\r\nTable D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\ndigits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\nin groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\nthe table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\nthe table to choose a simple random sample.\r\nHow to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\nSTEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\nsame length.\r\nSTEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\nfrom Table D.\r\nYour sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\nAlways use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\nyou can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\nstandard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\nneeded). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\nchance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\nto be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\nlikely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\ndigits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\nYou can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\nand so on\u2014because the table has no order. We recommend reading across rows \r\nfrom left to right.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://fed072027c0760d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_7.jpg","size_bytes":43027,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 75>","Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 213\r\nSpring Break!\r\nChoosing an SRS with Table D\r\nThe school newspaper is planning an article on family-friendly \r\nplaces to stay over spring break at a nearby beach town.

Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\ncase, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\nobtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\nalso be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\nselected.

Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\nworks best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\nin a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\nbetween strata.\r\nDEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\nTo select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\nindividuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\nthese SRSs to form the full sample.\r\nChoose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\nin a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\nhigh school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\nurban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\nthan the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size.

How did the three sampling methods do?\r\nThe following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\nin the music business.\r\nWho Wrote That Song?\r\nUsing a stratified random sample\r\nA radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\nThe organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\nmembers by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\nASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\nyear. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\nprograms across the country each year.\r\nRadio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\nlocation (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\nASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\nare made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\ntapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\nwritten, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\nAlthough a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\nwhen populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\nprefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\nThat\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\nDEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\nTo take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups.

Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\nuse randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\nrandInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\nsurvey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n(c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\nauditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\nlevels, so each should represent the population well.

Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\nthe 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\nof the others.\r\nStage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\nStratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\nStage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\nunits. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\nAnalyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\nbeyond basic statistics. But the SRS is the building block of more elaborate \r\nmethods, and the principles of analysis remain much the same for these other \r\nmethods.\r\nCHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\nThe manager of a sports arena wants to learn more about the financial status of the people \r\nwho are attending an NBA basketball game.

The \r\nprocess of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\ncalled inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\nwe know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\nresponse samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\nthe population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\nselecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\nStill, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\nthe entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\nthe monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\npopulation. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\nalmost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\nInference\r\nACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\nMATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\nother container that students can\u2019t see through\r\nIn this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\nin relation to the population truth.\r\n1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\nparticular color.\r\n2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\nrecord the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\nreturned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\nis the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\ncenter? Is there a clear shape?\r\nWhy can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\nresults of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\nBecause we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\ngovern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\nresults are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\nrandom sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\nthe population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\nsets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\nfor sampling later.\r\nOne point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples. For instance, in the Activity, \r\nyou would get a better estimate of the proportion of red chips in the popula\ufffeMargin of error","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 16 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://136106c58c36cbc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_15.jpg","size_bytes":54135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>","Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 221\r\ntion using random samples of 40 chips than 20 chips. By taking a very large \r\nsample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\nabout the population.\r\nThe Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\nexpect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\nof the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\nsamples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\ntells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\nclicked a response.\r\nSample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\nRandom sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\nThis \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\nmost poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\nknow we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\nbut not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\nmore complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\na textbook exercise.\r\nMost sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\nGood sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\nLet\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\nand nonsampling errors.\r\nSampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\nexpect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\ntell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\ncould lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\ncan avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\noften begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\nlist is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\nindividual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\nDEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\nUndercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\nof choosing the sample.\r\nA sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\nby calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\nphones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\nsurveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\ndiffer systematically from the rest of the population.\r\nSampling frame","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\nEXAMPLE\r\nSampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\nproblems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\nNonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\nOne of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\noccurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\nNonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\nseveral callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\nfinal sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\nwho refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\nmay be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\na poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\npopulation\u2019s views.\r\nDEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\nNonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\nrefuses to participate.\r\nSome students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\ntake part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\nit this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\nvoluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\nbe any nonresponse.\r\nThe ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\nHow bad is nonresponse?\r\nThe Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\nrefuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\nother causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\nreplaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\nBureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\nthe mail questionnaire.\r\nThe University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\nimportant social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\nin person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\nsurvey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\nFIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\nOpinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\nWhat about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\ndon\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\nsign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\nsurvey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\nbusy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\nin just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\ncould not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\na nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\nAnother type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\nresponse. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\nto response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\nexample, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\nthat they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\nquestions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism.

The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\nDoes the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n\u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n\u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\nThere is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\nin this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\nof the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\nwho say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\na question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\nCHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n1. Each of the following is a source of error in a sample survey. Label each as sampling\r\nerror or nonsampling error, and explain your answers.\r\n(a) The telephone directory is used as a sampling frame.\r\n(b) The person cannot be contacted in five calls.\r\n(c) Interviewers choose people walking by on the sidewalk to interview.\r\n2.

We base conclusions about the \r\npopulation on data from the sample. It is important to specify exactly what \r\npopulation you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\ns Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\ns The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\nAn SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\nchosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\nusing random digits to select the sample.

Sleepless nights How much sleep do high school \r\nstudents get on a typical school night? An interested \r\nstudent designed a survey to find out. To make data \r\ncollection easier, the student surveyed the first 100 \r\nstudents to arrive at school on a particular morning. \r\nThese students reported an average of 7.2 hours of \r\nsleep on the previous night.\r\n(a) What type of sample did the student obtain?\r\n(b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n7.2 hours probably higher or lower than the true aver\ufffeage amount of sleep last night for all students at the \r\nschool? Why?\r\n10.

Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\nstratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\nrecords of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\nstratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\nand often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\nOne company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\nthese, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\namounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000.

A hotel has 30 floors with 40 \r\nrooms per floor. The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\nface the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\ngolf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\nwith a water view.

A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen.

High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\nexpensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\nif they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\nor rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\nwork will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\nsurvey to determine the proportion of households in \r\na rural subdivision that would buy the service.

Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\nuse a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\nof apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\na block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\nis a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\nsample.\r\nSuppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\nas four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\naddresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\ncontains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\nplaces down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\nexample, then the systematic random sample consists \r\nof the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\npg 218","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n(a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\nsample of 5 addresses from a list of 200.

Baseball tickets Suppose you want to know the \r\naverage amount of money spent by the fans attending \r\nopening day for the Cleveland Indians baseball sea\ufffeson. You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\nto conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\nallow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\nseats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\nyou randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\nstadium.

Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\nsampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\nthe United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\nestimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n(a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n(b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\nsurvey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\nin telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\ncall is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\nThe Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\nnonresponse to a government survey of households \r\nin Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\nJuly 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\nand 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\nperiod versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\nperiod.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\nrate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\nnonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\nanswer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\ndrove through, how many of them were red when you \r\nentered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\npractical problem with this survey is that people may \r\nnot give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\nof the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\nbelt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\nchosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\nthey were invited to answer questions that included \r\nquestions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\nalways used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\nseat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\nlots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey. Do you expect bias in the same \r\ndirection in most surveys about seat belt use?\r\n35. Wording bias Comment on each of the following \r\nas a potential sample survey question.

Sample surveys are one kind of observational\r\nstudy. Other observational studies watch the behavior of animals in the wild or the \r\ninteractions between teacher and students in the classroom. This section is about \r\nstatistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\nObservational Study versus Experiment\r\nIn contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\nask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\nresponse. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\nof a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\nDEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\nAn observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\ndoes not attempt to influence the responses.\r\nAn experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\nresponses.\r\nThe goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\nto compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\nof an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\nresponse. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\nway to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\nsee the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\nis to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\ndata. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\nis one of the most important in statistics.\r\nDoes Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\nafter Menopause?\r\nObservation versus experiment\r\nShould women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\nproduction of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\na heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\nsmall compared with the benefits.\r\nThe evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\nhormones with others who were not.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\nto do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\nlook and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\ntoss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\nseveral experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\nafter reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\nhormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\nFor each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\nhormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\nResearchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\nattack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\nhormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\nthem. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\nrelationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\nDEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\nA lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\nin a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\nLet\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\nreplacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\ntake hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\nhormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\nthey got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\nA situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\ncannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\nWhat about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\nyounger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\nthose who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\nThere was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\nobservational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\nexplanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\nDEFINITION: Confounding\r\nConfounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\non a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\nObservational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\nbecause of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\nlurking variables.

That way, women who took \r\nbetter care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\nolder women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\nin heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\nresults of the earlier observational studies.

Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\nstarted to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\nTo change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\nthe topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\nTo test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\nthe schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\nstandard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\ncurriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\nyears, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\nscores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\nhigh school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\ngreater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\nPROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\nin the CareerStart experiment.\r\nSOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\nvariable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\ncompares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\nbehavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\nThe previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\ntrying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\nall 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\nof schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\nresearchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\nsystematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\nstudents from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\nprogram made the difference.\r\nSometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\nexperiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\ntreatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\nthe factors.

All subjects viewed a 40-minute television program \r\nthat included ads for a digital camera. Some subjects saw a 30-second \r\ncommercial; others, a 90-second version. The same commercial was \r\nshown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After viewing, all the \r\nsubjects answered questions about their recall of the ad, their attitude \r\ntoward the camera, and their intention to purchase it.21\r\nPROBLEM: For the advertising study,\r\n(a) identify the explanatory and response variables, and\r\n(b) list all the treatments.\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n(a) This experiment has 2 explanatory variables (factors): \r\nlength of the commercial and number of repetitions.

The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\nnot be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\ncommercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\ninterest.

Put all the slips in a hat and mix them thoroughly. Draw them out one \r\nat a time until you have 25 slips. These 25 students will take the online course. The \r\nremaining 25 students will take the classroom course. Alternatively, you could write \r\n\u201conline\u201d on 25 of the slips and \u201cclassroom\u201d on the other 25 slips.

It does \r\nspecify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\nDoes using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\ncompletely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\ncourse experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\nand toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\ntails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\nAs long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\nOf course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\neach due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\nThe problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\nthen place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\nto one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\nsame group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\nstudents came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\nwho volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\nthan it really is.\r\nCompletely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments.

You might be thinking that the change \r\nin electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\nwould tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\nSuppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\nhouseholds might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\nwhether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\nconfounding?!)\r\nMany experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\ngroup that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\nan active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\ndeveloped drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\nwork. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\ncontrol group.\r\nSome experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group.

For \r\ninstance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\nof paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\nCHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\nMusic students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately. Can small-group \r\ndiscussions help? The subjects were 29 students preparing for the end-of-semester per\ufffeformance that is an important part of their grade. Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\nvideotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\ndiscuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\ncontrol group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\ndiscussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment. Follow the model of \r\nFigure 4.4.\r\n2. Describe how you would carry out the random assignment. Provide enough detail that \r\na classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\nThree Principles of \r\nExperimental Design\r\nRandomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\ndifferences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\nThe logic is as follows:\r\nsA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\neffects of lurking variables.\r\nsRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\nwe can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\nassignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\nrespects before the treatments are applied.\r\n?\r\nTHINK\r\nABOUT\r\nIT","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\nEXAMPLE\r\nsTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\nany differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\nplay of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\nThe first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\nand random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\nthought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\nmust be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\nThere would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\nbecause of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\nbetween the groups.\r\nWe would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\nexample. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\nreceived the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\nthe effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\naverage responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\nto distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\nSummary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\nThe basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\ngroups is the treatment administered.\r\n2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\nunits to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\ncontrolled on the treatment groups.\r\n3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\ndifferences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\nchance differences between the groups.\r\nLet\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\nexperiment.\r\nThe Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\nA well-designed experiment\r\nDoes regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks? The Phy\ufffesicians\u2019 Health Study was a medical experiment that helped answer this ques\ufffetion. In fact, the Physicians\u2019 Health Study looked at the effects of two drugs: \r\naspirin and beta-carotene. Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\nhelp prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\nmale physicians. There were two explanatory variables (factors), each having \r\ntwo levels: aspirin (yes or no) and beta-carotene (yes or no).

One\ufffefourth of the subjects were assigned at random to each of these treatments.\r\nOn odd-numbered days, the subjects took either a tablet that contained as\ufffepirin or a dummy pill that looked and tasted like the aspirin but had no \r\nactive ingredient (a placebo). On even-numbered days, they took either a \r\ncapsule containing beta-carotene or a placebo. There were several response \r\nvariables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\nother medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\nonly 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\nlarge enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\nattacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\npreventing cancer.\r\nPROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\ndesign was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\nSOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\nlurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\ntreatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\nschedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\nwhich subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\nhelped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\nbegin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\nreplication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\nthe groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\nthe random assignment.\r\nThe control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n(placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\nExperiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\nThe logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\nall the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\nthat all subjects really are treated identically.\r\nIf some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\ngroup takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\nthe subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\nexperiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\nOn even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo.

Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\nthat 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\nheads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\nactive medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\nthe pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\nsignificantly less pain.24\r\nWhen the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\nthat about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\nplacebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\ntreatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\nenthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\nplace to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\nThe strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\ntheir hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\nbeats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\ncourse, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\nBecause the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\nmedical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\nthat they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\nexperiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\nother medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\nsubject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug.

Until the experiment ends and the \r\nresults are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\nis receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\nmanner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\nloss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\nexercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\ntreatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\nthe response variable do know.\r\nSingle-blind\r\nDEFINITION: Double-blind\r\nIn a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\nand measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\nCHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\nIn an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\nweight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\ntwo groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\nWhen the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\nreceived the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\nexperiment.\r\nInference for Experiments\r\nIn an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\nlarge that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\nlaws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\nIf they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\nDEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\nAn observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\nsignificant.\r\nIf we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\ncaused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\npublished research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\ncause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\nknow that in general a strong association does not imply causation. A statistically sig\ufffenificant association in data from a well-designed experiment does imply causation.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b86211c359fd2c0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_39.jpg","size_bytes":53857,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 41 / 75>","Section 4.2 Experiments 245\r\nACTIVITY Distracted driving\r\nMATERIALS: Deck of cards for each team of 3 to 4 students\r\nIs talking on a cell phone while driving more distracting than talking to \r\na passenger?

The researchers randomly assigned half \r\nof the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\nthe other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger.

Let\u2019s return \r\nto the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\none group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\nif it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\nforgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\nYou might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\na lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\nresponse variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\nassigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\nexperiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\ndifferences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\nresponse to the treatments.\r\nBlocking\r\nCompletely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\nreplication.

When a population consists of groups of \r\nindividuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\nsample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

How \r\nshould researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water?

This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\nand women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n(b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\ngroups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\nrandom order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\nthe next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\ngroups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\nFor Practice Try Exercise 79\r\nACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\nMATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\nAre standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates? In this Activity, \r\nyou will perform two experiments to try to answer this question.\r\n1. Completely randomized design For the first experiment, you\u2019ll randomly \r\nassign half of the students in your class to stand and the other half to sit. You can \r\nuse the hat method, Table D, or technology to carry out the random assignment. \r\nOnce the two treatment groups have been formed, students should stand or sit \r\nas required. Then they should measure their pulses for one minute. Have the \r\nsubjects in each group record their data on the board.\r\n2. Matched pairs design In a matched pairs design, each student should receive \r\nboth treatments in a random order. Since you already sat or stood in Step 1, \r\nyou just need to do the opposite now. As before, everyone should measure their \r\npulses for one minute after completing the treatment (that is, once they are \r\nstanding or sitting). Have all the subjects record their data (both measurements) \r\nin a chart on the board.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 45 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d19bf42557d3861#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_44.jpg","size_bytes":57481,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>","250 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n3.

Analyze the data for the matched pairs design.

Make a dotplot of these differences and cal\ufffeculate their mean. Is there evidence that standing pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n5. What advantage does the matched pairs design have over the completely \r\nrandomized design?\r\nAn AP Statistics class with 24 students performed the \u201cGet Your Heart Beating\u201d \r\nActivity. We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\nEXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\nDesign determines analysis\r\nA Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\nrandomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\nstanding group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\nhigher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\npulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\ngraph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\nstanding pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\nWhat about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\nFathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\nrates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\ndifference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\nstanding pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\nevidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\nLet\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\nthat we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\nexperimental designs. Blocking by subject in the matched pairs design greatly \r\nreduced the variability in the response variable. That made it easier to detect \r\nthe fact that standing causes an increase in pulse rate. With the large amount \r\nof variability in the completely randomized design, we were unable to draw \r\nsuch a conclusion.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5c9678406de9a79#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_45.jpg","size_bytes":52515,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 47 / 75>","Section 4.2 Experiments 251\r\nAnother important lesson to take away from the example is this: the design of the \r\nstudy determines the appropriate method of analysis. For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\ndotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\ncompare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\nThe following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\nanalyzing data from an experiment.\r\nDATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\nMost automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n78% nitrogen.

An observational study gathers data on individuals \r\nas they are. Experiments actively do something to people, animals, or \r\nobjects in order to measure their response.\r\ns Statistical studies often try to show that changing one variable (the \r\nexplanatory variable) causes changes in another variable (the response\r\nvariable). Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\nbe distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\nexperiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\nactually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\nvariable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\ns In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\nis a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\ns The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\nmanner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\nprinciples of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\nassignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\ns The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\ntwo or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\nwith other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\ns Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\nRandom assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\nchance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\ncomparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\ns Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\nreduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\nlikely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\ns Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\nneither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\nresponses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\nthe other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\ns Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\nThat helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\npatients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\nthey have received an inactive treatment.\r\ns In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\nindividuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\nRandomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\nhelps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\ns Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\ntreatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\ntreatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\nclosely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\nSummary SECTION 4.2","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n45.

Improving response rate How can we reduce the \r\nrate of refusals in telephone surveys? Most people \r\nwho answer at all listen to the interviewer\u2019s introduc\ufffetory remarks and then decide whether to continue. \r\nOne study made telephone calls to randomly selected \r\nhouseholds to ask opinions about the next election.

Can they persuade students to eat \r\nbetter? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\nintervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\nschool day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\nfor healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\nschool was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention.

Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\nwill use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\nraise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\neither 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\ncombinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\nfabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\nfor quality.\r\n56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\nthe increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\nthey stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\nbeat of a metronome.

The effects of day care Does day care help low\ufffeincome children stay in school and hold good jobs \r\nlater in life? The Carolina Abecedarian Project (the \r\nname suggests the ABCs) has followed a group of \r\n111 children since 1972. Back then, these individu\ufffeals were all healthy but low-income black infants in \r\nChapel Hill, North Carolina.

Researchers in Japan \r\nconducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\nwere extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\neach subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\ntold the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\nsubject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\nwas poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\nthe arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\npoison ivy leaf.39\r\n(a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n(b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\nidea of a placebo effect.\r\n70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\nchronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\nand needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\nwill be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\npercent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n(a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\ndrug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n(b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\ngetting the new drug or a placebo?

The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\nand rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\nwere randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\nmeditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\nsimply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\nthe experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\nand rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\nnow had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\nExplain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\ncould bias the reported results.\r\n72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\ntestosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\ncause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\nfat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\nsupplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\nin the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\nwith low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\na testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\nin the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\ndescribed the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\nplacebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\nterms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\ndetermine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\nacupuncture could help infertile women become \r\npregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\nundergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\nwere recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\nrandomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\nminutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\nwere instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\nembryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n34 women became pregnant.

Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\ncolleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\nHalf of the participants were randomly assigned \r\nto a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\nassigned to a low-fat diet. Researchers measured each \r\nparticipant\u2019s change in weight and cholesterol level \r\nafter six months and again after one year. Subjects in \r\nthe low-carb diet group lost significantly more weight \r\nthan subjects in the low-fat diet group during the first \r\nsix months of the study. At the end of a year, however, \r\nthe average weight loss for subjects in the two groups \r\nwas not significantly different.42\r\n(a) Why did researchers randomly assign the subjects \r\nto the diet treatments?\r\n(b) Explain to someone who knows little statistics \r\nwhat \u201clost significantly more weight\u201d means.\r\n(c) The subjects in the low-carb diet group lost an aver\ufffeage of 5.1 kg in a year.

According to the popular \r\nTV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\nMarch 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\npresented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\nsubjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\nan extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\ncamera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\nseed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\nyawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\nwho had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\ngiven a yawn seed, 10 yawned.

She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\nvariable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\na 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\nrequires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\nsubject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\nmake as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\ncontinuous effort.\r\n(a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\ncompare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\navailable.\r\n(b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\nwide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\nsubjects in each group.

Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\nof carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\nincreasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\nBecause plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\nCO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\nAn elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\nCO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\nthe growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\nuntreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\ngrowth.

Here are two examples.\r\nsThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\nabout 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\nhouseholds to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\nsScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\nsleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\nin performance two days later.48\r\nWhat type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\non the design of the study.\r\nScope of Inference\r\nIn the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\nproduces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\nBureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\nresults of the sample.\r\nIn the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\nsleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\nensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\nthe sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\nchance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\nthat case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\ndecrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\neffect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n4.3\r\nSection 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\nLet\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\nRandom selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\nassignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\nchart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\nWere individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\nYes No\r\nWere individuals \r\nrandomly selected?\r\nYes\r\nInference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\nInference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\nNo Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\nInference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\nWell-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\nHowever, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\nlarger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\neffect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\nrules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\nrandom sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\nexample illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\nEXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\nDetermining scope of inference\r\nA small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\nThe dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\nDesign 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\nto take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\ntake at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\nsores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\nthose who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\nDesign 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\nto take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\nC each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\nDesign 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\npart in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\nDesign 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\npart in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\nday and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\nFor whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\nof patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\nfinds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\nvitamin C having canker sores.\r\nPROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\nSOLUTION:\r\nDesign 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\nholds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments ","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a9a2c4c5c24a51b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_57.jpg","size_bytes":59616,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>","Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\nEXAMPLE\r\nwere deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\ninference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\nwho took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\nDesign 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\npopulation of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\nAssuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\nchance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\nDesign 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\ntown, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\nobservational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\nthat for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\nsores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\nconfounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\nthe general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\nwas only of dental patients.)\r\nDesign 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\nstudy to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\nallow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\nthe chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\npatients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\ndon\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\nthe town.\r\nThe Challenges of \r\nEstablishing Causation\r\nA well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\nchanges in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\nfor specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\nThe serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\nexperiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\nconclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\nDo Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\nLack of realism\r\nDo those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\nsince 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\nshowed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\nBut requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\nWhat happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\nall cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\nFor Practice Try Exercise 105","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\nEXAMPLE\r\nIn some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\nthese important questions:\r\nsDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\nsDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\nsDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\nTo answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\ncomparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\nwhile driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\nabout these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\nstudies.\r\nIt is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\nexperiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\nnonexperimental evidence can be.\r\nDoes Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\nLiving with observational studies\r\nDoctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\nComparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\nbe due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\nboth more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\nso, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\nsmoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\nblame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\nalcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\nWhat are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\nexperiment?\r\nsThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\nvery strong.\r\nsThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\ncountries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\nvariable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\nsLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\nPeople who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\nget lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\nsThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\nof smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\nmore common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\nany other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\nbegan to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\nlag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\ncancer death among women.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\nsThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\ncigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\nMedical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\nThe U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\ncause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\noverwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\nexperiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\nto smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\nobservational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\nData Ethics*\r\nMedical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\nShouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\nreasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\nsA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\nBefore giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\ndrug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\nsAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\nTo find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\napplicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\nsend the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\nnumber of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\nsIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\nrandomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\npill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\nknows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\nthe physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\nsWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\nbehavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\nThe most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\nThe ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\non people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\nmedical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\nare some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\ndata from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\nBasic Data Ethics\r\nAll planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\nboard charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\nAll individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\nbefore data are collected.\r\nAll individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\ngroups of subjects may be made public.\r\n*This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\nThe law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\nobey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\nInstitutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\nto decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\nit is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\nboard, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\nrecruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\nstudy and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\nare informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\nresearch begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\nThe Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\nboards.\r\nInformed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\nand both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\nnature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\nin emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\nsurvey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\ntake. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\npurpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\nmust then consent in writing.\r\nConfidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\nonce a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\nobtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\ncollected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\npercent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\nabout this or any other issue.\r\nConfidentiality is not the same as anonymity. Anonym\ufffeity means that individuals are anonymous\u2014their names ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 63 / 75>","Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 267\r\nare not known even to the director of the study. Anonymity is rare in statistical stud\ufffeies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it \r\nprevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform individuals of results.\r\nAny breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\nonce. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\ninformation, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\nother identification have been removed from the data available for search. Privacy \r\nand confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the computer age.\r\nACTIVITY Response bias\r\nIn this Activity, your team will design and conduct an experiment to investigate \r\nthe effects of response bias in surveys.53 You may choose the topic for your sur\ufffeveys, but you must design your experiment so that it can answer at least one of the \r\nfollowing questions:\r\nsCan the wording of a question create response bias?\r\nsDo the characteristics of the interviewer create response bias?\r\nsDoes anonymity change the responses to sensitive questions?\r\nsDoes manipulating the answer choices change the response?\r\n1.

A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\nto experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\ns Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\nresults.\r\ns In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\na strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\nexplanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\nlurking variables.\r\ns Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\nreview board. All participants must give their informed consent before \r\ntaking part. Any information about the individuals in the study must be \r\nkept confidential.\r\ns Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions \r\nthat can\u2019t be answered without them. Also remember that \u201cthe interests of \r\nthe subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\u201d54\r\nSummary SECTION 4.3\r\nMagnets and Pain\r\nLet\u2019s return to the chapter-opening Case Study (page 205). Researchers carried \r\nout an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\nA completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\ndotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\nmagnet).\r\nThe average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\nand 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\nsignificant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\nThe difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\ntoo large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain. But since the subjects were volunteers, we can\u2019t \r\nsafely generalize the findings of this experiment to any larger \r\npopulation.\r\ncase closed","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 65 / 75>","Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 269\r\n102.

To find out, a company that \r\nproduces batteries takes a random sample of 100 AA \r\nbatteries from its warehouse.

The psychologist observes the students \r\nthrough a one-way window and notes the changes in \r\ntheir behavior during an evening of game playing. \r\nCan the psychologist generalize the results of her \r\nstudy to a team of employees that spends months \r\ndeveloping a new product that never works right and \r\nis finally abandoned by their company?

Here is part of the Times\u2019s \r\nstatement on \u201cHow the Poll Was Conducted\u201d:\r\nThe latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based \r\non telephone interviews conducted March 15 \r\nthrough March 18 with 1,067 adults throughout the \r\nUnited States.\u2026 The sample of telephone numbers \r\ncalled was randomly selected by a computer from a \r\nlist of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges \r\nacross the country. The exchanges were chosen to \r\nensure that each region of the country was represent\ufffeed in proportion to its population. In each exchange, \r\nrandom digits were added to form a complete tele\ufffephone number, thus permitting access to listed and \r\nunlisted numbers. In each household, one adult was \r\ndesignated by a random procedure to be the respon\ufffedent for the survey.65\r\nAP Statistics Practice Test 275","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 72 / 75>","(a) Explain why the sampling method used in this survey \r\nwas not a simple random sample.\r\n(b) Why was one adult chosen at random in each house\ufffehold to respond to the survey?\r\n(c) Explain how undercoverage could lead to bias in this \r\nsample survey.\r\nT4.14. Many people start their day with a jolt of caffeine \r\nfrom coffee or a soft drink. Most experts agree that people \r\nwho take in large amounts of caffeine each day may suf\ufffefer from physical withdrawal symptoms if they stop ingest\ufffeing their usual amounts of caffeine. Researchers recruited \r\n11 volunteers who were caffeine dependent and who were \r\nwilling to take part in a caffeine withdrawal experiment. \r\nThe experiment was conducted on two 2-day periods that \r\noccurred one week apart. During one of the 2-day periods, \r\neach subject was given a capsule containing the amount \r\nof caffeine normally ingested by that subject in one day. \r\nDuring the other study period, the subjects were given pla\ufffecebos. The order in which each subject received the two \r\ntypes of capsules was randomized. The subjects\u2019 diets were \r\nrestricted during each of the study periods. At the end of \r\neach 2-day study period, subjects were evaluated using a \r\ntapping task in which they were instructed to press a button \r\n200 times as fast as they could.66\r\n(a) How and why was blocking used in the design of this \r\nexperiment?\r\n(b) Why did researchers randomize the order in which \r\nsubjects received the two treatments?\r\n(c) Could this experiment have been carried out in a \r\ndouble-blind manner?

The owner of a chain of supermarkets notices that \r\nthere is a positive correlation between the sales of beer \r\nand the sales of ice cream over the course of the previous \r\nyear. During seasons when sales of beer were above aver\ufffeage, sales of ice cream also tended to be above average. \r\nLikewise, during seasons when sales of beer were below \r\naverage, sales of ice cream also tended to be below average. \r\nWhich of the following would be a valid conclusion from \r\nthese facts?\r\n(a) Sales records must be in error. There should be no \r\nassociation between beer and ice cream sales.\r\n(b) Evidently, for a significant proportion of customers of \r\nthese supermarkets, drinking beer causes a desire for ice \r\ncream or eating ice cream causes a thirst for beer.\r\n(c) A scatterplot of monthly ice cream sales versus \r\nmonthly beer sales would show that a straight line describes\r\nthe pattern in the plot, but it would have to be a horizontal \r\nline.\r\n(d) There is a clear negative association between beer sales \r\nand ice cream sales.\r\n(e) The positive correlation is most likely a result of the \r\nlurking variable temperature; that is, as temperatures \r\nincrease, so do both beer sales and ice cream sales.\r\nAP1.8.

Not only are there national brands for \r\nmost products, but many stores have their own in-house \r\nbrands.

It opens with a case study on **magnets and pain relief** and uses it as a running example for what \u201cgood design\u201d looks like (randomization, control/placebo, and blinding), and what conclusions are and aren\u2019t justified. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\nThe chapter is organized around three big ideas: \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Sampling & surveys (Section 4.1):** how to choose samples that represent a population; why convenience/voluntary-response samples are biased; and how random sampling supports inference.  \n- **Experiments (Section 4.2):** how experiments differ from observational studies; how confounding/lurking variables undermine causal claims; and how randomized comparative experiments, control groups/placebos, blinding, replication, and blocking help establish cause-and-effect.  \n- **Using studies wisely (Section 4.3):** what you\u2019re allowed to infer (about a population vs about causation) depending on whether you had random sampling and/or random assignment; why \u201crealism\u201d matters; what strong nonexperimental evidence for causation looks like; and core **data ethics** (institutional review, informed consent, confidentiality). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## More detailed description of Section 1 (Sampling and Surveys / Section 4.1)\n\n### 1) Purpose of a sample survey: population vs sample\nSection 4.1 frames sampling as a practical alternative to a census: you define the **population** you care about, then collect data from a **sample** intended to represent it, and use the sample to draw conclusions about the population. The section emphasizes being explicit about (i) the population definition and (ii) the variables being measured. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n### 2) How sampling goes wrong: convenience samples, voluntary response, and bias\nIt highlights two \u201ceasy but dangerous\u201d methods:  \n- **Convenience samples:** selecting whoever is easiest to reach (e.g., surveying students in the library). These often systematically misrepresent the population. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Voluntary response samples:** people self-select into the sample (call-in polls, online polls). These disproportionately attract people with strong opinions (often aligned in one direction), producing large bias. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\nA key skill it pushes: when asked to diagnose bias, you should describe the **direction** (overestimate vs underestimate) and *why* the method pushes it that way. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n### 3) The core fix: random sampling and the Simple Random Sample (SRS)\nThe \u201cstatistician\u2019s remedy\u201d is to use **impersonal chance**. The section defines a **simple random sample (SRS)** as one where *every set of \\(n\\) individuals has an equal chance* to be selected. This is stronger than \u201ceveryone has an equal chance\u201d (important distinction). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\nIt also gives the standard practical workflow for selecting an SRS:  \n1) **Label** each member of the population with equal-length numerical labels.  \n2) Use a **table of random digits** (or a random number generator) to read groups of digits of the needed length, skipping invalid labels and repeats, until you have the required sample size. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n### 4) Beyond SRS: stratified, cluster, and multistage sampling\nBecause true SRS is often impractical at scale, the section introduces common alternatives: \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Stratified random sampling:** split the population into **strata** (groups that are similar internally but differ from each other in ways relevant to the variable), then take an SRS within each stratum and combine. This can improve precision when strata are meaningfully distinct. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Cluster sampling:** split into **clusters** that each \u201clook like the population on a smaller scale,\u201d randomly select clusters, then sample everyone in those clusters. This is often chosen for logistics, not necessarily statistical efficiency. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Multistage sampling:** combining multiple stages (often stratification + clustering) is described using a large government survey as an example design pattern. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\nA recurring point: don\u2019t confuse **strata** (internally similar, between-strata different) with **clusters** (each cluster ideally mirrors the whole population). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n### 5) Inference for sampling: why random samples justify \u201ctrustworthy\u201d estimation\nThe section explains that even with random sampling, **sample-to-sample variability** is inevitable. Random sampling\u2019s advantage is that probability theory lets you quantify typical variation (e.g., via a **margin of error**) and understand how sample size affects precision (larger random samples \u2192 less variability, better estimates). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n### 6) Even good random samples can still go wrong: sampling frame + nonsampling errors\nIt distinguishes two broad error categories beyond pure \u201crandom variability\u201d: \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Sampling errors (in the practical sense):** issues in how the sample is actually drawn, especially problems with the **sampling frame** (the list you sample from). This leads to **undercoverage** when some groups are systematically missing from the frame. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Nonsampling errors:** problems that can occur even in a census, especially **nonresponse** (can\u2019t contact/refusal), **response bias** (systematic misreporting), and the outsized impact of **question wording and question order**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n### 7) Section 4.1 takeaway summary (what you should walk away able to do)\nBy the end of Section 4.1, you\u2019re meant to be able to: define population/sample clearly; identify bad sampling methods and explain the *direction* of likely bias; describe and execute random selection of an SRS (table/technology); choose between stratified vs

The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L6] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L7] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L8] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L9] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L10] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L11] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L12] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L13] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L14] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L15] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L16] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L17] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L18] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L19] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L20] memory. \u201cHave you visited a dentist in the last 6 months?\u201d will often draw a \r\n[L21] \u201cYes\u201d from someone who last visited a dentist 8 months ago.10 Careful training \r\n[L22] of interviewers and careful supervision to avoid variation among the interview\ufffeers can reduce response bias. Good interviewing technique is another aspect of \r\n[L23] a well-done sample survey.\r\n[L24] Response bias<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 19 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 20 / 75>224 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L25] The wording of questions is the most important influence on the answers given \r\n[L26] to a sample survey. Confusing or leading questions can introduce strong bias, and \r\n[L27] changes in wording can greatly change a survey\u2019s outcome. Even the order in \r\n[L28] which questions are asked matters.\r\n[L29] How Do Americans Feel about Illegal Immigrants?\r\n[L30] Question wording matters\r\n[L31] \u201cShould illegal immigrants be prosecuted and deported for being in the U.S. illegally, \r\n[L32] or shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Asked this question in an opinion poll, 69% favored deportation. \r\n[L33] But when the very same sample was asked whether illegal immigrants who have \r\n[L34] worked in the United States for two years \u201cshould be given a chance to keep their jobs \r\n[L35] and eventually apply for legal status,\u201d 62% said that they should. Different questions \r\n[L36] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L37] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L38] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L39] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L40] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L41] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L42] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L43] in this order.

Then explain \r\n[L6] how the sampling method could lead to bias.\r\n[L7] 1. A farmer brings a juice company several crates of oranges each week. A company inspector \r\n[L8] looks at 10 oranges from the top of each crate before deciding whether to buy all the oranges.\r\n[L9] 2. The ABC program Nightline once asked whether the United Nations should continue \r\n[L10] to have its headquarters in the United States. Viewers were invited to call one telephone \r\n[L11] number to respond \u201cYes\u201d and another for \u201cNo.\u201d There was a charge for calling either num\ufffeber. More than 186,000 callers responded, and 67% said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n[L12] How to Sample Well: \r\n[L13] Random Sampling\r\n[L14] In a voluntary response sample, people choose whether to respond. In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L15] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L16] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L17] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L18] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L19] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L20] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L21] random sample.\r\n[L22] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L23] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L24] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L25] sample actually selected.\r\n[L26] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L27] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L28] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L29] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L30] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L31] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L32] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L33] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L34] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L35] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L36] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L37] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L38] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L39] if the population is large. Think about the \r\n[L40] Current Population Survey, for example, \r\n[L41] Random sampling<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 7 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>212 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L42] which must draw a sample of size 60,000 every month from the population of \r\n[L43] over 117 million U.S. households.\r\n[L44] In practice, people use random numbers generated by a computer or calcula\ufffetor to choose samples.

If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L20] random digits.\r\n[L21] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L22] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L23] these properties:\r\n[L24] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L25] s The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\n[L26] gives no information about any other part.\r\n[L27] Table D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\n[L28] digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\n[L29] in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\n[L30] the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\n[L31] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L32] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L33] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L34] same length.\r\n[L35] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L36] from Table D.\r\n[L37] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L38] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L39] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L40] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L41] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L42] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L43] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L44] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L45] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L46] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L47] and so on\u2014because the table has no order.\n# \u30103\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"1:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Asking \r\n[L2] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L3] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L4] 1.

A survey paid for by makers of disposable diapers found that 84% of the sample opposed \r\n[L10] banning disposable diapers. Here is the actual question:\r\n[L11] It is estimated that disposable diapers account for less than 2% of the trash in today\u2019s \r\n[L12] landfills. In contrast, beverage containers, third-class mail and yard wastes are estimated\r\n[L13] to account for about 21% of the trash in landfills. Given this, in your opinion, would it \r\n[L14] be fair to ban disposable diapers?11\r\n[L15] Explain how the wording of the question could result in bias. Be sure to specify the direc\ufffetion of the bias.\r\n[L16] Wording of questions\r\n[L17] ?\r\n[L18] THINK\r\n[L19] ABOUT\r\n[L20] IT\r\n[L21] EXAMPLE<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 20 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>s A sample survey selects a sample from the population of all individuals \r\n[L22] about which we desire information. We base conclusions about the \r\n[L23] population on data from the sample. It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L24] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L25] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L26] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L27] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L28] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L29] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L30] process.\r\n[L31] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L32] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L33] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L34] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L35] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L36] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L37] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L38] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L39] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L40] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L41] prone to large bias.\r\n[L42] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L43] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L44] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L45] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L46] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L47] errors. These have nothing to do with choosing a sample\u2014they are \r\n[L48] present even in a census. The single biggest problem for sample surveys \r\n[L49] is nonresponse: people can\u2019t be contacted or refuse to answer. Incorrect \r\n[L50] answers by respondents can lead to response bias. Finally, the exact \r\n[L51] wording of questions has a big influence on the answers.\r\n[L52] Summary SECTION 4.1\r\n[L53] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 225\r\n[L54] 4.1 TECHNOLOGY CORNER\r\n[L55] Choosing an SRS..................................................................... page 214\r\n[L56] TI-Nspire instructions in Appendix B<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 21 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 75>226 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L57] 1.

You have given every \r\n[L29] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L30] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L31] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L32] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L33] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L34] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L35] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L36] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L37] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L38] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L39] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L40] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L41] method?\r\n[L42] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L43] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L44] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L45] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L46] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L47] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L48] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L49] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L50] sample.\r\n[L51] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L52] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L53] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L54] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L55] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L56] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L57] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L58] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L59] pg 218<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L60] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L61] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200.

So are voluntary \r\n[L17] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L18] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L19] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L20] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L21] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L22] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L23] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L24] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L25] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L26] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L27] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L28] to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\n[L29] Illegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\n[L30] Online polls\r\n[L31] Former CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\n[L32] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L33] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L34] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L35] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L36] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L37] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L38] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L39] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L40] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L41] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L42] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L43] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L44] the direction of the bias.\n# \u30101\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file1\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:1\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L2] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L3] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L4] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L5] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L6] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L7] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L8] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L9] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L10] Sampling frame<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L11] EXAMPLE\r\n[L12] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L13] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L14] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L15] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L16] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L17] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L18] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L19] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L20] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L21] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L22] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L23] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L24] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L25] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L26] refuses to participate.\r\n[L27] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L28] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L29] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L30] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L31] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L32] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L33] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L34] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L35] refuse to respond.

The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L23] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L24] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L25] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L26] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L27] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L28] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L29] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L30] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L31] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L32] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L33] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L34] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L35] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L36] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L37] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L38] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L39] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L40] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L41] memory.\n# \u30103\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Of course, only \r\n[L2] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee.

Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L11] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L12] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L13] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L14] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L15] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L16] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L17] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L18] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L19] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L20] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L21] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L22] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L23] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L24] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L25] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L26] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L27] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L28] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L29] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L30] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L31] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L32] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L33] Sampling frame<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L34] EXAMPLE\r\n[L35] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L36] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L37] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L38] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L39] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L40] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L41] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L42] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L43] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L44] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L45] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L46] population\u2019s views.\n# \u30104\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L2] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L3] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L4] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L5] to be the same people who call radio talk shows.

One \r\n[L9] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L10] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L11] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L12] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L13] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L14] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L15] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L16] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L17] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L18] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L19] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L20] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L21] the direction of the bias.

That is, this method would probably lead to an overestimate of the actual population proportion.\u201d\r\n[L26] www\r\n[L27] For Practice Try Exercise 5<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 6 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 211\r\n[L28] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L29] For each of the following situations, identify the sampling method used.

The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L40] the sample.

Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L2] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L3] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L4] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L5] selected.

Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L9] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L10] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L11] between strata.\r\n[L12] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L13] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L14] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L15] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L16] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L17] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L18] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L19] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L20] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size.

Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L24] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L25] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L26] money she\u2019ll make from selling them. It would take too much time to \r\n[L27] count the plants in all 100 squares, so she\u2019ll accept an estimate based on \r\n[L28] a sample of 10 squares.\r\n[L29] 1.

This time, you\u2019ll take a stratified random sample using the \r\n[L33] rows as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select \r\n[L34] one square from each (horizontal) row. Record the location of \r\n[L35] each square.\r\n[L36] 3. Now, take a stratified random sample using the columns\r\n[L37] as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select one \r\n[L38] square from each (vertical) column. Record the location of \r\n[L39] each square.\r\n[L40] 4. The table on page N/DS-6 gives the actual number of \r\n[L41] sunflowers in each grid square.

Be sure you understand the difference between strata and clusters. \r\n[L18] We want each stratum to contain similar individuals, and for there to be large \r\n[L19] differences between strata.

Make comparative dotplots showing the mean number of sunflowers ob\ufffetained using the three different sampling methods for all members of the class. \r\n[L14] Describe any similarities and differences you see.\r\n[L15] 6. Your teacher will provide you with the mean number of sunflowers in the popu\ufffelation of all 100 grid squares in the field. How did the three sampling methods do?\r\n[L16] The following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\n[L17] in the music business.\r\n[L18] Who Wrote That Song?\r\n[L19] Using a stratified random sample\r\n[L20] A radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\n[L21] The organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\n[L22] members by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\n[L23] ASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\n[L24] year. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L25] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L26] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L27] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L28] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L29] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L30] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L31] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L32] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L33] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L34] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L35] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L36] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L37] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups. Ideally, these \r\n[L38] clusters should mirror the characteristics of the population. Then choose an SRS of the \r\n[L39] clusters. All individuals in the chosen clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L40] Imagine a large high school that assigns its students to homerooms alphabeti\ufffecally by last name. The school administration is considering a new schedule and \r\n[L41] would like student input. Administrators decide to survey 200 randomly selected \r\n[L42] students. It would be hard to track down an SRS of 200 students, so the adminis\ufffetration opts for a cluster sample of homerooms.

Use randInt(1,800) on your \r\n[L103] calculator until 80 different seats are selected. Then give the survey to the students in those seats.<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 14 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 15 / 75>Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 219\r\n[L104] (b) The students in the assembly are seated by grade level. Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L105] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L106] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L107] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L108] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L109] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L110] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L111] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L112] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L113] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L114] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L115] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L116] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L117] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L118] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L119] Sampling Units, or PSUs.\n# \u30104\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"3:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] What would you recommend as the \r\n[L2] strata?

A hotel has 30 floors with 40 \r\n[L7] rooms per floor. The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L8] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L9] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L10] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L11] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L12] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L13] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L14] might be preferable to an SRS in this case. What \r\n[L15] would you use as strata?\r\n[L16] (b) Why might a cluster sample be a simpler option? \r\n[L17] What would you use as clusters?\r\n[L18] 23. Is it an SRS? A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L19] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L20] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L21] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L22] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L23] Explain your answer.\r\n[L24] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L25] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L26] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L27] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L28] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L29] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L30] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L31] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L32] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L33] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L34] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L35] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L36] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L37] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L38] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L39] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L40] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L41] method?\r\n[L42] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L43] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L44] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L45] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L46] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L47] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L48] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L49] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L50] sample.\r\n[L51] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L52] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L53] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L54] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L55] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L56] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L57] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L58] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L59] pg 218<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L60] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L61] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200.

You should always state the **population** precisely and list the **variables** you intend to measure. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file3\ue202L21-L24\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 2) Bias and two common \u201cbad\u201d sampling methods\n- **Bias (definition):** a study design is biased if it *systematically* favors certain outcomes (so it tends to overestimate or underestimate the truth in a consistent direction). \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L14-L15\ue201  \n- **Convenience sample (definition):** selecting individuals who are easiest to reach. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L5-L6\ue201  \n  - Simple example: estimating average study time by sampling only students in a library likely **overestimates** the population average. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L7-L12\ue201  \n- **Voluntary response sample (definition):** people self-select into the sample by responding to a general invitation; it tends to be biased because those with strong opinions are most likely to respond (often in the same direction). \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L16-L25\ue201  \n  - Simple example: a \u201cclick to vote\u201d online poll tends to overrepresent highly motivated viewers rather than the general public. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L16-L25\ue201  \n- Practical diagnostic skill: when asked \u201chow does this design create bias?\u201d, you should **state the direction** (over/under-estimate) and why. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file4\ue202L20-L25\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 3) The central remedy: random sampling and the Simple Random Sample\n- **Random sampling:** using chance to select the sample; the core goal is to remove personal choice and self-selection from the selection mechanism. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file4\ue202L37-L42\ue201  \n- **Simple Random Sample (SRS)** (*simple random sample*) **(definition):** a sample of size \\(n\\) chosen so that **every set of \\(n\\)** individuals in the population is equally likely to be the selected sample. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file1\ue202L22-L25\ue201  \n  - Important nuance emphasized in the text: an SRS equalizes chances not just for individuals, but for **all possible samples** of size \\(n\\). \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file1\ue202L26-L31\ue201\n\n**Useful consequences (\u201cformulae\u201d) of an SRS** (from the definition):\n- If the population size is \\(N\\) and you take an SRS of size \\(n\\), then each individual has the same selection probability  \n  \\[\n  \\Pr(\\text{a given individual is selected})=\\frac{n}{N}.\n  \\]\n- Each particular size-\\(n\\) sample has probability  \n  \\[\n  \\Pr(\\text{a particular sample})=\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{n}}.\n  \\]\n(These follow from \u201cevery set of \\(n\\) individuals is equally likely.\u201d \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file1\ue202L22-L25\ue201)\n\n---\n\n### 4) How to actually choose an SRS (Table of Random Digits / technology)\nWhen the population is large, the text recommends using a random number generator or a **table of random digits**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L19-L20\ue201\n\n- **Table of random digits (definition):** a long list of digits 0\u20139 where each digit is equally likely, and digits behave independently (knowing earlier digits gives no information about later ones). \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L21-L26\ue201  \n- **Procedure to select an SRS using a digit table:**  \n  1) **Label** each population member with same-length numerical labels. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L32-L35\ue201  \n  2) Read consecutive digit groups of the right length from the table; the labels you encounter determine your sample. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L35-L37\ue201  \n  3) Ignore digit groups that aren\u2019t valid labels (outside your numbering scheme) or duplicates already selected. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L44-L46\ue201  \n  - \u201cShortest labels that cover the population\u201d is the guiding rule (e.g., two digits cover up to 100 labels). \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L38-L44\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 5) Beyond SRS: stratified, cluster, multistage, and systematic sampling\nThe section explains that an SRS is often impractical; more complex designs are common. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L1-L6\ue201\n\n#### Stratified random sampling\n- **Stratified random sample and strata (definition):** split the population into **strata** = groups of similar individuals (similar in ways that affect the variable), take a separate SRS within each stratum, then combine the subsamples. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L12-L15\ue201  \n- Key idea: if individuals inside strata are more homogeneous than the whole population, stratification can improve precision for the same total sample size. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L19-L21\ue201  \n- Simple example: stratify a school by grade level, then sample within each grade. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L16-L20\ue201\n\n#### Cluster sampling\n- **Cluster sample and clusters (definition):** divide the population into clusters that (ideally) look like mini-populations; take an SRS of clusters; then include **everyone** in chosen clusters. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file1\ue202L4-L7\ue201  \n- The section stresses the conceptual difference:\n  - **Strata:** internally similar; differences **between** strata are large.  \n  - **Clusters:** each cluster should resemble the whole population on a smaller scale. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file1\ue202L17-L20\ue201  \n- Practical note: cluster sampling is often chosen for logistical convenience and doesn\u2019t automatically improve statistical precision the way stratification can. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file1\ue202L14-L17\ue201\n\n#### Multistage samples\n- Large-scale surveys often use **multistage sampling**, combining two or more methods. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file3\ue202L115-L116\ue201\n\n#### Systematic random sample (often used as a stage)\nThe text describes a common \u201cinterval\u201d method:\n- If you want \\(n\\) items from an ordered list of \\(N\\) and \\(N/n = k\\) is an integer, pick a random start among the first \\(k\\) positions, then take every \\(k\\)-th item thereafter. In the example \\(N=100, n=4\\), \\(k=100/4=25\\). \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file4\ue202L45-L58\ue201  \n  - \u201cFormula\u201d: \\(k=\\frac{N}{n}\\) (the sampling interval) and selected indices are \\(s, s+k, s+2k, \\dots\\). \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file4\ue202L51-L58\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 6) What can go wrong even in \u201crandomly selected\u201d surveys\nEven with random sampling, results vary from sample to sample; this is **sampling variability**, commonly reported via a **margin of error**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue202L6-L9\ue201  \n- The margin of error describes expected variation due to random sampling; increasing sample size can reduce this variability. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue202L17-L18\ue201  \n\nBut many serious problems are **not** captured by margin of error. The section separates:\n\n#### (A) Sampling errors (practical meaning)\n- \u201cSampling errors\u201d here means mistakes in the sampling process that can cause inaccurate information, beyond the natural sample-to-sample variation. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue202L17-L20\ue201  \n- **Sampling frame:** the list you actually sample from; ideally it lists every population member. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue202L22-L24\ue201  \n- **Undercoverage (definition):** some groups in the population are left out of the sampling process (often because the sampling frame misses them). \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue202L25-L27\ue201  \n\n#### (B) Nonsampling errors\nThese can occur even with a perfect sampling plan\u2014or even in a census. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file1\ue202L14-L16\ue201  \n- **Nonresponse (definition):** a selected individual can\u2019t be contacted or refuses to participate. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file1\ue202L24-L26\ue201  \n- **Response bias:** a systematic pattern of incorrect answers (e.g., misreporting socially desirable behaviors, interviewer effects, recall errors). \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue202L14-L21\ue201  \n- **Question wording and order effects:** the exact phrasing is the strongest influence on survey answers; order can matter too. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue202L25-L28\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 7) The section\u2019s \u201cexecutive summary\u201d (what you should be able to state quickly)\n- Define population and variables; use chance-based selection; distinguish **SRS vs stratified vs cluster**; and identify major error sources: **undercoverage, nonresponse, response bias, and wording/order effects**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file3\ue202L21-L51\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":372,"end_ix":401,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf","id":"file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70","source":"my_files","text":"EXAMPLE<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 20 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>s A sample survey selects a sample from the population of all individuals \nabout which we desire information.

Sleepless nights How much sleep do high school \r\n[L26] students get on a typical school night? An interested \r\n[L27] student designed a survey to find out.

Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L3] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L4] clicked a response.\r\n[L5] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L6] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L7] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L8] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L9] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L10] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L11] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L12] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L13] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L14] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L15] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L16] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L17] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L18] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L19] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L20] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L21] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L22] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L23] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L24] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L25] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L26] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L27] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L28] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L29] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L30] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L31] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L32] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L33] Sampling frame<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L34] EXAMPLE\r\n[L35] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L36] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L37] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L38] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L39] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L40] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L41] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L42] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L43] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L44] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight.

Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L28] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L29] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L30] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L31] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L32] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L33] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L34] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L35] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L36] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L37] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L38] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L39] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L40] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L41] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2).

Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L29] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L30] process.\r\n[L31] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L32] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L33] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L34] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L35] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L36] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L37] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L38] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L39] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L40] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L41] prone to large bias.\r\n[L42] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L43] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L44] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L45] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L46] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L47] errors. These have nothing to do with choosing a sample\u2014they are \r\n[L48] present even in a census. The single biggest problem for sample surveys \r\n[L49] is nonresponse: people can\u2019t be contacted or refuse to answer. Incorrect \r\n[L50] answers by respondents can lead to response bias.

Confusing or leading questions can introduce strong bias, and \r\n[L6] changes in wording can greatly change a survey\u2019s outcome. Even the order in \r\n[L7] which questions are asked matters.\r\n[L8] How Do Americans Feel about Illegal Immigrants?\r\n[L9] Question wording matters\r\n[L10] \u201cShould illegal immigrants be prosecuted and deported for being in the U.S. illegally, \r\n[L11] or shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Asked this question in an opinion poll, 69% favored deportation. \r\n[L12] But when the very same sample was asked whether illegal immigrants who have \r\n[L13] worked in the United States for two years \u201cshould be given a chance to keep their jobs \r\n[L14] and eventually apply for legal status,\u201d 62% said that they should. Different questions \r\n[L15] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L16] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L17] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L18] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L19] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L20] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L21] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L22] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L23] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L24] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L25] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L26] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L27] 1.

By the end of the chapter, you\u2019ll be ready to interpret \r\n[L7] the results of this study.\r\n[L8] Early research showed that magnetic fields affected living tissue in humans. Some doc\ufffetors have begun to use magnets to treat patients with chronic pain. Scientists wondered \r\n[L9] whether this type of therapy really worked. They designed a study to find out.\r\n[L10] Fifty patients with chronic pain were recruited for the study. A doctor identified a painful \r\n[L11] site on each patient and asked him or her to rate the pain on a scale from 0 (mild pain) to \r\n[L12] 10 (severe pain). Then, the doctor selected a sealed envelope containing a magnet from a \r\n[L13] box that contained both active and inactive magnets. That way, neither the doctor nor the \r\n[L14] patient knew which type of magnet was being used. The chosen magnet was applied to \r\n[L15] the site of the pain for 45 minutes. After \u201ctreatment,\u201d each patient was again asked to rate \r\n[L16] the level of pain from 0 to 10.\r\n[L17] In all, 29 patients were given active magnets and 21 patients received inactive magnets. \r\n[L18] All but one of the patients rated their initial pain as an 8, 9, or 10.

Here are \r\n[L26] some examples:\r\n[L27] sThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\n[L28] seat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\n[L29] sAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\n[L30] an average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\n[L31] teens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\n[L32] unsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\n[L33] sA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\n[L34] of catching a cold.4\r\n[L35] sFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\n[L36] that listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\n[L37] Can we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\n[L38] depends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\n[L39] look at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\n[L40] Each year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\n[L41] vehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\n[L42] people in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\n[L43] of an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\n[L44] asking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\n[L45] conducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\n[L46] about some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\n[L47] In the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\n[L48] questions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\n[L49] them a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\n[L50] observational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\n[L51] drawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\n[L52] while listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\n[L53] list of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\n[L54] The goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\n[L55] changes in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\n[L56] the ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\n[L57] Here\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\n[L58] ACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\n[L59] MATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\n[L60] clock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\n[L61] Confucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget.

To answer the question, we will interview 16- to 20-year-olds \r\n[L70] who live in the United States and drive. Ideally, we would ask them all (take a \r\n[L71] census). But contacting every driver in this age group wouldn\u2019t be practical: it \r\n[L72] would take too much time and cost too much money. Instead, we put the question \r\n[L73] to a sample chosen to represent the entire population of young drivers.\r\n[L74] 4.1\r\n[L75] In Section 4.1, \r\n[L76] you\u2019ll learn about: \r\n[L77] sThe idea of a sample \r\n[L78] survey\r\n[L79] sHow to sample badly\r\n[L80] sHow to sample well: \r\n[L81] Random sampling\r\n[L82] sOther sampling methods\r\n[L83] sInference for sampling\r\n[L84] sSample surveys: What \r\n[L85] can go wrong?\r\n[L86] 1.

Do not look at the numbers until it is time for you to do the \r\n[L89] experiment.\r\n[L90] 3. Flip a coin to decide which of you is Student A and which is Student B. \r\n[L91] Shuffle the index cards and deal one face down to each partner.\r\n[L92] 4. Student A will attempt a memory task while Student B keeps time.\r\n[L93] Directions: Study the pairs of numbers on the index card for 30 seconds. Then \r\n[L94] turn the card over. Recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.). Then tell your part\ufffener (Student B) what you think the numbers on the card are. Student B will \r\n[L95] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L96] 5. Now it\u2019s Student B\u2019s turn to do a memory task while Student A records the data.\r\n[L97] Directions: Your partner will read the pairs of numbers on your index card aloud \r\n[L98] three times slowly. Next, you will recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.) and \r\n[L99] then tell your partner what you think the numbers on the card are. Student A will \r\n[L100] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L101] 6. Your teacher will scale and label axes on the board for parallel dotplots of the re\ufffesults. Plot the number of pairs you remembered correctly on the appropriate graph.\r\n[L102] 7. Did students in your class remember numbers better when they saw them or \r\n[L103] when they heard them? Give appropriate evidence to support your answer.\r\n[L104] 8. Based on the results of this experiment, can we conclude that people in gen\ufffeeral remember better when they see than when they hear?

We \r\n[L109] use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\n[L110] The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\n[L111] sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\n[L112] Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\n[L113] uses of sampling.","[L114] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L115] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","[L116] 208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L117] EXAMPLE\r\n[L118] EXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\n[L119] Populations and samples\r\n[L120] PROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n[L121] (a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\n[L122] before shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\n[L123] five pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\n[L124] moisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n[L125] (b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\n[L126] SOLUTION:\r\n[L127] (a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\n[L128] that are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n[L129] (b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\n[L130] For Practice Try Exercise 1\r\n[L131] The Idea of a Sample Survey\r\n[L132] We often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\n[L133] basis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\n[L134] and ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\n[L135] cream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\n[L136] whole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\n[L137] varied population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\n[L138] The first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\n[L139] what population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\n[L140] exactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\n[L141] We reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\n[L142] example. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\n[L143] or \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\n[L144] or more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example. We\u2019ll avoid this more \r\n[L145] restrictive terminology.\r\n[L146] Sample survey\r\n[L147] How Does the Current Population Survey Work?\r\n[L148] A sample survey\r\n[L149] One of the most important government sample surveys in the United States is \r\n[L150] the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS contacts about 60,000 \r\n[L151] households each month. It produces the monthly unemployment rate and much ","[L152] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://78b0ae7eaeb088a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":58525,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L153] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>","[L154] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 209\r\n[L155] The final step in planning a sample survey is to decide how to choose a sample \r\n[L156] from the population. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some good and not-so-good sam\ufffepling methods.\r\n[L157] How to Sample Badly\r\n[L158] How can we choose a sample that we can trust to represent the population? \r\n[L159] The easiest\u2014but not the best\u2014sampling method just chooses individuals who \r\n[L160] are close by. Suppose we\u2019re interested in finding out how long students at a \r\n[L161] large high school spent on homework last week, for example. We might go to \r\n[L162] the school library and ask the first 30 students we see about their homework \r\n[L163] time. A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\n[L164] easiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\n[L165] produce unrepresentative data.\r\n[L166] other economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\n[L167] specify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\n[L168] all U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\n[L169] not in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\n[L170] news refers to this specific population.\r\n[L171] What does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\n[L172] for example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\n[L173] she is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\n[L174] first asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\n[L175] work in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\n[L176] you are not in the labor force.\r\n[L177] If you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\n[L178] you did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\n[L179] you are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\n[L180] pay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\n[L181] because of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason. An unemployment rate \r\n[L182] of 9.7% means that 9.7% of the sample was unemployed, using the exact CPS \r\n[L183] definitions of both \u201clabor force\u201d and \u201cunemployed.\u201d\r\n[L184] DEFINITION: Convenience sample\r\n[L185] Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach results in a convenience sample.\r\n[L186] What\u2019s wrong with our convenience sample of students in the library? It\u2019s \r\n[L187] unlikely that this sample represents the homework habits of all students at the \r\n[L188] school well. In fact, we\u2019d expect the sample to overestimate the average homework \r\n[L189] time in the population since students who hang out in the library might tend to \r\n[L190] be more studious. This is bias: using a method that will consistently overestimate \r\n[L191] or underestimate the value you want to know.","[L192] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bea60ae105051c9#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_4.jpg","size_bytes":53957,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L193] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>","[L194] 210 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L195] EXAMPLE\r\n[L196] DEFINITION: Bias\r\n[L197] The design of a statistical study shows bias if it systematically favors certain outcomes.\r\n[L198] Convenience samples are almost guaranteed to show bias. So are voluntary \r\n[L199] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L200] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L201] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L202] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L203] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L204] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L205] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L206] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L207] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L208] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L209] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L210] to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\n[L211] Illegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\n[L212] Online polls\r\n[L213] Former CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\n[L214] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L215] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L216] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L217] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L218] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L219] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L220] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L221] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L222] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L223] his views.

In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L247] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L248] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L249] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L250] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L251] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L252] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L253] random sample.\r\n[L254] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L255] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L256] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L257] sample actually selected.\r\n[L258] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L259] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L260] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L261] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L262] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L263] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L264] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L265] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L266] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L267] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L268] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L269] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L270] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L271] if the population is large.

If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L280] random digits.\r\n[L281] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L282] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L283] these properties:\r\n[L284] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L285] s The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\n[L286] gives no information about any other part.\r\n[L287] Table D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\n[L288] digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\n[L289] in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\n[L290] the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\n[L291] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L292] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L293] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L294] same length.\r\n[L295] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L296] from Table D.\r\n[L297] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L298] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L299] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L300] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L301] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L302] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L303] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L304] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L305] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L306] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L307] and so on\u2014because the table has no order. We recommend reading across rows \r\n[L308] from left to right.","[L309] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://fed072027c0760d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_7.jpg","size_bytes":43027,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L310] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 75>","[L311] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 213\r\n[L312] Spring Break!\r\n[L313] Choosing an SRS with Table D\r\n[L314] The school newspaper is planning an article on family-friendly \r\n[L315] places to stay over spring break at a nearby beach town.

The applet sampled without replacement from the \u201cPopulation hop\ufffeper,\u201d but the calculator sampled with replacement from the specified population. \r\n[L397] As a result, the calculator sometimes selects the same number more than once in \r\n[L398] a given sample. To deal with this problem, you can generate additional random \r\n[L399] numbers as needed to replace any repeats. Or you can use a method other than \r\n[L400] randInt (like randSamp on the TI-Nspire) to sample without replacement.

Online\r\n[L404] and call-in polls also produce samples. But we can\u2019t trust results from these sam\ufffeples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. The first question to ask about \r\n[L405] any sample is whether it was chosen at random.\r\n[L406] Other Sampling Methods\r\n[L407] The basic idea of sampling is straightforward: take an SRS from the population \r\n[L408] and use your sample results to gain information about the population. Unfor\ufffetunately, it\u2019s usually very difficult to actually get an SRS from the population of \r\n[L409] interest. Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L410] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L411] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L412] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L413] selected.

Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L420] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L421] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L422] between strata.\r\n[L423] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L424] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L425] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L426] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L427] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L428] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L429] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L430] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L431] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size. Not convinced? Try \r\n[L432] the following Activity.\r\n[L433] ACTIVITY Sampling sunflowers\r\n[L434] A British farmer grows sunflowers for making sunflower oil. Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L435] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L436] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L437] money she\u2019ll make from selling them. It would take too much time to \r\n[L438] count the plants in all 100 squares, so she\u2019ll accept an estimate based on \r\n[L439] a sample of 10 squares.\r\n[L440] 1.

How did the three sampling methods do?\r\n[L472] The following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\n[L473] in the music business.\r\n[L474] Who Wrote That Song?\r\n[L475] Using a stratified random sample\r\n[L476] A radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\n[L477] The organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\n[L478] members by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\n[L479] ASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\n[L480] year. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L481] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L482] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L483] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L484] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L485] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L486] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L487] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L488] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L489] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L490] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L491] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L492] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L493] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups. Ideally, these \r\n[L494] clusters should mirror the characteristics of the population. Then choose an SRS of the \r\n[L495] clusters. All individuals in the chosen clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L496] Imagine a large high school that assigns its students to homerooms alphabeti\ufffecally by last name.

Be sure you understand the difference between strata and clusters. \r\n[L509] We want each stratum to contain similar individuals, and for there to be large \r\n[L510] differences between strata. For a cluster sample, we\u2019d like each cluster to look just \r\n[L511] like the population, but on a smaller scale.\r\n[L512] Sampling at a School Assembly\r\n[L513] Strata or clusters?\r\n[L514] The student council wants to conduct a survey during the first \r\n[L515] five minutes of an all-school assembly in the auditorium about \r\n[L516] use of the school library.

Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L619] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L620] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L621] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L622] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L623] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L624] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L625] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L626] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L627] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L628] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L629] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L630] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L631] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L632] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L633] Sampling Units, or PSUs. Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\n[L634] the 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\n[L635] of the others.\r\n[L636] Stage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\n[L637] Stratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\n[L638] Stage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\n[L639] units. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\n[L640] Analyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\n[L641] beyond basic statistics. But the SRS is the building block of more elaborate \r\n[L642] methods, and the principles of analysis remain much the same for these other \r\n[L643] methods.\r\n[L644] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L645] The manager of a sports arena wants to learn more about the financial status of the people \r\n[L646] who are attending an NBA basketball game.

Ticket prices for the game vary a \r\n[L647] great deal: seats near the court cost over $100 each, while seats in \r\n[L648] the top rows of the arena cost $25 each.

The \r\n[L666] process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\n[L667] called inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\n[L668] we know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\n[L669] response samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\n[L670] the population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\n[L671] selecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\n[L672] Still, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\n[L673] the entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\n[L674] the monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\n[L675] population. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\n[L676] almost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\n[L677] Inference\r\n[L678] ACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\n[L679] MATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\n[L680] other container that students can\u2019t see through\r\n[L681] In this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\n[L682] in relation to the population truth.\r\n[L683] 1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\n[L684] particular color.\r\n[L685] 2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\n[L686] record the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\n[L687] returned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n[L688] 3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\n[L689] is the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\n[L690] center? Is there a clear shape?\r\n[L691] Why can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\n[L692] results of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\n[L693] Because we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\n[L694] govern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\n[L695] results are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\n[L696] random sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\n[L697] the population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\n[L698] sets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\n[L699] for sampling later.\r\n[L700] One point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples. For instance, in the Activity, \r\n[L701] you would get a better estimate of the proportion of red chips in the popula\ufffeMargin of error","[L702] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 16 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://136106c58c36cbc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_15.jpg","size_bytes":54135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L703] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>","[L704] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 221\r\n[L705] tion using random samples of 40 chips than 20 chips. By taking a very large \r\n[L706] sample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\n[L707] about the population.\r\n[L708] The Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\n[L709] expect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\n[L710] of the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n[L711] 3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\n[L712] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L713] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L714] clicked a response.\r\n[L715] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L716] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L717] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L718] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L719] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L720] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L721] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L722] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L723] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L724] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L725] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L726] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L727] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L728] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L729] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L730] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L731] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L732] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L733] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L734] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L735] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L736] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L737] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L738] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L739] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L740] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L741] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L742] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L743] Sampling frame","[L744] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L745] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","[L746] 222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L747] EXAMPLE\r\n[L748] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L749] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L750] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L751] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L752] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L753] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L754] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L755] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L756] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L757] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L758] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L759] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L760] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L761] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L762] refuses to participate.\r\n[L763] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L764] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L765] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L766] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L767] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L768] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L769] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L770] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L771] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L772] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L773] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L774] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L775] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L776] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L777] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L778] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L779] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","[L780] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L781] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","[L782] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L783] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L784] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L785] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L786] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L787] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L788] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L789] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L790] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L791] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L792] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L793] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L794] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L795] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L796] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L797] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L798] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism.

Even the order in \r\n[L810] which questions are asked matters.\r\n[L811] How Do Americans Feel about Illegal Immigrants?\r\n[L812] Question wording matters\r\n[L813] \u201cShould illegal immigrants be prosecuted and deported for being in the U.S. illegally, \r\n[L814] or shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Asked this question in an opinion poll, 69% favored deportation. \r\n[L815] But when the very same sample was asked whether illegal immigrants who have \r\n[L816] worked in the United States for two years \u201cshould be given a chance to keep their jobs \r\n[L817] and eventually apply for legal status,\u201d 62% said that they should. Different questions \r\n[L818] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L819] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L820] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L821] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L822] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L823] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L824] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L825] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L826] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L827] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L828] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L829] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L830] 1. Each of the following is a source of error in a sample survey. Label each as sampling\r\n[L831] error or nonsampling error, and explain your answers.\r\n[L832] (a) The telephone directory is used as a sampling frame.\r\n[L833] (b) The person cannot be contacted in five calls.\r\n[L834] (c) Interviewers choose people walking by on the sidewalk to interview.\r\n[L835] 2. A survey paid for by makers of disposable diapers found that 84% of the sample opposed \r\n[L836] banning disposable diapers. Here is the actual question:\r\n[L837] It is estimated that disposable diapers account for less than 2% of the trash in today\u2019s \r\n[L838] landfills. In contrast, beverage containers, third-class mail and yard wastes are estimated\r\n[L839] to account for about 21% of the trash in landfills. Given this, in your opinion, would it \r\n[L840] be fair to ban disposable diapers?11\r\n[L841] Explain how the wording of the question could result in bias. Be sure to specify the direc\ufffetion of the bias.\r\n[L842] Wording of questions\r\n[L843] ?\r\n[L844] THINK\r\n[L845] ABOUT\r\n[L846] IT\r\n[L847] EXAMPLE","[L848] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 20 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://248f22efb09cc94#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_19.jpg","size_bytes":52135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L849] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>","[L850] s A sample survey selects a sample from the population of all individuals \r\n[L851] about which we desire information. We base conclusions about the \r\n[L852] population on data from the sample. It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L853] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L854] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L855] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L856] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L857] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L858] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L859] process.\r\n[L860] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L861] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L862] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L863] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L864] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L865] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L866] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L867] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L868] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L869] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L870] prone to large bias.\r\n[L871] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L872] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L873] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L874] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L875] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L876] errors. These have nothing to do with choosing a sample\u2014they are \r\n[L877] present even in a census. The single biggest problem for sample surveys \r\n[L878] is nonresponse: people can\u2019t be contacted or refuse to answer. Incorrect \r\n[L879] answers by respondents can lead to response bias. Finally, the exact \r\n[L880] wording of questions has a big influence on the answers.\r\n[L881] Summary SECTION 4.1\r\n[L882] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 225\r\n[L883] 4.1 TECHNOLOGY CORNER\r\n[L884] Choosing an SRS..................................................................... page 214\r\n[L885] TI-Nspire instructions in Appendix B","[L886] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://af94379ba136b08#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_20.jpg","size_bytes":47602,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 75>","[L888] 226 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L889] 1. Students as customers A high school\u2019s student \r\n[L890] newspaper plans to survey local businesses about the \r\n[L891] importance of students as customers. From telephone \r\n[L892] book listings, the newspaper staff chooses 150 busi\ufffenesses at random. Of these, 73 return the question\ufffenaire mailed by the staff. Identify the population and \r\n[L893] the sample.\r\n[L894] 2. Student archaeologists An archaeological dig turns \r\n[L895] up large numbers of pottery shards, broken stone \r\n[L896] tools, and other artifacts. Students working on the \r\n[L897] project classify each artifact and assign it a number. \r\n[L898] The counts in different categories are important for \r\n[L899] understanding the site, so the project director chooses \r\n[L900] 2% of the artifacts at random and checks the students\u2019 \r\n[L901] work. Identify the population and the sample.\r\n[L902] 3. Sampling stuffed envelopes A large retailer prepares \r\n[L903] its customers\u2019 monthly credit card bills using an \r\n[L904] automatic machine that folds the bills, stuffs them \r\n[L905] into envelopes, and seals the envelopes for mailing. \r\n[L906] Are the envelopes completely sealed? Inspectors \r\n[L907] choose 40 envelopes from the 1000 stuffed each hour \r\n[L908] for visual inspection. Identify the population and the \r\n[L909] sample.\r\n[L910] 4. Customer satisfaction A department store mails \r\n[L911] a customer satisfaction survey to people who make \r\n[L912] credit card purchases at the store. This month, 45,000 \r\n[L913] people made credit card purchases. Surveys are \r\n[L914] mailed to 1000 of these people, chosen at random, \r\n[L915] and 137 people return the survey form. Identify the \r\n[L916] population and the sample.\r\n[L917] 5. Call the shots A newspaper advertisement for an \r\n[L918] upcoming TV show said: \u201cShould handgun control \r\n[L919] be tougher? You call the shots in a special call-in \r\n[L920] poll tonight. If yes, call 1-900-720-6181. If no, call \r\n[L921] 1-900-720-6182.

Explain it to the congresswoman You are on the \r\n[L925] staff of a member of Congress who is considering a \r\n[L926] bill that would provide government-sponsored insur\ufffeance for nursing-home care. You report that 1128 letters \r\n[L927] have been received on the issue, of which 871 oppose \r\n[L928] the legislation. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that most of my con\ufffestituents oppose the bill.

Online polls In June 2008, Parade magazine posed \r\n[L938] the following question: \u201cShould drivers be banned \r\n[L939] from using all cell phones?\u201d Readers were encour\ufffeaged to vote online at parade.com. The July 13, 2008, \r\n[L940] issue of Parade reported the results: 2407 \r\n[L941] (85%) said \u201cYes\u201d and 410 (15%) said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n[L942] (a) What type of sample did the Parade survey \r\n[L943] obtain?\r\n[L944] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased.

Sleepless nights How much sleep do high school \r\n[L949] students get on a typical school night? An interested \r\n[L950] student designed a survey to find out. To make data \r\n[L951] collection easier, the student surveyed the first 100 \r\n[L952] students to arrive at school on a particular morning. \r\n[L953] These students reported an average of 7.2 hours of \r\n[L954] sleep on the previous night.\r\n[L955] (a) What type of sample did the student obtain?\r\n[L956] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n[L957] 7.2 hours probably higher or lower than the true aver\ufffeage amount of sleep last night for all students at the \r\n[L958] school? Why?\r\n[L959] 10. Sampling at the mall You have probably seen the \r\n[L960] mall interviewer, approaching people passing by with \r\n[L961] clipboard in hand. Explain why even a large sample \r\n[L962] of mall shoppers would not provide a trustworthy \r\n[L963] estimate of the current unemployment rate.\r\n[L964] 11. Do you trust the Internet?

Management would like to ensure \r\n[L1045] that the phones\u2019 display screens meet their quality \r\n[L1046] standards before shipping them to retail stores. Since \r\n[L1047] it takes about 10 minutes to inspect an individual \r\n[L1048] phone\u2019s display screen, managers decide to inspect a \r\n[L1049] sample of 20 phones from the day\u2019s production.\r\n[L1050] (a) Explain why it would be difficult for managers to \r\n[L1051] inspect an SRS of 20 iPhones that are produced today.\r\n[L1052] (b) An eager employee suggests that it would be easy \r\n[L1053] to inspect the last 20 iPhones that were produced \r\n[L1054] today. Why isn\u2019t this a good idea?\r\n[L1055] (c) Another employee recommends inspecting every \r\n[L1056] fiftieth iPhone that is produced. Explain carefully \r\n[L1057] why this sampling method is not an SRS.\r\n[L1058] 18. Dead trees On the west side of Rocky Mountain \r\n[L1059] National Park, many mature pine trees are dying due \r\n[L1060] to infestation by pine beetles.

Why is \r\n[L1067] this sampling method biased?\r\n[L1068] (c) Suppose that a more complicated random sam\ufffepling plan is carried out, and that 35% of the pine trees \r\n[L1069] in the sample are infested by the pine beetle. Can \r\n[L1070] scientists conclude that 35% of all the pine trees on the \r\n[L1071] west side of the park are infested? Why or why not?\r\n[L1072] 19. Who goes to the convention?

It decides to choose those who will \r\n[L1087] go by random selection. How will you label the two \r\n[L1088] strata? Use Table D, beginning at line 123, to choose \r\n[L1089] a stratified random sample of 4 students and 2 faculty \r\n[L1090] members.\r\n[L1091] 20. Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\n[L1092] stratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\n[L1093] records of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\n[L1094] stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\n[L1095] and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\n[L1096] One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\n[L1097] these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\n[L1098] amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000. Using these \r\n[L1099] groups as strata, you decide to verify all the largest \r\n[L1100] accounts and to sample 5% of the midsize accounts \r\n[L1101] and 1% of the small accounts. How would you label \r\n[L1102] the two strata from which you will sample? Use Table \r\n[L1103] D, starting at line 115, to select only the first 3 \r\n[L1104] accounts from each of these strata.\r\n[L1105] 21. Go Blue! Michigan Stadium, also known as \u201cThe Big \r\n[L1106] House,\u201d seats over 100,000 fans for a football game. \r\n[L1107] The University of Michigan athletic department plans \r\n[L1108] to conduct a survey about concessions that are sold \r\n[L1109] during games. Tickets are most expensive for seats \r\n[L1110] near the field and on the sideline. The cheapest seats \r\n[L1111] are high up in the end zones (where one of the au\ufffethors sat as a student). A map of the stadium is shown.\r\n[L1112] Visitor Sideline\r\n[L1113] Michigan Sideline\r\n[L1114] Sideline PRESS BOX ENDZONE\r\n[L1115] ENDZONE\r\n[L1116] 41 42 40\r\n[L1117] 39\r\n[L1118] 43 44 1 2 3 4 5 6\r\n[L1119] 7\r\n[L1120] 27 26 28\r\n[L1121] 29\r\n[L1122] 25\r\n[L1123] 35\r\n[L1124] 34\r\n[L1125] 33\r\n[L1126] 32\r\n[L1127] 31\r\n[L1128] 30\r\n[L1129] 36\r\n[L1130] 37\r\n[L1131] 38\r\n[L1132] 11\r\n[L1133] 12\r\n[L1134] 13\r\n[L1135] 14\r\n[L1136] 15\r\n[L1137] 16\r\n[L1138] 10\r\n[L1139] 9\r\n[L1140] 8\r\n[L1141] 24 23 22 21 20 19 18\r\n[L1142] 17\r\n[L1143] Corner\r\n[L1144] Endzone\r\n[L1145] (a) The athletic department is considering a stratified \r\n[L1146] random sample.

The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L1153] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L1154] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L1155] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L1156] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L1157] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L1158] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L1159] might be preferable to an SRS in this case.

A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L1164] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L1165] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L1166] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L1167] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L1168] Explain your answer.\r\n[L1169] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L1170] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L1171] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L1172] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L1173] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L1174] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L1175] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L1176] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L1177] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L1178] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L1179] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L1180] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L1181] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L1182] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L1183] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L1184] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L1185] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L1186] method?\r\n[L1187] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L1188] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L1189] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L1190] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L1191] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L1192] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L1193] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L1194] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1195] sample.\r\n[L1196] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L1197] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L1198] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L1199] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L1200] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L1201] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L1202] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L1203] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L1204] pg 218","[L1205] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1206] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","[L1207] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L1208] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1209] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200. Enter the \r\n[L1210] table at line 120.\r\n[L1211] (b) Like an SRS, a systematic random sample gives \r\n[L1212] all individuals the same chance to be chosen. Explain \r\n[L1213] why this is true. Then explain carefully why a system\ufffeatic sample is not an SRS.\r\n[L1214] 27. Sampling frame Ideally, the sampling frame in a \r\n[L1215] sample survey should list every individual in the \r\n[L1216] population, but in practice, this is often difficult. \r\n[L1217] Suppose that a sample of households in a community \r\n[L1218] is selected at random from the telephone directory. \r\n[L1219] Explain how this sampling method results in under\ufffecoverage that could lead to bias.\r\n[L1220] 28. Sampling frame Refer to the previous exercise. It is \r\n[L1221] more common in telephone surveys to use random \r\n[L1222] digit dialing equipment that selects the last four digits \r\n[L1223] of a telephone number at random after being given \r\n[L1224] the exchange (the first three digits). Explain how this \r\n[L1225] sampling method results in undercoverage that could \r\n[L1226] lead to bias.\r\n[L1227] 29. Baseball tickets Suppose you want to know the \r\n[L1228] average amount of money spent by the fans attending \r\n[L1229] opening day for the Cleveland Indians baseball sea\ufffeson. You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\n[L1230] to conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\n[L1231] allow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\n[L1232] seats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\n[L1233] you randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\n[L1234] stadium. During the game, you ask the fans in those \r\n[L1235] seats how much they spent that day.\r\n[L1236] (a) Provide a reason why this survey might yield a \r\n[L1237] biased result.\r\n[L1238] (b) Explain whether the reason you provided in (a) is \r\n[L1239] a sampling error or a nonsampling error.\r\n[L1240] 30. What kind of error? Which of the following are \r\n[L1241] sources of sampling error and which are sources of \r\n[L1242] nonsampling error? Explain your answers.\r\n[L1243] (a) The subject lies about past drug use.\r\n[L1244] (b) A typing error is made in recording the data.\r\n[L1245] (c) Data are gathered by asking people to mail in a \r\n[L1246] coupon printed in a newspaper.\r\n[L1247] 31. Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\n[L1248] sampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\n[L1249] the United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n[L1250] 5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\n[L1251] estimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n[L1252] (a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n[L1253] (b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\n[L1254] survey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n[L1255] 32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\n[L1256] in telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\n[L1257] call is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\n[L1258] The Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\n[L1259] nonresponse to a government survey of households \r\n[L1260] in Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\n[L1261] July 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\n[L1262] and 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\n[L1263] period versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\n[L1264] period.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\n[L1265] rate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\n[L1266] nonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n[L1267] 33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n[L1268] 31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\n[L1269] answer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\n[L1270] drove through, how many of them were red when you \r\n[L1271] entered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n[L1272] 171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\n[L1273] practical problem with this survey is that people may \r\n[L1274] not give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\n[L1275] of the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n[L1276] 880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n[L1277] 34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\n[L1278] belt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\n[L1279] chosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\n[L1280] they were invited to answer questions that included \r\n[L1281] questions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\n[L1282] always used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\n[L1283] seat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\n[L1284] lots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey. Do you expect bias in the same \r\n[L1285] direction in most surveys about seat belt use?\r\n[L1286] 35. Wording bias Comment on each of the following \r\n[L1287] as a potential sample survey question. Is the question \r\n[L1288] clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1289] (a) \u201cSome cell phone users have developed brain \r\n[L1290] cancer. Should all cell phones come with a warning \r\n[L1291] label explaining the danger of using cell phones?\u201d\r\n[L1292] (b) \u201cDo you agree that a national system of health \r\n[L1293] insurance should be favored because it would provide \r\n[L1294] health insurance for everyone and would reduce \r\n[L1295] administrative costs?\u201d\r\n[L1296] (c) \u201cIn view of escalating environmental degradation \r\n[L1297] and incipient resource depletion, would you favor \r\n[L1298] economic incentives for recycling of resource\ufffeintensive consumer goods?\u201d\r\n[L1299] 36. Checking for bias Comment on each of the fol\ufffelowing as a potential sample survey question. Is the \r\n[L1300] question clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1301] (a) Which of the following best represents your \r\n[L1302] opinion on gun control?\r\n[L1303] 1.

Sample surveys are one kind of observational\r\n[L1406] study. Other observational studies watch the behavior of animals in the wild or the \r\n[L1407] interactions between teacher and students in the classroom. This section is about \r\n[L1408] statistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\n[L1409] Observational Study versus Experiment\r\n[L1410] In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\n[L1411] ask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\n[L1412] response. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\n[L1413] of a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\n[L1414] DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\n[L1415] An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\n[L1416] does not attempt to influence the responses.\r\n[L1417] An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\n[L1418] responses.\r\n[L1419] The goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\n[L1420] to compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\n[L1421] of an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\n[L1422] response. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\n[L1423] way to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\n[L1424] see the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\n[L1425] is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\n[L1426] data. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\n[L1427] is one of the most important in statistics.\r\n[L1428] Does Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\n[L1429] after Menopause?\r\n[L1430] Observation versus experiment\r\n[L1431] Should women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\n[L1432] production of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\n[L1433] a heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\n[L1434] small compared with the benefits.\r\n[L1435] The evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\n[L1436] hormones with others who were not. But the women who chose to \r\n[L1437] take hormones were richer and better educated and saw doctors \r\n[L1438] more often than women who didn\u2019t take hormones.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L1466] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L1467] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L1468] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L1469] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L1470] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L1471] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L1472] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L1473] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L1474] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L1475] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L1476] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L1477] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L1478] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L1479] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L1480] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L1481] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L1482] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L1483] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L1484] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L1485] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L1486] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L1487] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L1488] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L1489] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L1490] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L1491] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L1492] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L1493] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L1494] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L1495] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L1496] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L1497] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","[L1498] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1499] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","[L1500] Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L1501] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L1502] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L1503] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L1504] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L1505] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L1506] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L1507] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L1508] results of the earlier observational studies.

Here is the basic vocabulary of experiments.\r\n[L1526] DEFINITION: Treatment, experimental units, subjects\r\n[L1527] A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment.\r\n[L1528] If an experiment has several explanatory variables, a treatment is a combination of \r\n[L1529] specific values of these variables.\r\n[L1530] The experimental units are the smallest collection of individuals to which treatments \r\n[L1531] are applied. When the units are human beings, they often are called subjects.\r\n[L1532] The best way to learn the language of experiments is to practice using it.\r\n[L1533] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1534] are asked to identify a \r\n[L1535] possible confounding \r\n[L1536] variable in a given \r\n[L1537] setting, you are \r\n[L1538] expected to explain how \r\n[L1539] the variable you choose \r\n[L1540] (1) is associated with \r\n[L1541] the explanatory variable \r\n[L1542] and (2) affects the \r\n[L1543] response variable.","[L1544] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1545] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>","[L1546] 234 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1547] EXAMPLE When Will I Ever Use This Stuff?\r\n[L1548] Vocabulary of experiments\r\n[L1549] Researchers at the University of North Carolina were concerned about the \r\n[L1550] increasing dropout rate in the state\u2019s high schools, especially for low-income stu\ufffedents. Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\n[L1551] started to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\n[L1552] To change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\n[L1553] the topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\n[L1554] To test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\n[L1555] the schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\n[L1556] standard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\n[L1557] curriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\n[L1558] years, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\n[L1559] scores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\n[L1560] high school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\n[L1561] greater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\n[L1562] PROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\n[L1563] in the CareerStart experiment.\r\n[L1564] SOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\n[L1565] variable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\n[L1566] compares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\n[L1567] behavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\n[L1568] The previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\n[L1569] trying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\n[L1570] all 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\n[L1571] of schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\n[L1572] researchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\n[L1573] systematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\n[L1574] students from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\n[L1575] program made the difference.\r\n[L1576] Sometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\n[L1577] experiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\n[L1578] treatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\n[L1579] the factors. Here\u2019s an example of a multifactor experiment.\r\n[L1580] Factors\r\n[L1581] Level\r\n[L1582] For Practice Try Exercise 51","[L1583] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://26b92d516ab78a7#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_29.jpg","size_bytes":63833,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1584] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>","[L1585] Section 4.2 Experiments 235\r\n[L1586] EXAMPLE TV Advertising\r\n[L1587] Experiments with multiple explanatory variables\r\n[L1588] What are the effects of repeated exposure to an advertising message? The answer \r\n[L1589] may depend on both the length of the ad and on how often it is repeat\ufffeed. An experiment investigated this question using undergraduate stu\ufffedents as subjects. All subjects viewed a 40-minute television program \r\n[L1590] that included ads for a digital camera. Some subjects saw a 30-second \r\n[L1591] commercial; others, a 90-second version. The same commercial was \r\n[L1592] shown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After viewing, all the \r\n[L1593] subjects answered questions about their recall of the ad, their attitude \r\n[L1594] toward the camera, and their intention to purchase it.21\r\n[L1595] PROBLEM: For the advertising study,\r\n[L1596] (a) identify the explanatory and response variables, and\r\n[L1597] (b) list all the treatments.\r\n[L1598] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1599] (a) This experiment has 2 explanatory variables (factors): \r\n[L1600] length of the commercial and number of repetitions. The response \r\n[L1601] variables include measures of subjects\u2019 recall of the ad, their \r\n[L1602] attitudes about the digital camera, and whether they intend to \r\n[L1603] purchase it.\r\n[L1604] (b) There are 2 different lengths of commercial (30 and 90 seconds) \r\n[L1605] and three different numbers of repetitions (1, 3, and 5). The 6 combi\ufffenations consisting of one level of each factor form the 6 treatments \r\n[L1606] shown in Figure 4.3: (1) 30 seconds, 1 time; (2) 30 seconds, 3 times; \r\n[L1607] (3) 30 seconds, 5 times; (4) 90 seconds, 1 time; (5) 90 seconds, \r\n[L1608] 3 times; (6) 90 seconds, 5 times.\r\n[L1609] This example shows how experiments allow us to study the combined effect of \r\n[L1610] several factors. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\n[L1611] not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\n[L1612] commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\n[L1613] interest. But if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers \r\n[L1614] get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. The two-factor experiment in \r\n[L1615] the TV advertising example will help us find out.\r\n[L1616] How to Experiment Badly \r\n[L1617] Experiments are the preferred method for examining the effect of one variable on \r\n[L1618] another. By imposing the specific treatment of interest and controlling other \r\n[L1619] influences, we can pin down cause and effect. Good designs are essential for \r\n[L1620] effective experiments, just as they are for sampling.

This year, budget cuts will allow the school to offer only an \r\n[L1649] online version of the course. Over the past 10 years, the average SAT \r\n[L1650] score of students in the classroom course was 1620. The online group \r\n[L1651] gets an average score of 1780. That\u2019s roughly 10% higher than the long\ufffetime average for those who took the classroom review course. Is the \r\n[L1652] online course more effective?\r\n[L1653] This experiment has a very simple design. A group of subjects (the \r\n[L1654] students) were exposed to a treatment (the online course), and the \r\n[L1655] outcome (SAT scores) was observed. Here is the design:\r\n[L1656] Students \u2192 Online course \u2192 SAT scores\r\n[L1657] A closer look showed that the students in the online review course \r\n[L1658] were quite different from the students who took the classroom course \r\n[L1659] in past years. They had higher GPAs and were taking more AP classes.\r\n[L1660] The effect of online versus in-class instruction is mixed up with the \r\n[L1661] effect of these lurking variables. Maybe the online students earned \r\n[L1662] higher SAT scores because they were smarter to begin with, not \r\n[L1663] because the online course prepared them better. This confounding \r\n[L1664] prevents us from concluding that the online course is more effective than class\uffferoom instruction.\r\n[L1665] Many laboratory experiments use a design like the one in the online SAT course \r\n[L1666] example:\r\n[L1667] Experimental units \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Measure response\r\n[L1668] In the lab environment, simple designs often work well. Field experiments and \r\n[L1669] experiments with animals or people deal with more variable conditions.

Most well-designed experiments compare \r\n[L1675] two or more treatments.\r\n[L1676] Comparison alone isn\u2019t enough to produce results we can trust. If the treat\ufffements are given to groups that differ greatly when the experiment begins, bias will \r\n[L1677] result.

Then put the slips in \r\n[L1706] a hat and mix them well. Have students come up one by one and (without looking) pick a slip from the \r\n[L1707] hat. This guarantees 25 students per group, with the treatments assigned by chance.\r\n[L1708] (b) We can use the two-step process from random sampling to do the random assignment.\r\n[L1709] Step 1: Label.

This type of design is \r\n[L1727] called a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1728] 50 volunteer\r\n[L1729] students\r\n[L1730] Random\r\n[L1731] assignment\r\n[L1732] Group 1\r\n[L1733] 25 students\r\n[L1734] Group 2\r\n[L1735] 25 students\r\n[L1736] Compare\r\n[L1737] SAT scores\r\n[L1738] Treatment 2\r\n[L1739] Classroom\r\n[L1740] Treatment 1\r\n[L1741] Online\r\n[L1742] FIGURE 4.4 Outline of a completely randomized design to compare online and classroom \r\n[L1743] instruction.\r\n[L1744] DEFINITION: Completely randomized design\r\n[L1745] In a completely randomized design, the treatments are assigned to all the experimen\ufffetal units completely by chance.\r\n[L1746] Notice that the definition of a completely randomized design does not require \r\n[L1747] that each treatment be assigned to an equal number of experimental units. It does \r\n[L1748] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L1749] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L1750] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L1751] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L1752] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L1753] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L1754] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1755] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L1756] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L1757] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L1758] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L1759] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L1760] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L1761] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L1762] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L1763] than it really is.\r\n[L1764] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments. Here \r\n[L1765] is an experiment that compares three treatments.\r\n[L1766] ?\r\n[L1767] THINK\r\n[L1768] ABOUT\r\n[L1769] IT","[L1770] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 34 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://805b683d71708bc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_33.jpg","size_bytes":52261,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1771] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 75>","[L1772] Section 4.2 Experiments 239\r\n[L1773] EXAMPLE Conserving Energy\r\n[L1774] A completely randomized design\r\n[L1775] Many utility companies have introduced programs to encourage energy con\ufffeservation among their customers. An electric company considers placing small \r\n[L1776] digital displays in households to show current electricity use and what the cost \r\n[L1777] would be if this use continued for a month. Will the displays reduce electricity \r\n[L1778] use? One cheaper approach is to give customers a chart and information about \r\n[L1779] monitoring their electricity use from their outside meter. Would this method \r\n[L1780] work almost as well? The company decides to conduct an experiment to com\ufffepare these two approaches (display, chart) with a control group of customers \r\n[L1781] who receive information about energy consumption but no help in monitoring \r\n[L1782] electricity use.\r\n[L1783] PROBLEM: Outline a completely randomized design involving 60 single-family residences in the \r\n[L1784] same city who are willing to participate in such an experiment.

You might be thinking that the change \r\n[L1843] in electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\n[L1844] would tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\n[L1845] Suppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\n[L1846] households might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\n[L1847] whether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\n[L1848] confounding?!)\r\n[L1849] Many experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\n[L1850] group that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\n[L1851] an active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\n[L1852] developed drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\n[L1853] work. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\n[L1854] control group.\r\n[L1855] Some experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group. That\u2019s appropriate \r\n[L1856] if researchers simply want to compare the effects of several treatments, and not \r\n[L1857] to determine whether any of them works better than an inactive treatment. For \r\n[L1858] instance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\n[L1859] of paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\n[L1860] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L1861] Music students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately. Can small-group \r\n[L1862] discussions help? The subjects were 29 students preparing for the end-of-semester per\ufffeformance that is an important part of their grade. Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L1863] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L1864] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L1865] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L1866] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L1867] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment. Follow the model of \r\n[L1868] Figure 4.4.\r\n[L1869] 2. Describe how you would carry out the random assignment. Provide enough detail that \r\n[L1870] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L1871] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L1872] Three Principles of \r\n[L1873] Experimental Design\r\n[L1874] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L1875] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L1876] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L1877] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L1878] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1879] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L1880] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L1881] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L1882] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1883] ?\r\n[L1884] THINK\r\n[L1885] ABOUT\r\n[L1886] IT","[L1887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","[L1888] Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L1889] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1890] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L1891] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L1892] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L1893] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L1894] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L1895] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L1896] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L1897] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L1898] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L1899] between the groups.\r\n[L1900] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L1901] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L1902] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L1903] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L1904] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L1905] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L1906] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L1907] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L1908] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L1909] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L1910] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L1911] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L1912] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L1913] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L1914] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L1915] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L1916] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L1917] experiment.\r\n[L1918] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L1919] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L1920] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks? The Phy\ufffesicians\u2019 Health Study was a medical experiment that helped answer this ques\ufffetion. In fact, the Physicians\u2019 Health Study looked at the effects of two drugs: \r\n[L1921] aspirin and beta-carotene. Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\n[L1922] help prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\n[L1923] male physicians. There were two explanatory variables (factors), each having \r\n[L1924] two levels: aspirin (yes or no) and beta-carotene (yes or no).

One\ufffefourth of the subjects were assigned at random to each of these treatments.\r\n[L1931] On odd-numbered days, the subjects took either a tablet that contained as\ufffepirin or a dummy pill that looked and tasted like the aspirin but had no \r\n[L1932] active ingredient (a placebo). On even-numbered days, they took either a \r\n[L1933] capsule containing beta-carotene or a placebo. There were several response \r\n[L1934] variables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\n[L1935] other medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\n[L1936] only 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\n[L1937] large enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\n[L1938] attacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\n[L1939] preventing cancer.\r\n[L1940] PROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\n[L1941] design was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\n[L1942] SOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\n[L1943] lurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\n[L1944] treatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\n[L1945] schedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\n[L1946] which subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\n[L1947] helped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\n[L1948] begin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\n[L1949] replication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\n[L1950] the groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\n[L1951] the random assignment.\r\n[L1952] The control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n[L1953] (placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\n[L1954] Experiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L1955] The logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\n[L1956] all the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\n[L1957] that all subjects really are treated identically.\r\n[L1958] If some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\n[L1959] group takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\n[L1960] the subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\n[L1961] experiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\n[L1962] On even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo. Many patients respond favorably to any treatment, even a placebo, perhaps \r\n[L1963] because they trust the doctor. The response to a dummy treatment is called the \r\n[L1964] Placebo\r\n[L1965] Factor 1:\r\n[L1966] Aspirin\r\n[L1967] Factor 2: Beta-carotene\r\n[L1968] Yes\r\n[L1969] Yes No\r\n[L1970] Aspirin Beta-carotene Aspirin Placebo\r\n[L1971] No\r\n[L1972] Placebo Beta-carotene Placebo Placebo\r\n[L1973] FIGURE 4.6 The treatments in the \r\n[L1974] Physicians\u2019 Health Study.","[L1975] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b06f1b5c1816f6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_37.jpg","size_bytes":61000,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1976] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>","[L1977] Section 4.2 Experiments 243\r\n[L1978] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1979] placebo effect. If some subjects did not take any pills, the effect of aspirin or \r\n[L1980] beta-carotene would be confounded with the placebo effect, the effect of simply \r\n[L1981] taking pills.\r\n[L1982] Curing Baldness and Soothing Pain\r\n[L1983] Do placebos work?\r\n[L1984] Want to help balding men keep their hair? Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\n[L1985] that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\n[L1986] heads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n[L1987] 24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\n[L1988] active medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\n[L1989] the pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\n[L1990] significantly less pain.24\r\n[L1991] When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\n[L1992] that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\n[L1993] placebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\n[L1994] treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\n[L1995] enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\n[L1996] place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\n[L1997] The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\n[L1998] their hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\n[L1999] beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\n[L2000] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L2001] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L2002] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L2003] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L2004] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L2005] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L2006] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L2007] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L2008] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L2009] Placebo effect","[L2010] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2011] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>","[L2012] 244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2013] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L2014] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L2015] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L2016] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L2017] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L2018] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L2019] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L2020] the response variable do know.\r\n[L2021] Single-blind\r\n[L2022] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L2023] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L2024] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L2025] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L2026] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L2027] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L2028] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L2029] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded.

Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L2034] experiment.\r\n[L2035] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L2036] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L2037] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L2038] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L2039] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L2040] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L2041] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L2042] significant.\r\n[L2043] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L2044] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L2045] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L2046] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L2047] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation. A statistically sig\ufffenificant association in data from a well-designed experiment does imply causation.","[L2048] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b86211c359fd2c0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_39.jpg","size_bytes":53857,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2049] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 41 / 75>","[L2050] Section 4.2 Experiments 245\r\n[L2051] ACTIVITY Distracted driving\r\n[L2052] MATERIALS: Deck of cards for each team of 3 to 4 students\r\n[L2053] Is talking on a cell phone while driving more distracting than talking to \r\n[L2054] a passenger? David Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah \r\n[L2055] designed an experiment to help answer this question. They used 48 un\ufffedergraduate students as subjects. The researchers randomly assigned half \r\n[L2056] of the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\n[L2057] the other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger. One \r\n[L2058] response variable was whether the driver stopped at a rest area that was \r\n[L2059] specified by researchers before the simulation started.

We need 48 cards from the deck to represent the drivers in this study. In the \r\n[L2069] original experiment, 33 drivers stopped at the rest area and 15 didn\u2019t. Since \r\n[L2070] we\u2019re assuming that the treatment received won\u2019t change whether each driver \r\n[L2071] stops at the rest area, we use 33 cards to represent drivers who stop and 15 cards \r\n[L2072] to represent those who don\u2019t.

Let\u2019s return \r\n[L2104] to the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\n[L2105] one group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L2106] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L2107] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L2108] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L2109] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L2110] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L2111] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L2112] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L2113] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L2114] response to the treatments.\r\n[L2115] Blocking\r\n[L2116] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L2117] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L2118] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L2119] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L2120] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

How \r\n[L2132] should researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water? They could \r\n[L2133] use a completely randomized design and hope that the \r\n[L2134] random assignment distributes the light-colored clothing \r\n[L2135] about evenly between the cold- and warm-water treatment \r\n[L2136] groups.

The idea is to create blocks by matching pairs of similar \r\n[L2262] experimental units. Then we can use chance to decide which member of a pair \r\n[L2263] gets the first treatment. The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L2264] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L2265] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L2266] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L2267] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L2268] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L2269] Matched pairs design\r\n[L2270] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L2271] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L2272] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L2273] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L2274] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L2275] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L2276] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L2277] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L2278] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L2279] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L2280] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L2281] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L2282] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L2283] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L2284] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L2285] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates?

Since you already sat or stood in Step 1, \r\n[L2295] you just need to do the opposite now. As before, everyone should measure their \r\n[L2296] pulses for one minute after completing the treatment (that is, once they are \r\n[L2297] standing or sitting).

Make a dotplot of these differences and cal\ufffeculate their mean. Is there evidence that standing pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2308] 5. What advantage does the matched pairs design have over the completely \r\n[L2309] randomized design?\r\n[L2310] An AP Statistics class with 24 students performed the \u201cGet Your Heart Beating\u201d \r\n[L2311] Activity. We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\n[L2312] EXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\n[L2313] Design determines analysis\r\n[L2314] A Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\n[L2315] randomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\n[L2316] standing group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n[L2317] 68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\n[L2318] higher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\n[L2319] pulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\n[L2320] graph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\n[L2321] standing pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\n[L2322] What about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\n[L2323] Fathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\n[L2324] rates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\n[L2325] difference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n[L2326] 24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\n[L2327] standing pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\n[L2328] evidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\n[L2329] Let\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\n[L2330] that we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\n[L2331] experimental designs.

For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\n[L2341] dotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\n[L2342] compare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\n[L2343] The following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\n[L2344] analyzing data from an experiment.\r\n[L2345] DATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\n[L2346] Most automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n[L2347] 78% nitrogen. Aircraft tires are filled with pure nitrogen, which is safer than air \r\n[L2348] in case of fire. Could filling automobile tires with nitrogen improve safety, perfor\ufffemance, or both?\r\n[L2349] Consumers Union designed a study to test whether nitrogen-filled tires would \r\n[L2350] maintain pressure better than air-filled tires. They obtained two tires from each of \r\n[L2351] several brands and then filled one tire in each pair with air and one with nitrogen. \r\n[L2352] All tires were inflated to a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch and then placed \r\n[L2353] outside for a year. At the end of the year, Consumers Union measured the pres\ufffesure in each tire. The amount of pressure lost (in pounds per square inch) during \r\n[L2354] the year for the air-filled and nitrogen-filled tires of each brand is shown in the \r\n[L2355] table below.29\r\n[L2356] Brand Air Nitrogen Brand Air Nitrogen\r\n[L2357] BF Goodrich Traction T/A HR 7.6 7.2 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 4.4 4.2\r\n[L2358] Bridgestone HP50 (Sears) 3.8 2.5 Sumitomo HTR H4 1.4 2.1\r\n[L2359] Bridgestone Potenza G009 3.7 1.6 Yokohama Avid H4S 4.3 3.0\r\n[L2360] Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.7 1.5 BF Goodrich Traction T/A V 5.5 3.4\r\n[L2361] Bridgestone Potenza EL400 2.1 1.0 Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.1 2.8\r\n[L2362] Continental Premier Contact H 4.9 3.1 Continental ContiExtreme Contact 5.0 3.4\r\n[L2363] Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 5.2 3.5 Continental ContiProContact 4.8 3.3\r\n[L2364] Dayton Daytona HR 3.4 3.2 Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 3.2 2.5\r\n[L2365] Falken Ziex ZE-512 4.1 3.3 General Exclaim UHP 6.8 2.7\r\n[L2366] Fuzion Hrl 2.7 2.2 Hankook Ventus V4 H105 3.1 1.4\r\n[L2367] General Exclaim 3.1 3.4 Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.5 1.5\r\n[L2368] Goodyear Assurance Tripletred 3.8 3.2 Michelin Pilot Exalto A/S 6.6 2.2\r\n[L2369] Hankook Optimo H418 3.0 0.9 Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 2.2 2.0\r\n[L2370] Kumho Solus KH16 6.2 3.4 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 2.5 2.7\r\n[L2371] Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.0 1.8 Sumitomo HTR+ 4.4 3.7\r\n[L2372] Michelin Pilot XGT H4 1.1 0.7\r\n[L2373] Does filling tires with nitrogen instead of compressed air reduce pressure loss? \r\n[L2374] Give appropriate graphical and numerical evidence to support your answer.","[L2375] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>","[L2376] 252 CHAPTER CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2377] s We can produce data intended to answer specific questions by observational\r\n[L2378] studies or experiments. An observational study gathers data on individuals \r\n[L2379] as they are. Experiments actively do something to people, animals, or \r\n[L2380] objects in order to measure their response.\r\n[L2381] s Statistical studies often try to show that changing one variable (the \r\n[L2382] explanatory variable) causes changes in another variable (the response\r\n[L2383] variable). Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\n[L2384] be distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\n[L2385] experiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\n[L2386] actually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\n[L2387] variable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\n[L2388] s In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\n[L2389] is a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\n[L2390] s The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\n[L2391] manner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\n[L2392] principles of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\n[L2393] assignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\n[L2394] s The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\n[L2395] two or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\n[L2396] with other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\n[L2397] s Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\n[L2398] Random assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\n[L2399] chance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\n[L2400] comparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\n[L2401] s Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\n[L2402] reduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\n[L2403] likely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\n[L2404] s Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\n[L2405] neither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\n[L2406] responses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\n[L2407] the other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\n[L2408] s Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\n[L2409] That helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\n[L2410] patients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\n[L2411] they have received an inactive treatment.\r\n[L2412] s In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\n[L2413] individuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\n[L2414] Randomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\n[L2415] helps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\n[L2416] s Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\n[L2417] treatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\n[L2418] treatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\n[L2419] closely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\n[L2420] Summary SECTION 4.2","[L2421] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","[L2423] Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n[L2424] 45.

Researchers began by \r\n[L2428] asking 305 healthy pregnant women to report their \r\n[L2429] chocolate consumption. Six months after birth, the \r\n[L2430] researchers asked mothers to rate their infants\u2019 tem\ufffeperament, including smiling, laughter, and fear.

Learning biology with computers An educator wants \r\n[L2452] to compare the effectiveness of computer software for \r\n[L2453] teaching biology with that of a textbook presentation. \r\n[L2454] She gives a biology pretest to each of a group of high \r\n[L2455] school juniors, then randomly divides them into \r\n[L2456] two groups. One group uses the computer, and the \r\n[L2457] other studies the text. At the end of the year, she \r\n[L2458] tests all the students again and compares the \r\n[L2459] increase in biology test scores in the two groups.\r\n[L2460] (a) Is this an observational study or an experiment? \r\n[L2461] Justify your answer.\r\n[L2462] (b) If the group using the computer has a much \r\n[L2463] higher average increase in test scores than the group \r\n[L2464] using the textbook, what conclusions, if any, could \r\n[L2465] the educator draw?\r\n[L2466] 48. Cell phones and brain cancer One study of cell \r\n[L2467] phones and the risk of brain cancer looked at a group \r\n[L2468] of 469 people who have brain cancer. The investiga\ufffetors matched each cancer patient with a person of \r\n[L2469] the same age, gender, and race who did not have \r\n[L2470] brain cancer, then asked about the use of cell phones. \r\n[L2471] Result: \u201cOur data suggest that the use of handheld \r\n[L2472] cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain \r\n[L2473] cancer.\u201d32\r\n[L2474] (a) Is this an observational study or an experiment? \r\n[L2475] Justify your answer.\r\n[L2476] (b) Based on this study, would you conclude that cell \r\n[L2477] phones do not increase the risk of brain cancer?

Effects of class size Do smaller classes in elementary \r\n[L2480] school really benefit students in areas such as scores \r\n[L2481] on standardized tests, staying in school, and going on \r\n[L2482] to college? We might do an observational study that \r\n[L2483] compares students who happened to be in smaller \r\n[L2484] and larger classes in their early school years. Identify \r\n[L2485] a lurking variable that may lead to confounding with \r\n[L2486] the effects of small classes. Explain how confounding \r\n[L2487] might occur.\r\n[L2488] 50. Effects of binge drinking A common definition of \r\n[L2489] \u201cbinge drinking\u201d is 5 or more drinks at one sitting for \r\n[L2490] men and 4 or more for women. An observational study \r\n[L2491] finds that students who binge drink have lower average \r\n[L2492] GPA than those who don\u2019t. Identify a lurking variable \r\n[L2493] that may be confounded with the effects of binge \r\n[L2494] drinking.

Growing in the shade Ability to grow in shade may \r\n[L2499] help pines found in the dry forests of Arizona to resist \r\n[L2500] drought.

Some students \r\n[L2517] will pay a low flat rate. Others will pay higher rates at \r\n[L2518] peak periods and very low rates off-peak. The univer\ufffesity is interested in the amount and time of use and in \r\n[L2519] the effect on the congestion of the network.\r\n[L2520] 53. Improving response rate How can we reduce the \r\n[L2521] rate of refusals in telephone surveys? Most people \r\n[L2522] who answer at all listen to the interviewer\u2019s introduc\ufffetory remarks and then decide whether to continue. \r\n[L2523] One study made telephone calls to randomly selected \r\n[L2524] households to ask opinions about the next election. In \r\n[L2525] some calls, the interviewer gave her name, in others \r\n[L2526] she identified the university she was representing, \r\n[L2527] and in still others she identified both herself and the \r\n[L2528] university. For each type of call, the interviewer either \r\n[L2529] did or did not offer to send a copy of the final survey \r\n[L2530] results to the person interviewed. Do these differences \r\n[L2531] in the introduction affect whether the interview is \r\n[L2532] completed?\r\n[L2533] 54. Eat well and exercise Most American adolescents \r\n[L2534] don\u2019t eat well and don\u2019t exercise enough. Can middle \r\n[L2535] schools increase physical activity among \r\n[L2536] their students? Can they persuade students to eat \r\n[L2537] better? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\n[L2538] intervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\n[L2539] school day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\n[L2540] for healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\n[L2541] school was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention. The \r\n[L2542] investigators observed physical activity and lunchtime \r\n[L2543] consumption of fat.\r\n[L2544] 55. Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\n[L2545] will use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\n[L2546] raise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\n[L2547] either 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n[L2548] 150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\n[L2549] combinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\n[L2550] fabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\n[L2551] for quality.\r\n[L2552] 56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\n[L2553] the increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\n[L2554] they stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\n[L2555] beat of a metronome. The step was either 5.75 or 11.5 \r\n[L2556] inches high and the metronome beat was 14, 21, or \r\n[L2557] 28 steps per minute. Five students stepped at each \r\n[L2558] combination of height and speed.\r\n[L2559] 57. Cocoa and blood flow A study conducted by Nor\ufffeman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham \r\n[L2560] and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, \r\n[L2561] involved 27 healthy people aged 18 to 72. Each \r\n[L2562] subject consumed a cocoa beverage containing 900 \r\n[L2563] milligrams of flavonols (a class of flavonoids) daily \r\n[L2564] for five days. Using a finger cuff, blood flow was mea\ufffesured on the first and fifth days of the study. After five \r\n[L2565] days, researchers measured what they called \u201csignifi\ufffecant improvement\u201d in blood flow and the function of \r\n[L2566] the cells that line the blood vessels.33 What flaw in the \r\n[L2567] design of this experiment makes it impossible to say \r\n[L2568] whether the cocoa really caused the improved blood \r\n[L2569] flow? Explain.\r\n[L2570] 58. Reducing unemployment Will cash bonuses speed \r\n[L2571] the return to work of unemployed people? A state \r\n[L2572] department of labor notes that last year 68% of people \r\n[L2573] who filed claims for unemployment insurance found \r\n[L2574] a new job within 15 weeks. As an experiment, this year \r\n[L2575] the state offers $500 to people filing unemployment \r\n[L2576] claims if they find a job within 15 weeks. The percent \r\n[L2577] who do so increases to 77%. What flaw in the design \r\n[L2578] of this experiment makes it impossible to say whether \r\n[L2579] the bonus really caused the increase? Explain.\r\n[L2580] 59. Layoffs and \u201csurvivor guilt\u201d Workers who survive a \r\n[L2581] layoff of other employees at their location may suffer \r\n[L2582] from \u201csurvivor guilt.\u201d A study of survivor guilt and \r\n[L2583] its effects used as subjects 120 students who were \r\n[L2584] offered an opportunity to earn extra course credit by \r\n[L2585] doing proofreading. Each subject worked in the same \r\n[L2586] cubicle as another student, who was an accomplice \r\n[L2587] of the experimenters. At a break midway through the \r\n[L2588] work, one of three things happened:\r\n[L2589] Treatment 1: The accomplice was told to leave; it was \r\n[L2590] explained that this was because she performed poorly.\r\n[L2591] Treatment 2: It was explained that unforeseen circum\ufffestances meant there was only enough work for one \r\n[L2592] person. By \u201cchance,\u201d the accomplice was chosen to \r\n[L2593] be laid off.\r\n[L2594] Treatment 3: Both students continued to work after \r\n[L2595] the break.\r\n[L2596] The subjects\u2019 work performance after the break \r\n[L2597] was compared with performance before the break.34\r\n[L2598] Describe how you would randomly assign the \r\n[L2599] subjects to the treatments\r\n[L2600] (a) using slips of paper.\r\n[L2601] (b) using Table D.\r\n[L2602] (c) using technology.\r\n[L2603] 60.

Then \r\n[L2652] carry out your random assignment.\r\n[L2653] 63. Treating prostate disease A large study used records \r\n[L2654] from Canada\u2019s national health care system to com\ufffepare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate \r\n[L2655] disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery \r\n[L2656] and a new method that does not require surgery. The \r\n[L2657] records described many patients whose doctors had \r\n[L2658] chosen each method. The study found that patients \r\n[L2659] treated by the new method were significantly more \r\n[L2660] likely to die within 8 years.36\r\n[L2661] (a) Further study of the data showed that this conclu\ufffesion was wrong. The extra deaths among patients who \r\n[L2662] got the new method could be explained by lurking vari\ufffeables. What lurking variables might be confounded with \r\n[L2663] a doctor\u2019s choice of surgical or nonsurgical treatment?\r\n[L2664] (b) You have 300 prostate patients who are willing to \r\n[L2665] serve as subjects in an experiment to compare the two \r\n[L2666] methods. Write a few sentences describing how you \r\n[L2667] would design this experiment.\r\n[L2668] 64. Getting teachers to come to school Elementary \r\n[L2669] schools in rural India are usually small, with a single \r\n[L2670] teacher. The teachers often fail to show up for work. \r\n[L2671] Here is an idea for improving attendance: give the \r\n[L2672] teacher a digital camera with a tamperproof time \r\n[L2673] and date stamp and ask a student to take a photo of \r\n[L2674] the teacher and class at the beginning and end of the \r\n[L2675] day. Offer the teacher better pay for good attendance, \r\n[L2676] verified by the photos. Will this work? Researchers \r\n[L2677] obtained permission to use 120 rural schools in \r\n[L2678] Rajasthan for an experiment to find out.37\r\n[L2679] (a) Explain why it would not be a good idea to offer \r\n[L2680] better pay for good attendance to the teachers in all \r\n[L2681] 120 schools and then to compare this year\u2019s atten\ufffedance with last year\u2019s.\r\n[L2682] (b) Write a few sentences describing how you would \r\n[L2683] design this experiment.\r\n[L2684] 65. Stronger players A football coach hears that a new \r\n[L2685] exercise program will increase upper-body strength \r\n[L2686] better than lifting weights. He is eager to test this new \r\n[L2687] program in the off-season with the players on his high \r\n[L2688] school team. The coach decides to let his players \r\n[L2689] choose which of the two treatments they will undergo \r\n[L2690] for 3 weeks\u2014exercise or weight lifting. He will use \r\n[L2691] the number of push-ups a player can do at the end of \r\n[L2692] the experiment as the response variable.\r\n[L2693] (a) Which principle of experimental design does the \r\n[L2694] coach\u2019s plan violate? Explain how this violation could \r\n[L2695] lead to confounding.\r\n[L2696] (b) Comment on the coach\u2019s choice of response \r\n[L2697] variable.\r\n[L2698] 66. Prayer and meditation You read in a magazine \r\n[L2699] that \u201cnonphysical treatments such as meditation and \r\n[L2700] prayer have been shown to be effective in controlled \r\n[L2701] scientific studies for such ailments as high blood \r\n[L2702] pg 239","[L2703] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 51 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://108fc5c94b0996f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_50.jpg","size_bytes":71434,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2704] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 52 / 75>","[L2705] 256 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2706] pressure, insomnia, ulcers, and asthma.\u201d Explain \r\n[L2707] in simple language what the article means by \r\n[L2708] \u201ccontrolled scientific studies.\u201d Why can such studies \r\n[L2709] provide good evidence that meditation is an effective \r\n[L2710] treatment for high blood pressure?\r\n[L2711] 67. The effects of day care Does day care help low\ufffeincome children stay in school and hold good jobs \r\n[L2712] later in life? The Carolina Abecedarian Project (the \r\n[L2713] name suggests the ABCs) has followed a group of \r\n[L2714] 111 children since 1972. Back then, these individu\ufffeals were all healthy but low-income black infants in \r\n[L2715] Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All the infants received \r\n[L2716] nutritional supplements and help from social workers. \r\n[L2717] Half were also assigned at random to an intensive \r\n[L2718] preschool program.38\r\n[L2719] (a) Explain the purpose of each of the three experi\ufffemental design principles.\r\n[L2720] (b) Describe how each of these principles was used \r\n[L2721] in this study.\r\n[L2722] 68. Killing weeds A biologist would like to determine \r\n[L2723] which of two brands of weed killer is less likely to \r\n[L2724] harm the plants in a garden at the university. Before \r\n[L2725] spraying near the plants, the biologist decides to \r\n[L2726] conduct an experiment using 24 individual plants. \r\n[L2727] Which of the following two plans for randomly \r\n[L2728] assigning the treatments should the biologist use? \r\n[L2729] Why?\r\n[L2730] Plan A: Choose the 12 healthiest-looking plants. \r\n[L2731] Apply Brand X weed killer to all 12 of those plants. \r\n[L2732] Apply Brand Y weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2733] Plan B: Choose 12 of the 24 plants at random. Apply \r\n[L2734] Brand X weed killer to those 12 plants and Brand Y \r\n[L2735] weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2736] 69. Do placebos really work? Researchers in Japan \r\n[L2737] conducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\n[L2738] were extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\n[L2739] each subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\n[L2740] told the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\n[L2741] subject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\n[L2742] was poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\n[L2743] the arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n[L2744] 13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\n[L2745] poison ivy leaf.39\r\n[L2746] (a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n[L2747] (b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\n[L2748] idea of a placebo effect.\r\n[L2749] 70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\n[L2750] chronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\n[L2751] and needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\n[L2752] will be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\n[L2753] percent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n[L2754] (a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\n[L2755] drug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n[L2756] (b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\n[L2757] getting the new drug or a placebo? How would this \r\n[L2758] knowledge probably affect their reactions?\r\n[L2759] 71. Meditation for anxiety An experiment that claimed \r\n[L2760] to show that meditation lowers anxiety proceeded as \r\n[L2761] follows. The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\n[L2762] and rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\n[L2763] were randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\n[L2764] meditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\n[L2765] simply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\n[L2766] the experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\n[L2767] and rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\n[L2768] now had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\n[L2769] Explain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\n[L2770] could bias the reported results.\r\n[L2771] 72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\n[L2772] testosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\n[L2773] cause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\n[L2774] fat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\n[L2775] supplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\n[L2776] in the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\n[L2777] with low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\n[L2778] a testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\n[L2779] in the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\n[L2780] described the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\n[L2781] placebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\n[L2782] terms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n[L2783] 73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\n[L2784] determine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\n[L2785] acupuncture could help infertile women become \r\n[L2786] pregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\n[L2787] undergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\n[L2788] were recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\n[L2789] randomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n[L2790] 25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\n[L2791] minutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\n[L2792] were instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\n[L2793] embryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n[L2794] 34 women became pregnant. In the control group, \r\n[L2795] 21 women became pregnant.\r\n[L2796] (a) Describe how the three principles of experimen\ufffetal design were addressed in this study.\r\n[L2797] (b) The difference in the percent of women who \r\n[L2798] became pregnant in the two groups is statistically \r\n[L2799] significant. Explain what this means to someone who \r\n[L2800] knows little statistics.\r\n[L2801] (c) Explain why the placebo effect prevents us from \r\n[L2802] concluding that acupuncture caused the difference in \r\n[L2803] pregnancy rates.\r\n[L2804] pg 241","[L2805] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>","[L2806] Section 4.2 Experiments 257\r\n[L2807] 74. Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\n[L2808] colleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\n[L2809] Half of the participants were randomly assigned \r\n[L2810] to a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\n[L2811] assigned to a low-fat diet. Researchers measured each \r\n[L2812] participant\u2019s change in weight and cholesterol level \r\n[L2813] after six months and again after one year. Subjects in \r\n[L2814] the low-carb diet group lost significantly more weight \r\n[L2815] than subjects in the low-fat diet group during the first \r\n[L2816] six months of the study. At the end of a year, however, \r\n[L2817] the average weight loss for subjects in the two groups \r\n[L2818] was not significantly different.42\r\n[L2819] (a) Why did researchers randomly assign the subjects \r\n[L2820] to the diet treatments?\r\n[L2821] (b) Explain to someone who knows little statistics \r\n[L2822] what \u201clost significantly more weight\u201d means.\r\n[L2823] (c) The subjects in the low-carb diet group lost an aver\ufffeage of 5.1 kg in a year. The subjects in the low-fat diet \r\n[L2824] group lost an average of 3.1 kg. Explain how this infor\ufffemation could be consistent with the fact that weight loss \r\n[L2825] in the two groups was not significantly different.\r\n[L2826] 75. Is yawning contagious? According to the popular \r\n[L2827] TV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\n[L2828] March 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\n[L2829] presented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\n[L2830] subjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\n[L2831] an extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\n[L2832] camera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\n[L2833] seed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\n[L2834] yawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\n[L2835] who had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\n[L2836] given a yawn seed, 10 yawned. Adam Savage and Ja\ufffemie Hyneman, the cohosts of Mythbusters, used these \r\n[L2837] results to conclude that yawning is contagious.\r\n[L2838] (a) Explain how you could use slips of paper to ran\ufffedomly reassign the subjects to the treatment groups.\r\n[L2839] (b) Suppose we used your method in (a) to redo the \r\n[L2840] random assignment 50 times.

The researchers decided to \r\n[L2846] analyze the patients\u2019 final pain ratings. It also makes \r\n[L2847] sense to examine the difference between patients\u2019 \r\n[L2848] initial pain ratings and their final pain ratings in both \r\n[L2849] groups.

Doctors and nurses Nurse-practitioners are nurses \r\n[L2864] with advanced qualifications who often act much like \r\n[L2865] primary-care physicians. Are they as effective as \r\n[L2866] doctors at treating patients with chronic conditions? \r\n[L2867] An experiment was conducted with 1316 patients \r\n[L2868] who had been diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, or \r\n[L2869] high blood pressure. Within each condition, patients \r\n[L2870] were randomly assigned to either a doctor or a \r\n[L2871] nurse-practitioner.

Comparing weight-loss treatments Twenty over\ufffeweight females have agreed to participate in a study \r\n[L2911] of the effectiveness of four weight-loss treatments: \r\n[L2912] A, B, C, and D. The researcher first calculates how \r\n[L2913] overweight each subject is by comparing the subject\u2019s \r\n[L2914] actual weight with her \u201cideal\u201d weight. The subjects \r\n[L2915] and their excess weights in pounds are as follows:\r\n[L2916] Birnbaum 35 Hernandez 25 Moses 25 Smith 29\r\n[L2917] Brown 34 Jackson 33 Nevesky 39 Stall 33\r\n[L2918] Brunk 30 Kendall 28 Obrach 30 Tran 35\r\n[L2919] Cruz 34 Loren 32 Rodriguez 30 Wilansky 42\r\n[L2920] Deng 24 Mann 28 Santiago 27 Williams 22\r\n[L2921] The response variable is the weight lost after 8 weeks of \r\n[L2922] treatment. Previous studies have shown that the effects \r\n[L2923] of a diet may vary based on a subject\u2019s initial weight.\r\n[L2924] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2925] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2926] setting.\r\n[L2927] (b) Should researchers form blocks of size 4 based on \r\n[L2928] subjects\u2019 last names in alphabetical order or by how \r\n[L2929] overweight the subjects are?

A nutrition experimenter intends to \r\n[L2934] compare the weight gain of newly weaned male \r\n[L2935] rats fed Diet A with that of rats fed Diet B. To do this, \r\n[L2936] she will feed each diet to 10 rats. She has available \r\n[L2937] 10 rats from one litter and 10 rats from a second \r\n[L2938] litter. Rats in the first litter appear to be slightly \r\n[L2939] healthier.\r\n[L2940] (a) If the 10 rats from Litter 1 were fed Diet A, the \r\n[L2941] effects of genetics and diet would be confounded, and \r\n[L2942] the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A. \r\n[L2943] Explain this statement carefully.\r\n[L2944] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2945] 82.

There are 8 lecture sections of a \r\n[L2952] basic statistics course at BYU, each with about 200 \r\n[L2953] students. There are four instructors, each of whom \r\n[L2954] teaches two sections.44 Suppose the sections and \r\n[L2955] lecturers are as follows:\r\n[L2956] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2957] 1 Hilton\r\n[L2958] 2 Christensen\r\n[L2959] 3 Hadfield\r\n[L2960] 4 Hadfield\r\n[L2961] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2962] 5 Tolley\r\n[L2963] 6 Hilton\r\n[L2964] 7 Tolley\r\n[L2965] 8 Christensen\r\n[L2966] (a) Suppose we randomly assign two lecturers to use \r\n[L2967] standard technology in their sections and the other \r\n[L2968] two lecturers to use multimedia technology.

Chocolate gets my heart pumping Cardiologists \r\n[L3000] at Athens Medical School in Greece wanted to test \r\n[L3001] whether chocolate affected blood flow in the blood \r\n[L3002] vessels. The researchers recruited 17 healthy young \r\n[L3003] volunteers, who were each given a 3.5-ounce bar of \r\n[L3004] dark chocolate, either bittersweet or fake chocolate. \r\n[L3005] On another day, the volunteers were switched. The \r\n[L3006] subjects had no chocolate outside the study, and \r\n[L3007] investigators didn\u2019t know whether a subject had eaten \r\n[L3008] the real or the fake chocolate. An ultrasound was \r\n[L3009] taken of each volunteer\u2019s upper arm to see the func\ufffetioning of the cells in the walls of the main artery. \r\n[L3010] The investigators found that blood vessel function was \r\n[L3011] improved when the subjects ate bittersweet chocolate, \r\n[L3012] and that there were no such changes when they ate \r\n[L3013] the placebo (fake chocolate).45\r\n[L3014] (a) What type of design did the investigators use in \r\n[L3015] their study?\r\n[L3016] (b) Explain why the investigators chose this design \r\n[L3017] instead of a completely randomized design.\r\n[L3018] (c) Why is it important to randomly assign the order \r\n[L3019] of the treatments for the subjects?\r\n[L3020] 85. Room temperature and dexterity An expert on \r\n[L3021] worker performance is interested in the effect of \r\n[L3022] room temperature on the performance of tasks \r\n[L3023] requiring manual dexterity. She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\n[L3024] variable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\n[L3025] a 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\n[L3026] requires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\n[L3027] subject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\n[L3028] make as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\n[L3029] continuous effort.\r\n[L3030] (a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\n[L3031] compare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\n[L3032] available.\r\n[L3033] (b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\n[L3034] wide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\n[L3035] subjects in each group.

Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\n[L3039] of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\n[L3040] increasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\n[L3041] Because plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\n[L3042] CO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\n[L3043] An elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\n[L3044] CO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\n[L3045] the growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\n[L3046] untreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\n[L3047] growth.

Can changing diet reduce high blood pressure? \r\n[L3098] Vegetarian diets and low-salt diets are both promising. \r\n[L3099] Men with high blood pressure are assigned at random \r\n[L3100] to four diets: (1) normal diet with unrestricted salt; \r\n[L3101] (2) vegetarian with unrestricted salt; (3) normal with \r\n[L3102] restricted salt; and (4) vegetarian with restricted salt. \r\n[L3103] This experiment has\r\n[L3104] (a) one factor, the type of diet.\r\n[L3105] (b) two factors, high blood pressure and type of diet.\r\n[L3106] (c) two factors, normal/vegetarian diet and unre\ufffestricted/restricted salt.\r\n[L3107] (d) three factors, men, high blood pressure, and type \r\n[L3108] of diet.\r\n[L3109] (e) four factors, the four diets being compared.\r\n[L3110] 92.

Is this \r\n[L3152] good evidence that ibuprofen is effective in prevent\ufffeing Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\r\n[L3153] (a) Yes, because the study was a randomized, \r\n[L3154] comparative experiment.\r\n[L3155] (b) No, because the effect of ibuprofen is confounded \r\n[L3156] with the placebo effect.\r\n[L3157] (c) Yes, because the results were published in a \r\n[L3158] reputable professional journal.\r\n[L3159] (d) No, because this is an observational study.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L3219] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L3220] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L3221] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L3222] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L3223] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L3224] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3225] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L3226] on the design of the study.\r\n[L3227] Scope of Inference\r\n[L3228] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L3229] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L3230] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L3231] results of the sample.\r\n[L3232] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L3233] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L3234] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L3235] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L3236] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L3237] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L3238] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L3239] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L3240] 4.3\r\n[L3241] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","[L3242] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3243] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","[L3244] 262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3245] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L3246] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L3247] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L3248] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L3249] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L3250] Yes No\r\n[L3251] Were individuals \r\n[L3252] randomly selected?\r\n[L3253] Yes\r\n[L3254] Inference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\n[L3255] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3256] No Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\n[L3257] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3258] Well-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\n[L3259] However, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\n[L3260] larger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\n[L3261] effect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\n[L3262] rules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\n[L3263] random sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\n[L3264] example illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\n[L3265] EXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\n[L3266] Determining scope of inference\r\n[L3267] A small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\n[L3268] The dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\n[L3269] Design 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3270] to take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L3271] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L3272] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L3273] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L3274] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3275] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L3276] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3277] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3278] part in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3279] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3280] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L3281] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3282] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L3283] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L3284] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L3285] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L3286] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L3287] SOLUTION:\r\n[L3288] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L3289] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments ","[L3290] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a9a2c4c5c24a51b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_57.jpg","size_bytes":59616,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3291] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>","[L3292] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L3293] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3294] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L3295] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L3296] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L3297] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L3298] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L3299] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L3300] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L3301] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L3302] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L3303] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L3304] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L3305] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L3306] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L3307] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L3308] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L3309] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L3310] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L3311] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L3312] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L3313] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L3314] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L3315] the town.\r\n[L3316] The Challenges of \r\n[L3317] Establishing Causation\r\n[L3318] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L3319] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L3320] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L3321] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L3322] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L3323] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L3324] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\n[L3325] Lack of realism\r\n[L3326] Do those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3327] since 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\n[L3328] showed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\n[L3329] But requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\n[L3330] What happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\n[L3331] all cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\n[L3332] For Practice Try Exercise 105","[L3333] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3334] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","[L3335] 264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3336] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3337] In some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\n[L3338] these important questions:\r\n[L3339] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L3340] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L3341] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L3342] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L3343] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L3344] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L3345] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L3346] studies.\r\n[L3347] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L3348] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L3349] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L3350] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L3351] Living with observational studies\r\n[L3352] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L3353] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L3354] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L3355] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L3356] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L3357] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L3358] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L3359] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L3360] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L3361] experiment?\r\n[L3362] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L3363] very strong.\r\n[L3364] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L3365] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L3366] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L3367] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L3368] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L3369] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L3370] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L3371] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L3372] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L3373] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L3374] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L3375] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L3376] cancer death among women.","[L3377] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3378] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","[L3379] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L3380] sThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\n[L3381] cigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\n[L3382] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L3383] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3384] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L3385] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L3386] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L3387] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\n[L3388] observational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\n[L3389] Data Ethics*\r\n[L3390] Medical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\n[L3391] Shouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\n[L3392] reasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L3393] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L3394] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L3395] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L3396] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L3397] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L3398] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L3399] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L3400] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L3401] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L3402] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L3403] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\n[L3404] knows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\n[L3405] the physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\n[L3406] sWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L3407] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L3408] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L3409] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L3410] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L3411] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\n[L3412] are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\n[L3413] data from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\n[L3414] Basic Data Ethics\r\n[L3415] All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\n[L3416] board charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\n[L3417] All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\n[L3418] before data are collected.\r\n[L3419] All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\n[L3420] groups of subjects may be made public.\r\n[L3421] *This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","[L3422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","[L3423] 266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3424] The law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\n[L3425] obey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\n[L3426] Institutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\n[L3427] to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\n[L3428] it is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\n[L3429] board, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\n[L3430] recruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\n[L3431] study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\n[L3432] are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\n[L3433] research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\n[L3434] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L3435] boards.\r\n[L3436] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L3437] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L3438] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L3439] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L3440] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L3441] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L3442] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L3443] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L3444] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L3445] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L3446] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L3447] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L3448] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L3449] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L3450] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity.

The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L3456] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L3457] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L3458] other identification have been removed from the data available for search.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L3496] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L3497] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L3498] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L3499] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L3500] results.\r\n[L3501] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L3502] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L3503] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L3504] lurking variables.\r\n[L3505] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L3506] review board.

Researchers carried \r\n[L3515] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L3516] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\n[L3517] dotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\n[L3518] magnet).\r\n[L3519] The average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\n[L3520] and 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\n[L3521] significant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\n[L3522] The difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\n[L3523] too large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain.

According to \r\n[L3558] Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain,\r\n[L3559] women say nearly three times as many words per day \r\n[L3560] as men. Skeptical researchers devised a study to test \r\n[L3561] this claim.

But even after health behaviors were \r\n[L3582] taken into account, those not attending religious \r\n[L3583] services regularly still were about 25% more likely to \r\n[L3584] have died.\u201d57 What conclusion can we draw from \r\n[L3585] this study?

The researchers \r\n[L3684] argued that almost all children in the institution \r\n[L3685] quickly became infected anyway. The studies \r\n[L3686] showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis \r\n[L3687] existed. This finding contributed to the development \r\n[L3688] of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, \r\n[L3689] the Willowbrook studies are now considered an \r\n[L3690] example of unethical research. Explain why, \r\n[L3691] according to current ethical standards, useful results \r\n[L3692] are not enough to allow a study.\r\n[L3693] 116.* Unequal benefits Researchers on aging proposed to \r\n[L3694] investigate the effect of supplemental health services \r\n[L3695] on the quality of life of older people. Eligible \r\n[L3696] patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to \r\n[L3697] be randomly assigned to treatment and control \r\n[L3698] groups. The treatment group would be offered \r\n[L3699] hearing aids, dentures, transportation, and other \r\n[L3700] services not available without charge to the control \r\n[L3701] group. The review board felt that providing these \r\n[L3702] services to some but not other persons in the same \r\n[L3703] institution raised ethical questions. Do you agree?\r\n[L3704] 117. Animal testing (1.1) \u201cIt is right to use animals for \r\n[L3705] medical testing if it might save human lives.\u201d The \r\n[L3706] General Social Survey asked 1152 adults to react to this \r\n[L3707] statement.

Initial public offerings (1.3) The business \r\n[L3718] magazine Forbes reports that 4567 companies sold \r\n[L3719] their first stock to the public between 1990 and \r\n[L3720] 2000. The mean change in the stock price of these \r\n[L3721] companies since the first stock was issued was \r\n[L3722] +111%. The median change was \u221231%.58 Explain \r\n[L3723] how this could happen.

Ontario Health Survey The Ministry of Health in \r\n[L3757] the province of Ontario, Canada, wants to know whether \r\n[L3758] the national health care system is achieving its goals in the \r\n[L3759] province. Much information about health care comes from \r\n[L3760] patient records, but that source doesn\u2019t allow us to compare \r\n[L3761] people who use health services with those who don\u2019t. So \r\n[L3762] the Ministry of Health conducted the Ontario Health Sur\ufffevey, which interviewed a random sample of 61,239 people \r\n[L3763] who live in the province of Ontario.59\r\n[L3764] (a) What is the population for this sample survey? \r\n[L3765] What is the sample?\r\n[L3766] (b) The survey found that 76% of males and 86% of \r\n[L3767] females in the sample had visited a general practi\ufffetioner at least once in the past year.

Polling the faculty A researcher wants to study the \r\n[L3805] attitudes of college faculty members about the work hab\ufffeits of entering freshmen. These attitudes appear to differ \r\n[L3806] depending on the type of college. The American Associa\ufffetion of University Professors classifies colleges as follows:\r\n[L3807] Class I: Offer doctorate degrees and award at least 15 \r\n[L3808] per year.\r\n[L3809] Class IIA: Award degrees above the bachelor\u2019s but are \r\n[L3810] not in Class I.\r\n[L3811] Class IIB: Award no degrees beyond the bachelor\u2019s.\r\n[L3812] Class III: Two-year colleges.\r\n[L3813] The researcher would like to survey about 200 faculty mem\ufffebers.

Are anesthetics safe? The National Halothane Study \r\n[L3831] was a major investigation of the safety of anesthetics used \r\n[L3832] in surgery. Records of over 850,000 operations performed \r\n[L3833] in 34 major hospitals showed the following death rates for \r\n[L3834] four common anesthetics:60\r\n[L3835] Anesthetic: A B C D\r\n[L3836] Death rate: 1.7% 1.7% 3.4% 1.9%\r\n[L3837] There seems to be a clear association between the anesthet\ufffeic used and the death rate of patients. Anesthetic C appears\r\n[L3838] to be dangerous.\r\n[L3839] (a) Explain why we call the National Halothane Study \r\n[L3840] an observational study rather than an experiment,\r\n[L3841] even though it compared the results of using dif\ufffeferent anesthetics in actual surgery.\r\n[L3842] (b) When the study looked at lurking variables that \r\n[L3843] are related to a doctor\u2019s choice of anesthetic, it \r\n[L3844] found that Anesthetic C was not causing extra \r\n[L3845] deaths.

Ugly fries Few people want to eat discolored \r\n[L3851] french fries. Potatoes are kept refrigerated before being \r\n[L3852] cut for french fries to prevent spoiling and preserve flavor. \r\n[L3853] But immediate processing of cold potatoes causes discol\ufffeoring due to complex chemical reactions. The potatoes \r\n[L3854] must therefore be brought to room temperature before \r\n[L3855] processing. Researchers want to design an experiment in \r\n[L3856] which tasters will rate the color and flavor of french fries \r\n[L3857] prepared from several groups of potatoes. The potatoes \r\n[L3858] will be freshly picked or stored for a month at room tem\ufffeperature or stored for a month refrigerated. They will then \r\n[L3859] be sliced and cooked either immediately or after an hour \r\n[L3860] at room temperature.

Vitamin C for marathon runners An ultrama\uffferathon, as you might guess, is a footrace longer than the \r\n[L3896] 26.2 miles of a marathon. Runners commonly develop \r\n[L3897] respiratory infections after an ultramarathon. Will taking \r\n[L3898] 600 milligrams of vitamin C daily reduce those infec\ufffetions?

A study of treatments for angina (pain due to low \r\n[L3970] blood supply to the heart) compared bypass surgery, angio\ufffeplasty, and use of drugs. The study looked at the medical \r\n[L3971] records of thousands of angina patients whose doctors had \r\n[L3972] chosen one of these treatments. It found that the average \r\n[L3973] survival time of patients given drugs was the highest. What \r\n[L3974] do you conclude?\r\n[L3975] (a) This study proves that drugs prolong life and should be \r\n[L3976] the treatment of choice.\r\n[L3977] (b) We can conclude that drugs prolong life because the \r\n[L3978] study was a comparative experiment.\r\n[L3979] (c) We can\u2019t conclude that drugs prolong life because the \r\n[L3980] patients were volunteers.\r\n[L3981] (d) We can\u2019t conclude that drugs prolong life because this \r\n[L3982] was an observational study.\r\n[L3983] (e) We can\u2019t conclude that drugs prolong life because no \r\n[L3984] placebo was used.\r\n[L3985] T4.4.

What is the \r\n[L3996] best reason for randomly assigning treatment levels (spray\ufffeing or not spraying) to the experimental units (farms)?\r\n[L3997] (a) Random assignment makes the experiment easier to \r\n[L3998] conduct since we can apply the insecticide in any pattern \r\n[L3999] rather than in a systematic fashion.\r\n[L4000] (b) Random assignment will tend to average out all other \r\n[L4001] uncontrolled factors such as soil fertility so that they are not \r\n[L4002] confounded with the treatment effects.\r\n[L4003] (c) Random assignment makes the analysis easier since \r\n[L4004] the data can be collected and entered into the computer \r\n[L4005] in any order.\r\n[L4006] (d) Random assignment is required by statistical consul\ufffetants before they will help you analyze the experiment.\r\n[L4007] (e) Random assignment implies that it is not necessary to \r\n[L4008] be careful during the experiment, during data collection, \r\n[L4009] and during data analysis.\r\n[L4010] T4.6. The most important advantage of experiments over \r\n[L4011] observational studies is that\r\n[L4012] (a) experiments are usually easier to carry out.\r\n[L4013] (b) experiments can give better evidence of causation.\r\n[L4014] (c) confounding cannot happen in experiments.\r\n[L4015] (d) an observational study cannot have a response variable.\r\n[L4016] (e) observational studies cannot use random samples.\r\n[L4017] T4.7.

Which of the following statements \r\n[L4285] is true?\r\n[L4286] I. There is a high positive correlation between the \r\n[L4287] number of days that have passed since the box of dish\ufffewasher powder was opened and the amount of powder \r\n[L4288] left in the box.\r\n[L4289] II. A scatterplot with days since purchase as the explana\ufffetory variable and amount of dishwasher powder used as \r\n[L4290] the response variable would display a strong positive \r\n[L4291] association.\r\n[L4292] III.

The General Social Survey (GSS), conducted by \r\n[L4297] the National Opinion Research Center at the University \r\n[L4298] of Chicago, is a major source of data on social attitudes in \r\n[L4299] the United States. Once each year, 1500 adults are inter\ufffeviewed in their homes all across the country. The subjects \r\n[L4300] are asked their opinions about sex and marriage, attitudes \r\n[L4301] toward women, welfare, foreign policy, and many other \r\n[L4302] issues. The GSS begins by selecting a sample of counties \r\n[L4303] from the 3000 counties in the country. The counties are \r\n[L4304] divided into urban, rural, and suburban; a separate sample \r\n[L4305] is chosen at random from each group.

You are planning an experiment to determine \r\n[L4317] the effect of the brand of gasoline and the weight of a car \r\n[L4318] on gas mileage measured in miles per gallon. You will use \r\n[L4319] a single test car, adding weights so that its total weight is \r\n[L4320] 3000, 3500, or 4000 pounds. The car will drive on a test \r\n[L4321] track at each weight using each of Amoco, Marathon, and \r\n[L4322] Speedway gasoline.

Those who advocate for monetary incentives in \r\n[L4403] a work environment claim that this type of incentive has \r\n[L4404] the greatest appeal because it allows the winners to do what \r\n[L4405] they want with their winnings.

Not only are there national brands for \r\n[L4428] most products, but many stores have their own in-house \r\n[L4429] brands. Since shelf space is not infinite, the question is \r\n[L4430] how many linear feet to allocate to each product and \r\n[L4431] which shelf (top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle) \r\n[L4432] to put it on. The middle shelf is the most popular and lu\ufffecrative, since many shoppers, if undecided, will simply \r\n[L4433] pick the product that is at eye level. \r\n[L4434] A local store that sells many upscale goods is trying to \r\n[L4435] determine how much shelf space to allocate to its own \r\n[L4436] brand of men\u2019s personal-grooming products.

By the end of the chapter, you\u2019ll be ready to interpret \r\n[L7] the results of this study.\r\n[L8] Early research showed that magnetic fields affected living tissue in humans. Some doc\ufffetors have begun to use magnets to treat patients with chronic pain. Scientists wondered \r\n[L9] whether this type of therapy really worked. They designed a study to find out.\r\n[L10] Fifty patients with chronic pain were recruited for the study. A doctor identified a painful \r\n[L11] site on each patient and asked him or her to rate the pain on a scale from 0 (mild pain) to \r\n[L12] 10 (severe pain). Then, the doctor selected a sealed envelope containing a magnet from a \r\n[L13] box that contained both active and inactive magnets. That way, neither the doctor nor the \r\n[L14] patient knew which type of magnet was being used. The chosen magnet was applied to \r\n[L15] the site of the pain for 45 minutes. After \u201ctreatment,\u201d each patient was again asked to rate \r\n[L16] the level of pain from 0 to 10.\r\n[L17] In all, 29 patients were given active magnets and 21 patients received inactive magnets. \r\n[L18] All but one of the patients rated their initial pain as an 8, 9, or 10.

Here are \r\n[L26] some examples:\r\n[L27] sThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\n[L28] seat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\n[L29] sAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\n[L30] an average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\n[L31] teens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\n[L32] unsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\n[L33] sA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\n[L34] of catching a cold.4\r\n[L35] sFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\n[L36] that listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\n[L37] Can we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\n[L38] depends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\n[L39] look at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\n[L40] Each year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\n[L41] vehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\n[L42] people in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\n[L43] of an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\n[L44] asking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\n[L45] conducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\n[L46] about some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\n[L47] In the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\n[L48] questions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\n[L49] them a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\n[L50] observational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\n[L51] drawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\n[L52] while listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\n[L53] list of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\n[L54] The goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\n[L55] changes in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\n[L56] the ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\n[L57] Here\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\n[L58] ACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\n[L59] MATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\n[L60] clock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\n[L61] Confucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget.

To answer the question, we will interview 16- to 20-year-olds \r\n[L70] who live in the United States and drive. Ideally, we would ask them all (take a \r\n[L71] census). But contacting every driver in this age group wouldn\u2019t be practical: it \r\n[L72] would take too much time and cost too much money. Instead, we put the question \r\n[L73] to a sample chosen to represent the entire population of young drivers.\r\n[L74] 4.1\r\n[L75] In Section 4.1, \r\n[L76] you\u2019ll learn about: \r\n[L77] sThe idea of a sample \r\n[L78] survey\r\n[L79] sHow to sample badly\r\n[L80] sHow to sample well: \r\n[L81] Random sampling\r\n[L82] sOther sampling methods\r\n[L83] sInference for sampling\r\n[L84] sSample surveys: What \r\n[L85] can go wrong?\r\n[L86] 1.

Do not look at the numbers until it is time for you to do the \r\n[L89] experiment.\r\n[L90] 3. Flip a coin to decide which of you is Student A and which is Student B. \r\n[L91] Shuffle the index cards and deal one face down to each partner.\r\n[L92] 4. Student A will attempt a memory task while Student B keeps time.\r\n[L93] Directions: Study the pairs of numbers on the index card for 30 seconds. Then \r\n[L94] turn the card over. Recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.). Then tell your part\ufffener (Student B) what you think the numbers on the card are. Student B will \r\n[L95] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L96] 5. Now it\u2019s Student B\u2019s turn to do a memory task while Student A records the data.\r\n[L97] Directions: Your partner will read the pairs of numbers on your index card aloud \r\n[L98] three times slowly. Next, you will recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.) and \r\n[L99] then tell your partner what you think the numbers on the card are. Student A will \r\n[L100] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L101] 6. Your teacher will scale and label axes on the board for parallel dotplots of the re\ufffesults.

We \r\n[L109] use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\n[L110] The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\n[L111] sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\n[L112] Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\n[L113] uses of sampling.","[L114] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L115] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","[L116] 208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L117] EXAMPLE\r\n[L118] EXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\n[L119] Populations and samples\r\n[L120] PROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n[L121] (a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\n[L122] before shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\n[L123] five pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\n[L124] moisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n[L125] (b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\n[L126] SOLUTION:\r\n[L127] (a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\n[L128] that are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n[L129] (b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\n[L130] For Practice Try Exercise 1\r\n[L131] The Idea of a Sample Survey\r\n[L132] We often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\n[L133] basis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\n[L134] and ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\n[L135] cream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\n[L136] whole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\n[L137] varied population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\n[L138] The first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\n[L139] what population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\n[L140] exactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\n[L141] We reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\n[L142] example. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\n[L143] or \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\n[L144] or more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example. We\u2019ll avoid this more \r\n[L145] restrictive terminology.\r\n[L146] Sample survey\r\n[L147] How Does the Current Population Survey Work?\r\n[L148] A sample survey\r\n[L149] One of the most important government sample surveys in the United States is \r\n[L150] the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS contacts about 60,000 \r\n[L151] households each month. It produces the monthly unemployment rate and much ","[L152] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://78b0ae7eaeb088a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":58525,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L153] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>","[L154] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 209\r\n[L155] The final step in planning a sample survey is to decide how to choose a sample \r\n[L156] from the population. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some good and not-so-good sam\ufffepling methods.\r\n[L157] How to Sample Badly\r\n[L158] How can we choose a sample that we can trust to represent the population? \r\n[L159] The easiest\u2014but not the best\u2014sampling method just chooses individuals who \r\n[L160] are close by. Suppose we\u2019re interested in finding out how long students at a \r\n[L161] large high school spent on homework last week, for example. We might go to \r\n[L162] the school library and ask the first 30 students we see about their homework \r\n[L163] time. A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\n[L164] easiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\n[L165] produce unrepresentative data.\r\n[L166] other economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\n[L167] specify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\n[L168] all U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\n[L169] not in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\n[L170] news refers to this specific population.\r\n[L171] What does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\n[L172] for example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\n[L173] she is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\n[L174] first asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\n[L175] work in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\n[L176] you are not in the labor force.\r\n[L177] If you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\n[L178] you did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\n[L179] you are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\n[L180] pay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\n[L181] because of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason. An unemployment rate \r\n[L182] of 9.7% means that 9.7% of the sample was unemployed, using the exact CPS \r\n[L183] definitions of both \u201clabor force\u201d and \u201cunemployed.\u201d\r\n[L184] DEFINITION: Convenience sample\r\n[L185] Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach results in a convenience sample.\r\n[L186] What\u2019s wrong with our convenience sample of students in the library? It\u2019s \r\n[L187] unlikely that this sample represents the homework habits of all students at the \r\n[L188] school well. In fact, we\u2019d expect the sample to overestimate the average homework \r\n[L189] time in the population since students who hang out in the library might tend to \r\n[L190] be more studious. This is bias: using a method that will consistently overestimate \r\n[L191] or underestimate the value you want to know.","[L192] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bea60ae105051c9#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_4.jpg","size_bytes":53957,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L193] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>","[L194] 210 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L195] EXAMPLE\r\n[L196] DEFINITION: Bias\r\n[L197] The design of a statistical study shows bias if it systematically favors certain outcomes.\r\n[L198] Convenience samples are almost guaranteed to show bias. So are voluntary \r\n[L199] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L200] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L201] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L202] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L203] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L204] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L205] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L206] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L207] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L208] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L209] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L210] to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\n[L211] Illegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\n[L212] Online polls\r\n[L213] Former CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\n[L214] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L215] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L216] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L217] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L218] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L219] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L220] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L221] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L222] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L223] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L224] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L225] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L226] the direction of the bias. Suppose you were asked, \u201cExplain how using a convenience sample of students in \r\n[L227] your statistics class to estimate the proportion of all high school students who own a graphing calculator could \r\n[L228] result in bias.\u201d You might respond, \u201cThis sample would probably include a much higher proportion of students \r\n[L229] with a graphing calculator than in the population at large because a graphing calculator is required for the \r\n[L230] statistics class.

In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L247] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L248] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L249] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L250] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L251] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L252] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L253] random sample.\r\n[L254] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L255] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L256] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L257] sample actually selected.\r\n[L258] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L259] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L260] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L261] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L262] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L263] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L264] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L265] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L266] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L267] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L268] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L269] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L270] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L271] if the population is large. Think about the \r\n[L272] Current Population Survey, for example, \r\n[L273] Random sampling","[L274] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://3a54b1107c99c35#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_6.jpg","size_bytes":57187,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L275] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>","[L276] 212 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L277] which must draw a sample of size 60,000 every month from the population of \r\n[L278] over 117 million U.S. households.\r\n[L279] In practice, people use random numbers generated by a computer or calcula\ufffetor to choose samples. If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L280] random digits.\r\n[L281] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L282] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L283] these properties:\r\n[L284] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L285] s The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\n[L286] gives no information about any other part.\r\n[L287] Table D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\n[L288] digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\n[L289] in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\n[L290] the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\n[L291] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L292] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L293] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L294] same length.\r\n[L295] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L296] from Table D.\r\n[L297] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L298] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L299] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L300] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L301] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L302] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L303] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L304] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L305] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L306] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L307] and so on\u2014because the table has no order.

Use the map shown to choose a sample of 5 states to \r\n[L382] estimate the average (mean) land area. You have \r\n[L383] 15 seconds.\r\n[L384] 2. Refer to the table of land areas on page N/DS-5.

What \r\n[L394] advantage(s) does random sampling provide?\r\n[L395] There\u2019s an important difference between the samples produced by the Simple\r\n[L396] Random Sample applet and the calculator\u2019s randInt command in the Technol\ufffeogy Corner. The applet sampled without replacement from the \u201cPopulation hop\ufffeper,\u201d but the calculator sampled with replacement from the specified population. \r\n[L397] As a result, the calculator sometimes selects the same number more than once in \r\n[L398] a given sample. To deal with this problem, you can generate additional random \r\n[L399] numbers as needed to replace any repeats. Or you can use a method other than \r\n[L400] randInt (like randSamp on the TI-Nspire) to sample without replacement. Refer \r\n[L401] to your device\u2019s reference manual or ask your teacher.\r\n[L402] We can trust results from an SRS, as well as from other types of random samples \r\n[L403] that we will meet later, because the use of impersonal chance avoids bias. Online\r\n[L404] and call-in polls also produce samples. But we can\u2019t trust results from these sam\ufffeples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. The first question to ask about \r\n[L405] any sample is whether it was chosen at random.\r\n[L406] Other Sampling Methods\r\n[L407] The basic idea of sampling is straightforward: take an SRS from the population \r\n[L408] and use your sample results to gain information about the population. Unfor\ufffetunately, it\u2019s usually very difficult to actually get an SRS from the population of \r\n[L409] interest. Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L410] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L411] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L412] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L413] selected. Sometimes, there are also statistical advantages to using more complex \r\n[L414] sampling methods.","[L415] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 11 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://10ecedd5bee1a96#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_10.jpg","size_bytes":60902,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L416] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 75>","[L417] 216 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L418] One of the most common alternatives to an SRS involves sampling important \r\n[L419] groups (called strata) within the population separately. Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L420] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L421] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L422] between strata.\r\n[L423] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L424] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L425] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L426] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L427] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L428] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L429] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L430] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L431] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size. Not convinced? Try \r\n[L432] the following Activity.\r\n[L433] ACTIVITY Sampling sunflowers\r\n[L434] A British farmer grows sunflowers for making sunflower oil. Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L435] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L436] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L437] money she\u2019ll make from selling them. It would take too much time to \r\n[L438] count the plants in all 100 squares, so she\u2019ll accept an estimate based on \r\n[L439] a sample of 10 squares.\r\n[L440] 1. Use Table D or technology to take a simple random sample of 10 \r\n[L441] grid squares. Record the location (for example, B6) of each square you \r\n[L442] select.\r\n[L443] 2. This time, you\u2019ll take a stratified random sample using the \r\n[L444] rows as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select \r\n[L445] one square from each (horizontal) row. Record the location of \r\n[L446] each square.\r\n[L447] 3. Now, take a stratified random sample using the columns\r\n[L448] as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select one \r\n[L449] square from each (vertical) column. Record the location of \r\n[L450] each square.\r\n[L451] 4. The table on page N/DS-6 gives the actual number of \r\n[L452] sunflowers in each grid square.

Your teacher will provide you with the mean number of sunflowers in the popu\ufffelation of all 100 grid squares in the field. How did the three sampling methods do?\r\n[L472] The following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\n[L473] in the music business.\r\n[L474] Who Wrote That Song?\r\n[L475] Using a stratified random sample\r\n[L476] A radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\n[L477] The organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\n[L478] members by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\n[L479] ASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\n[L480] year. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L481] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L482] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L483] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L484] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L485] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L486] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L487] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L488] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L489] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L490] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L491] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L492] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L493] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups. Ideally, these \r\n[L494] clusters should mirror the characteristics of the population. Then choose an SRS of the \r\n[L495] clusters. All individuals in the chosen clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L496] Imagine a large high school that assigns its students to homerooms alphabeti\ufffecally by last name. The school administration is considering a new schedule and \r\n[L497] would like student input. Administrators decide to survey 200 randomly selected \r\n[L498] students.

They don\u2019t offer the statistical advantage of better information about the \r\n[L507] population that stratified random samples do. That\u2019s because clusters are often \r\n[L508] chosen for ease or convenience, so they may have as much variability as the popu\ufffelation itself. Be sure you understand the difference between strata and clusters. \r\n[L509] We want each stratum to contain similar individuals, and for there to be large \r\n[L510] differences between strata. For a cluster sample, we\u2019d like each cluster to look just \r\n[L511] like the population, but on a smaller scale.\r\n[L512] Sampling at a School Assembly\r\n[L513] Strata or clusters?\r\n[L514] The student council wants to conduct a survey during the first \r\n[L515] five minutes of an all-school assembly in the auditorium about \r\n[L516] use of the school library.

Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L619] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L620] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L621] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L622] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L623] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L624] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L625] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L626] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L627] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L628] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L629] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L630] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L631] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L632] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L633] Sampling Units, or PSUs. Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\n[L634] the 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\n[L635] of the others.\r\n[L636] Stage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\n[L637] Stratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\n[L638] Stage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\n[L639] units. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\n[L640] Analyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\n[L641] beyond basic statistics.

The \r\n[L666] process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\n[L667] called inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\n[L668] we know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\n[L669] response samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\n[L670] the population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\n[L671] selecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\n[L672] Still, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\n[L673] the entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\n[L674] the monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\n[L675] population. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\n[L676] almost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\n[L677] Inference\r\n[L678] ACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\n[L679] MATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\n[L680] other container that students can\u2019t see through\r\n[L681] In this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\n[L682] in relation to the population truth.\r\n[L683] 1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\n[L684] particular color.\r\n[L685] 2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\n[L686] record the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\n[L687] returned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n[L688] 3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\n[L689] is the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\n[L690] center? Is there a clear shape?\r\n[L691] Why can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\n[L692] results of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\n[L693] Because we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\n[L694] govern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\n[L695] results are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\n[L696] random sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\n[L697] the population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\n[L698] sets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\n[L699] for sampling later.\r\n[L700] One point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples.

By taking a very large \r\n[L706] sample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\n[L707] about the population.\r\n[L708] The Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\n[L709] expect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\n[L710] of the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n[L711] 3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\n[L712] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L713] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L714] clicked a response.\r\n[L715] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L716] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L717] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L718] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L719] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L720] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L721] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L722] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L723] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L724] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L725] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L726] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L727] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L728] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L729] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L730] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L731] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L732] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L733] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L734] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L735] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L736] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L737] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L738] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L739] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L740] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L741] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L742] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L743] Sampling frame","[L744] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L745] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","[L746] 222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L747] EXAMPLE\r\n[L748] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L749] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L750] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L751] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L752] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L753] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L754] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L755] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L756] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L757] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L758] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L759] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L760] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L761] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L762] refuses to participate.\r\n[L763] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L764] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L765] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L766] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L767] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L768] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L769] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L770] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L771] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L772] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L773] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L774] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L775] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L776] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L777] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L778] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L779] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","[L780] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L781] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","[L782] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L783] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L784] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L785] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L786] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L787] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L788] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L789] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L790] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L791] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L792] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L793] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L794] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L795] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L796] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L797] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L798] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L799] memory. \u201cHave you visited a dentist in the last 6 months?\u201d will often draw a \r\n[L800] \u201cYes\u201d from someone who last visited a dentist 8 months ago.10 Careful training \r\n[L801] of interviewers and careful supervision to avoid variation among the interview\ufffeers can reduce response bias.

Confusing or leading questions can introduce strong bias, and \r\n[L809] changes in wording can greatly change a survey\u2019s outcome. Even the order in \r\n[L810] which questions are asked matters.\r\n[L811] How Do Americans Feel about Illegal Immigrants?\r\n[L812] Question wording matters\r\n[L813] \u201cShould illegal immigrants be prosecuted and deported for being in the U.S. illegally, \r\n[L814] or shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Asked this question in an opinion poll, 69% favored deportation. \r\n[L815] But when the very same sample was asked whether illegal immigrants who have \r\n[L816] worked in the United States for two years \u201cshould be given a chance to keep their jobs \r\n[L817] and eventually apply for legal status,\u201d 62% said that they should. Different questions \r\n[L818] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L819] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L820] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L821] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L822] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L823] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L824] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L825] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L826] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L827] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L828] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L829] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L830] 1.

A survey paid for by makers of disposable diapers found that 84% of the sample opposed \r\n[L836] banning disposable diapers.

In contrast, beverage containers, third-class mail and yard wastes are estimated\r\n[L839] to account for about 21% of the trash in landfills.

It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L853] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L854] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L855] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L856] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L857] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L858] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L859] process.\r\n[L860] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L861] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L862] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L863] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L864] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L865] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L866] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L867] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L868] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L869] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L870] prone to large bias.\r\n[L871] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L872] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L873] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L874] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L875] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L876] errors.

Sampling the forest To gather data on a 1200-acre \r\n[L1013] pine forest in Louisiana, the U.S. Forest Service laid a \r\n[L1014] grid of 1410 equally spaced circular plots over a map \r\n[L1015] of the forest. A ground survey visited a sample of 10% \r\n[L1016] of these plots.12\r\n[L1017] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table D \r\n[L1018] to choose an SRS of 141 plots. Your description should \r\n[L1019] be clear enough for a classmate to obtain your results.\r\n[L1020] (b) Use your method from (a) to choose the first \r\n[L1021] 3 plots.\r\n[L1022] 14. Sampling gravestones The local genealogical society \r\n[L1023] in Coles County, Illinois, has compiled records on all \r\n[L1024] 55,914 gravestones in cemeteries in the county for the \r\n[L1025] years 1825 to 1985. Historians plan to use these records \r\n[L1026] to learn about African Americans in Coles County\u2019s his\ufffetory. They first choose an SRS of 395 records to check \r\n[L1027] their accuracy by visiting the actual gravestones.13\r\n[L1028] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table \r\n[L1029] D to choose the SRS. Your description should be \r\n[L1030] clear enough for a classmate to obtain your results.\r\n[L1031] (b) Use your method from (a) to choose the first \r\n[L1032] 3 gravestones.\r\n[L1033] 15. Random digits In using Table D repeatedly to \r\n[L1034] choose random samples, you should not always begin \r\n[L1035] at the same place, such as line 101. Why not?\r\n[L1036] 16. Random digits Which of the following statements \r\n[L1037] are true of a table of random digits, and which are \r\n[L1038] false? Briefly explain your answers.\r\n[L1039] (a) There are exactly four 0s in each row of 40 digits.\r\n[L1040] (b) Each pair of digits has chance 1/100 of being 00.\r\n[L1041] (c) The digits 0000 can never appear as a group, \r\n[L1042] because this pattern is not random.\r\n[L1043] 17. iPhones Suppose 1000 iPhones are produced at a \r\n[L1044] factory today. Management would like to ensure \r\n[L1045] that the phones\u2019 display screens meet their quality \r\n[L1046] standards before shipping them to retail stores. Since \r\n[L1047] it takes about 10 minutes to inspect an individual \r\n[L1048] phone\u2019s display screen, managers decide to inspect a \r\n[L1049] sample of 20 phones from the day\u2019s production.\r\n[L1050] (a) Explain why it would be difficult for managers to \r\n[L1051] inspect an SRS of 20 iPhones that are produced today.\r\n[L1052] (b) An eager employee suggests that it would be easy \r\n[L1053] to inspect the last 20 iPhones that were produced \r\n[L1054] today. Why isn\u2019t this a good idea?\r\n[L1055] (c) Another employee recommends inspecting every \r\n[L1056] fiftieth iPhone that is produced. Explain carefully \r\n[L1057] why this sampling method is not an SRS.\r\n[L1058] 18. Dead trees On the west side of Rocky Mountain \r\n[L1059] National Park, many mature pine trees are dying due \r\n[L1060] to infestation by pine beetles. Scientists would like to \r\n[L1061] use sampling to estimate the proportion of all pine \r\n[L1062] trees in the area that have been infected.\r\n[L1063] (a) Explain why it wouldn\u2019t be practical for scientists \r\n[L1064] to obtain an SRS in this setting.\r\n[L1065] (b) A possible alternative would be to use every pine \r\n[L1066] tree along the park\u2019s main road as a sample. Why is \r\n[L1067] this sampling method biased?\r\n[L1068] (c) Suppose that a more complicated random sam\ufffepling plan is carried out, and that 35% of the pine trees \r\n[L1069] in the sample are infested by the pine beetle. Can \r\n[L1070] scientists conclude that 35% of all the pine trees on the \r\n[L1071] west side of the park are infested? Why or why not?\r\n[L1072] 19. Who goes to the convention? A club has 30 student \r\n[L1073] members and 10 faculty members. The students are\r\n[L1074] Abel Fisher Huber Miranda Reinmann\r\n[L1075] Carson Ghosh Jimenez Moskowitz Santos\r\n[L1076] Chen Griswold Jones Neyman Shaw\r\n[L1077] David Hein Kim O\u2019Brien Thompson\r\n[L1078] Deming Hernandez Klotz Pearl Utts\r\n[L1079] Elashoff Holland Liu Potter Varga\r\n[L1080] The faculty members are\r\n[L1081] Andrews Fernandez Kim Moore West\r\n[L1082] Besicovitch Gupta Lightman Phillips Yang","[L1083] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>","[L1084] 228 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1085] The club can send 4 students and 2 faculty members \r\n[L1086] to a convention. It decides to choose those who will \r\n[L1087] go by random selection. How will you label the two \r\n[L1088] strata? Use Table D, beginning at line 123, to choose \r\n[L1089] a stratified random sample of 4 students and 2 faculty \r\n[L1090] members.\r\n[L1091] 20. Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\n[L1092] stratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\n[L1093] records of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\n[L1094] stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\n[L1095] and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\n[L1096] One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\n[L1097] these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\n[L1098] amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000. Using these \r\n[L1099] groups as strata, you decide to verify all the largest \r\n[L1100] accounts and to sample 5% of the midsize accounts \r\n[L1101] and 1% of the small accounts. How would you label \r\n[L1102] the two strata from which you will sample? Use Table \r\n[L1103] D, starting at line 115, to select only the first 3 \r\n[L1104] accounts from each of these strata.\r\n[L1105] 21. Go Blue! Michigan Stadium, also known as \u201cThe Big \r\n[L1106] House,\u201d seats over 100,000 fans for a football game. \r\n[L1107] The University of Michigan athletic department plans \r\n[L1108] to conduct a survey about concessions that are sold \r\n[L1109] during games. Tickets are most expensive for seats \r\n[L1110] near the field and on the sideline. The cheapest seats \r\n[L1111] are high up in the end zones (where one of the au\ufffethors sat as a student). A map of the stadium is shown.\r\n[L1112] Visitor Sideline\r\n[L1113] Michigan Sideline\r\n[L1114] Sideline PRESS BOX ENDZONE\r\n[L1115] ENDZONE\r\n[L1116] 41 42 40\r\n[L1117] 39\r\n[L1118] 43 44 1 2 3 4 5 6\r\n[L1119] 7\r\n[L1120] 27 26 28\r\n[L1121] 29\r\n[L1122] 25\r\n[L1123] 35\r\n[L1124] 34\r\n[L1125] 33\r\n[L1126] 32\r\n[L1127] 31\r\n[L1128] 30\r\n[L1129] 36\r\n[L1130] 37\r\n[L1131] 38\r\n[L1132] 11\r\n[L1133] 12\r\n[L1134] 13\r\n[L1135] 14\r\n[L1136] 15\r\n[L1137] 16\r\n[L1138] 10\r\n[L1139] 9\r\n[L1140] 8\r\n[L1141] 24 23 22 21 20 19 18\r\n[L1142] 17\r\n[L1143] Corner\r\n[L1144] Endzone\r\n[L1145] (a) The athletic department is considering a stratified \r\n[L1146] random sample. What would you recommend as the \r\n[L1147] strata? Why?\r\n[L1148] (b) Explain why a cluster sample might be easier to \r\n[L1149] obtain. What would you recommend for the clusters? \r\n[L1150] Why?\r\n[L1151] 22. How was your stay? A hotel has 30 floors with 40 \r\n[L1152] rooms per floor. The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L1153] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L1154] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L1155] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L1156] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L1157] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L1158] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L1159] might be preferable to an SRS in this case. What \r\n[L1160] would you use as strata?\r\n[L1161] (b) Why might a cluster sample be a simpler option? \r\n[L1162] What would you use as clusters?\r\n[L1163] 23. Is it an SRS? A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L1164] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L1165] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L1166] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L1167] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L1168] Explain your answer.\r\n[L1169] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L1170] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L1171] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L1172] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L1173] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L1174] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L1175] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L1176] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L1177] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L1178] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L1179] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L1180] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L1181] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L1182] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L1183] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L1184] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L1185] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L1186] method?\r\n[L1187] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L1188] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L1189] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L1190] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L1191] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L1192] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L1193] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L1194] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1195] sample.\r\n[L1196] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L1197] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L1198] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L1199] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L1200] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L1201] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L1202] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L1203] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L1204] pg 218","[L1205] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1206] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","[L1207] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L1208] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1209] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200. Enter the \r\n[L1210] table at line 120.\r\n[L1211] (b) Like an SRS, a systematic random sample gives \r\n[L1212] all individuals the same chance to be chosen. Explain \r\n[L1213] why this is true. Then explain carefully why a system\ufffeatic sample is not an SRS.\r\n[L1214] 27. Sampling frame Ideally, the sampling frame in a \r\n[L1215] sample survey should list every individual in the \r\n[L1216] population, but in practice, this is often difficult. \r\n[L1217] Suppose that a sample of households in a community \r\n[L1218] is selected at random from the telephone directory. \r\n[L1219] Explain how this sampling method results in under\ufffecoverage that could lead to bias.\r\n[L1220] 28. Sampling frame Refer to the previous exercise. It is \r\n[L1221] more common in telephone surveys to use random \r\n[L1222] digit dialing equipment that selects the last four digits \r\n[L1223] of a telephone number at random after being given \r\n[L1224] the exchange (the first three digits). Explain how this \r\n[L1225] sampling method results in undercoverage that could \r\n[L1226] lead to bias.\r\n[L1227] 29. Baseball tickets Suppose you want to know the \r\n[L1228] average amount of money spent by the fans attending \r\n[L1229] opening day for the Cleveland Indians baseball sea\ufffeson. You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\n[L1230] to conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\n[L1231] allow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\n[L1232] seats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\n[L1233] you randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\n[L1234] stadium. During the game, you ask the fans in those \r\n[L1235] seats how much they spent that day.\r\n[L1236] (a) Provide a reason why this survey might yield a \r\n[L1237] biased result.\r\n[L1238] (b) Explain whether the reason you provided in (a) is \r\n[L1239] a sampling error or a nonsampling error.\r\n[L1240] 30. What kind of error? Which of the following are \r\n[L1241] sources of sampling error and which are sources of \r\n[L1242] nonsampling error? Explain your answers.\r\n[L1243] (a) The subject lies about past drug use.\r\n[L1244] (b) A typing error is made in recording the data.\r\n[L1245] (c) Data are gathered by asking people to mail in a \r\n[L1246] coupon printed in a newspaper.\r\n[L1247] 31. Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\n[L1248] sampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\n[L1249] the United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n[L1250] 5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\n[L1251] estimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n[L1252] (a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n[L1253] (b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\n[L1254] survey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n[L1255] 32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\n[L1256] in telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\n[L1257] call is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\n[L1258] The Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\n[L1259] nonresponse to a government survey of households \r\n[L1260] in Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\n[L1261] July 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\n[L1262] and 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\n[L1263] period versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\n[L1264] period.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\n[L1265] rate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\n[L1266] nonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n[L1267] 33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n[L1268] 31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\n[L1269] answer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\n[L1270] drove through, how many of them were red when you \r\n[L1271] entered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n[L1272] 171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\n[L1273] practical problem with this survey is that people may \r\n[L1274] not give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\n[L1275] of the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n[L1276] 880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n[L1277] 34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\n[L1278] belt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\n[L1279] chosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\n[L1280] they were invited to answer questions that included \r\n[L1281] questions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\n[L1282] always used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\n[L1283] seat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\n[L1284] lots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey. Do you expect bias in the same \r\n[L1285] direction in most surveys about seat belt use?\r\n[L1286] 35. Wording bias Comment on each of the following \r\n[L1287] as a potential sample survey question. Is the question \r\n[L1288] clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1289] (a) \u201cSome cell phone users have developed brain \r\n[L1290] cancer. Should all cell phones come with a warning \r\n[L1291] label explaining the danger of using cell phones?\u201d\r\n[L1292] (b) \u201cDo you agree that a national system of health \r\n[L1293] insurance should be favored because it would provide \r\n[L1294] health insurance for everyone and would reduce \r\n[L1295] administrative costs?\u201d\r\n[L1296] (c) \u201cIn view of escalating environmental degradation \r\n[L1297] and incipient resource depletion, would you favor \r\n[L1298] economic incentives for recycling of resource\ufffeintensive consumer goods?\u201d\r\n[L1299] 36. Checking for bias Comment on each of the fol\ufffelowing as a potential sample survey question. Is the \r\n[L1300] question clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1301] (a) Which of the following best represents your \r\n[L1302] opinion on gun control?\r\n[L1303] 1.

Sample surveys are one kind of observational\r\n[L1406] study. Other observational studies watch the behavior of animals in the wild or the \r\n[L1407] interactions between teacher and students in the classroom. This section is about \r\n[L1408] statistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\n[L1409] Observational Study versus Experiment\r\n[L1410] In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\n[L1411] ask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\n[L1412] response. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\n[L1413] of a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\n[L1414] DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\n[L1415] An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\n[L1416] does not attempt to influence the responses.\r\n[L1417] An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\n[L1418] responses.\r\n[L1419] The goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\n[L1420] to compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\n[L1421] of an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\n[L1422] response. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\n[L1423] way to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\n[L1424] see the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\n[L1425] is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\n[L1426] data. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\n[L1427] is one of the most important in statistics.\r\n[L1428] Does Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\n[L1429] after Menopause?\r\n[L1430] Observation versus experiment\r\n[L1431] Should women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\n[L1432] production of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\n[L1433] a heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\n[L1434] small compared with the benefits.\r\n[L1435] The evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\n[L1436] hormones with others who were not. But the women who chose to \r\n[L1437] take hormones were richer and better educated and saw doctors \r\n[L1438] more often than women who didn\u2019t take hormones.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L1466] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L1467] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L1468] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L1469] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L1470] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L1471] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L1472] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L1473] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L1474] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L1475] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L1476] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L1477] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L1478] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L1479] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L1480] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L1481] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L1482] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L1483] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L1484] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L1485] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L1486] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L1487] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L1488] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L1489] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L1490] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L1491] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L1492] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L1493] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L1494] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L1495] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L1496] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L1497] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","[L1498] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1499] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","[L1500] Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L1501] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L1502] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L1503] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L1504] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L1505] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L1506] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L1507] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L1508] results of the earlier observational studies.

Here is the basic vocabulary of experiments.\r\n[L1526] DEFINITION: Treatment, experimental units, subjects\r\n[L1527] A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment.\r\n[L1528] If an experiment has several explanatory variables, a treatment is a combination of \r\n[L1529] specific values of these variables.\r\n[L1530] The experimental units are the smallest collection of individuals to which treatments \r\n[L1531] are applied. When the units are human beings, they often are called subjects.\r\n[L1532] The best way to learn the language of experiments is to practice using it.\r\n[L1533] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1534] are asked to identify a \r\n[L1535] possible confounding \r\n[L1536] variable in a given \r\n[L1537] setting, you are \r\n[L1538] expected to explain how \r\n[L1539] the variable you choose \r\n[L1540] (1) is associated with \r\n[L1541] the explanatory variable \r\n[L1542] and (2) affects the \r\n[L1543] response variable.","[L1544] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1545] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>","[L1546] 234 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1547] EXAMPLE When Will I Ever Use This Stuff?\r\n[L1548] Vocabulary of experiments\r\n[L1549] Researchers at the University of North Carolina were concerned about the \r\n[L1550] increasing dropout rate in the state\u2019s high schools, especially for low-income stu\ufffedents. Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\n[L1551] started to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\n[L1552] To change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\n[L1553] the topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\n[L1554] To test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\n[L1555] the schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\n[L1556] standard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\n[L1557] curriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\n[L1558] years, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\n[L1559] scores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\n[L1560] high school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\n[L1561] greater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\n[L1562] PROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\n[L1563] in the CareerStart experiment.\r\n[L1564] SOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\n[L1565] variable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\n[L1566] compares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\n[L1567] behavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\n[L1568] The previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\n[L1569] trying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\n[L1570] all 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\n[L1571] of schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\n[L1572] researchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\n[L1573] systematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\n[L1574] students from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\n[L1575] program made the difference.\r\n[L1576] Sometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\n[L1577] experiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\n[L1578] treatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\n[L1579] the factors. Here\u2019s an example of a multifactor experiment.\r\n[L1580] Factors\r\n[L1581] Level\r\n[L1582] For Practice Try Exercise 51","[L1583] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://26b92d516ab78a7#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_29.jpg","size_bytes":63833,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1584] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>","[L1585] Section 4.2 Experiments 235\r\n[L1586] EXAMPLE TV Advertising\r\n[L1587] Experiments with multiple explanatory variables\r\n[L1588] What are the effects of repeated exposure to an advertising message? The answer \r\n[L1589] may depend on both the length of the ad and on how often it is repeat\ufffeed. An experiment investigated this question using undergraduate stu\ufffedents as subjects. All subjects viewed a 40-minute television program \r\n[L1590] that included ads for a digital camera. Some subjects saw a 30-second \r\n[L1591] commercial; others, a 90-second version. The same commercial was \r\n[L1592] shown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After viewing, all the \r\n[L1593] subjects answered questions about their recall of the ad, their attitude \r\n[L1594] toward the camera, and their intention to purchase it.21\r\n[L1595] PROBLEM: For the advertising study,\r\n[L1596] (a) identify the explanatory and response variables, and\r\n[L1597] (b) list all the treatments.\r\n[L1598] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1599] (a) This experiment has 2 explanatory variables (factors): \r\n[L1600] length of the commercial and number of repetitions. The response \r\n[L1601] variables include measures of subjects\u2019 recall of the ad, their \r\n[L1602] attitudes about the digital camera, and whether they intend to \r\n[L1603] purchase it.\r\n[L1604] (b) There are 2 different lengths of commercial (30 and 90 seconds) \r\n[L1605] and three different numbers of repetitions (1, 3, and 5). The 6 combi\ufffenations consisting of one level of each factor form the 6 treatments \r\n[L1606] shown in Figure 4.3: (1) 30 seconds, 1 time; (2) 30 seconds, 3 times; \r\n[L1607] (3) 30 seconds, 5 times; (4) 90 seconds, 1 time; (5) 90 seconds, \r\n[L1608] 3 times; (6) 90 seconds, 5 times.\r\n[L1609] This example shows how experiments allow us to study the combined effect of \r\n[L1610] several factors. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\n[L1611] not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\n[L1612] commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\n[L1613] interest. But if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers \r\n[L1614] get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. The two-factor experiment in \r\n[L1615] the TV advertising example will help us find out.\r\n[L1616] How to Experiment Badly \r\n[L1617] Experiments are the preferred method for examining the effect of one variable on \r\n[L1618] another. By imposing the specific treatment of interest and controlling other \r\n[L1619] influences, we can pin down cause and effect. Good designs are essential for \r\n[L1620] effective experiments, just as they are for sampling. To see why, let\u2019s start with an \r\n[L1621] example of a bad experimental design.\r\n[L1622] Factor A\r\n[L1623] Length\r\n[L1624] Factor B\r\n[L1625] Repetitions\r\n[L1626] 30\r\n[L1627] seconds 1 2 3\r\n[L1628] 90\r\n[L1629] seconds\r\n[L1630] 1 time 3 times 5 times\r\n[L1631] 4 5 6\r\n[L1632] Subjects assigned\r\n[L1633] to Treatment 3 see\r\n[L1634] a 30-second ad\r\n[L1635] five times during\r\n[L1636] the program.\r\n[L1637] For Practice Try Exercise 55\r\n[L1638] FIGURE 4.3 The six treatments in the TV ad experiment. \r\n[L1639] Combinations of values of the two explanatory variables \r\n[L1640] (factors) form six treatments.","[L1641] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bcf9a5dddba7c8b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":57574,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1642] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 75>","[L1643] 236 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1644] EXAMPLE Which Works Better: Online or In-Class \r\n[L1645] SAT Preparation?\r\n[L1646] A bad experiment\r\n[L1647] A high school regularly offers a review course to prepare students for \r\n[L1648] the SAT. This year, budget cuts will allow the school to offer only an \r\n[L1649] online version of the course. Over the past 10 years, the average SAT \r\n[L1650] score of students in the classroom course was 1620. The online group \r\n[L1651] gets an average score of 1780. That\u2019s roughly 10% higher than the long\ufffetime average for those who took the classroom review course. Is the \r\n[L1652] online course more effective?\r\n[L1653] This experiment has a very simple design. A group of subjects (the \r\n[L1654] students) were exposed to a treatment (the online course), and the \r\n[L1655] outcome (SAT scores) was observed. Here is the design:\r\n[L1656] Students \u2192 Online course \u2192 SAT scores\r\n[L1657] A closer look showed that the students in the online review course \r\n[L1658] were quite different from the students who took the classroom course \r\n[L1659] in past years. They had higher GPAs and were taking more AP classes.\r\n[L1660] The effect of online versus in-class instruction is mixed up with the \r\n[L1661] effect of these lurking variables. Maybe the online students earned \r\n[L1662] higher SAT scores because they were smarter to begin with, not \r\n[L1663] because the online course prepared them better. This confounding \r\n[L1664] prevents us from concluding that the online course is more effective than class\uffferoom instruction.\r\n[L1665] Many laboratory experiments use a design like the one in the online SAT course \r\n[L1666] example:\r\n[L1667] Experimental units \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Measure response\r\n[L1668] In the lab environment, simple designs often work well. Field experiments and \r\n[L1669] experiments with animals or people deal with more variable conditions.

Most well-designed experiments compare \r\n[L1675] two or more treatments.\r\n[L1676] Comparison alone isn\u2019t enough to produce results we can trust. If the treat\ufffements are given to groups that differ greatly when the experiment begins, bias will \r\n[L1677] result.

The solution to the problem of bias in sampling is \r\n[L1684] random selection. In experiments, the solution is random assignment.\r\n[L1685] DEFINITION: Random assignment\r\n[L1686] In an experiment, random assignment means that experimental units are assigned to \r\n[L1687] treatments at random, that is, using some sort of chance process.\r\n[L1688] Let\u2019s look at how random assignment can be used to improve the design of the \r\n[L1689] SAT prep course experiment.\r\n[L1690] SAT Prep: Online versus Classroom\r\n[L1691] How random assignment works\r\n[L1692] This year, the high school has enough budget money to compare the \r\n[L1693] online SAT course with traditional classroom instruction. Fifty students \r\n[L1694] have agreed to participate in an experiment comparing the two instruc\ufffetional methods.\r\n[L1695] PROBLEM: Describe how you would randomly assign 25 students to each of the two \r\n[L1696] methods:\r\n[L1697] (a) Using 50 identical slips of paper\r\n[L1698] (b) Using Table D\r\n[L1699] (c) Using technology\r\n[L1700] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1701] (a) The simplest way would be to use the \u201chat method.\u201d Write each subject\u2019s name on \r\n[L1702] one of the slips. Put all the slips in a hat and mix them thoroughly. Draw them out one \r\n[L1703] at a time until you have 25 slips. These 25 students will take the online course. The \r\n[L1704] remaining 25 students will take the classroom course. Alternatively, you could write \r\n[L1705] \u201conline\u201d on 25 of the slips and \u201cclassroom\u201d on the other 25 slips. Then put the slips in \r\n[L1706] a hat and mix them well. Have students come up one by one and (without looking) pick a slip from the \r\n[L1707] hat. This guarantees 25 students per group, with the treatments assigned by chance.\r\n[L1708] (b) We can use the two-step process from random sampling to do the random assignment.\r\n[L1709] Step 1: Label. Give labels 01, 02, 03, . . . , 49, 50 to the subjects in alphabetical order by last \r\n[L1710] name.\r\n[L1711] Step 2: Table. Go to a line of Table D and read two-digit groups moving from left to right. The first \r\n[L1712] 25 distinct labels between 01 and 50 that you encounter select the online group. The remaining \r\n[L1713] 25\u00a0students will take the classroom course. Ignore repeated labels and groups of digits from \r\n[L1714] 51 to\u00a000.\r\n[L1715] (c) Give numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , 49, 50 to the subjects in alphabetical order by last name. Then use \r\n[L1716] your calculator\u2019s randInt command or a computer\u2019s random number generator to produce numbers \r\n[L1717] between 1 and 50.

It is randomized because the sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments by chance. The diagram in Figure 4.4 presents \r\n[L1725] the details: random assignment, the sizes of the groups and which treatment they \r\n[L1726] receive, and the response variable. There are, as we will see later, statistical rea\ufffesons for using treatment groups that are about equal in size. This type of design is \r\n[L1727] called a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1728] 50 volunteer\r\n[L1729] students\r\n[L1730] Random\r\n[L1731] assignment\r\n[L1732] Group 1\r\n[L1733] 25 students\r\n[L1734] Group 2\r\n[L1735] 25 students\r\n[L1736] Compare\r\n[L1737] SAT scores\r\n[L1738] Treatment 2\r\n[L1739] Classroom\r\n[L1740] Treatment 1\r\n[L1741] Online\r\n[L1742] FIGURE 4.4 Outline of a completely randomized design to compare online and classroom \r\n[L1743] instruction.\r\n[L1744] DEFINITION: Completely randomized design\r\n[L1745] In a completely randomized design, the treatments are assigned to all the experimen\ufffetal units completely by chance.\r\n[L1746] Notice that the definition of a completely randomized design does not require \r\n[L1747] that each treatment be assigned to an equal number of experimental units. It does \r\n[L1748] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L1749] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L1750] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L1751] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L1752] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L1753] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L1754] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1755] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L1756] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L1757] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L1758] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L1759] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L1760] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L1761] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L1762] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L1763] than it really is.\r\n[L1764] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments.

An electric company considers placing small \r\n[L1776] digital displays in households to show current electricity use and what the cost \r\n[L1777] would be if this use continued for a month. Will the displays reduce electricity \r\n[L1778] use? One cheaper approach is to give customers a chart and information about \r\n[L1779] monitoring their electricity use from their outside meter. Would this method \r\n[L1780] work almost as well? The company decides to conduct an experiment to com\ufffepare these two approaches (display, chart) with a control group of customers \r\n[L1781] who receive information about energy consumption but no help in monitoring \r\n[L1782] electricity use.\r\n[L1783] PROBLEM: Outline a completely randomized design involving 60 single-family residences in the \r\n[L1784] same city who are willing to participate in such an experiment.

You might be thinking that the change \r\n[L1843] in electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\n[L1844] would tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\n[L1845] Suppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\n[L1846] households might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\n[L1847] whether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\n[L1848] confounding?!)\r\n[L1849] Many experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\n[L1850] group that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\n[L1851] an active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\n[L1852] developed drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\n[L1853] work. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\n[L1854] control group.\r\n[L1855] Some experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group. That\u2019s appropriate \r\n[L1856] if researchers simply want to compare the effects of several treatments, and not \r\n[L1857] to determine whether any of them works better than an inactive treatment. For \r\n[L1858] instance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\n[L1859] of paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\n[L1860] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L1861] Music students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately.

Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L1863] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L1864] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L1865] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L1866] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L1867] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment.

Provide enough detail that \r\n[L1870] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L1871] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L1872] Three Principles of \r\n[L1873] Experimental Design\r\n[L1874] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L1875] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L1876] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L1877] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L1878] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1879] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L1880] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L1881] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L1882] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1883] ?\r\n[L1884] THINK\r\n[L1885] ABOUT\r\n[L1886] IT","[L1887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","[L1888] Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L1889] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1890] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L1891] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L1892] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L1893] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L1894] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L1895] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L1896] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L1897] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L1898] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L1899] between the groups.\r\n[L1900] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L1901] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L1902] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L1903] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L1904] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L1905] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L1906] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L1907] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L1908] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L1909] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L1910] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L1911] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L1912] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L1913] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L1914] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L1915] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L1916] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L1917] experiment.\r\n[L1918] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L1919] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L1920] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks?

Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\n[L1922] help prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\n[L1923] male physicians.

There were several response \r\n[L1934] variables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\n[L1935] other medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\n[L1936] only 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\n[L1937] large enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\n[L1938] attacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\n[L1939] preventing cancer.\r\n[L1940] PROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\n[L1941] design was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\n[L1942] SOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\n[L1943] lurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\n[L1944] treatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\n[L1945] schedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\n[L1946] which subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\n[L1947] helped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\n[L1948] begin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\n[L1949] replication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\n[L1950] the groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\n[L1951] the random assignment.\r\n[L1952] The control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n[L1953] (placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\n[L1954] Experiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L1955] The logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\n[L1956] all the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\n[L1957] that all subjects really are treated identically.\r\n[L1958] If some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\n[L1959] group takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\n[L1960] the subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\n[L1961] experiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\n[L1962] On even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo. Many patients respond favorably to any treatment, even a placebo, perhaps \r\n[L1963] because they trust the doctor. The response to a dummy treatment is called the \r\n[L1964] Placebo\r\n[L1965] Factor 1:\r\n[L1966] Aspirin\r\n[L1967] Factor 2: Beta-carotene\r\n[L1968] Yes\r\n[L1969] Yes No\r\n[L1970] Aspirin Beta-carotene Aspirin Placebo\r\n[L1971] No\r\n[L1972] Placebo Beta-carotene Placebo Placebo\r\n[L1973] FIGURE 4.6 The treatments in the \r\n[L1974] Physicians\u2019 Health Study.","[L1975] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b06f1b5c1816f6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_37.jpg","size_bytes":61000,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1976] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>","[L1977] Section 4.2 Experiments 243\r\n[L1978] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1979] placebo effect. If some subjects did not take any pills, the effect of aspirin or \r\n[L1980] beta-carotene would be confounded with the placebo effect, the effect of simply \r\n[L1981] taking pills.\r\n[L1982] Curing Baldness and Soothing Pain\r\n[L1983] Do placebos work?\r\n[L1984] Want to help balding men keep their hair? Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\n[L1985] that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\n[L1986] heads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n[L1987] 24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\n[L1988] active medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\n[L1989] the pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\n[L1990] significantly less pain.24\r\n[L1991] When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\n[L1992] that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\n[L1993] placebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\n[L1994] treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\n[L1995] enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\n[L1996] place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\n[L1997] The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\n[L1998] their hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\n[L1999] beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\n[L2000] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L2001] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L2002] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L2003] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L2004] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L2005] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L2006] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L2007] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L2008] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L2009] Placebo effect","[L2010] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2011] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>","[L2012] 244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2013] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L2014] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L2015] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L2016] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L2017] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L2018] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L2019] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L2020] the response variable do know.\r\n[L2021] Single-blind\r\n[L2022] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L2023] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L2024] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L2025] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L2026] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L2027] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L2028] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L2029] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\n[L2030] received the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n[L2031] 1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n[L2032] 2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n[L2033] 3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L2034] experiment.\r\n[L2035] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L2036] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L2037] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L2038] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L2039] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L2040] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L2041] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L2042] significant.\r\n[L2043] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L2044] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L2045] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L2046] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L2047] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation. A statistically sig\ufffenificant association in data from a well-designed experiment does imply causation.","[L2048] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b86211c359fd2c0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_39.jpg","size_bytes":53857,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2049] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 41 / 75>","[L2050] Section 4.2 Experiments 245\r\n[L2051] ACTIVITY Distracted driving\r\n[L2052] MATERIALS: Deck of cards for each team of 3 to 4 students\r\n[L2053] Is talking on a cell phone while driving more distracting than talking to \r\n[L2054] a passenger? David Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah \r\n[L2055] designed an experiment to help answer this question. They used 48 un\ufffedergraduate students as subjects. The researchers randomly assigned half \r\n[L2056] of the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\n[L2057] the other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger. One \r\n[L2058] response variable was whether the driver stopped at a rest area that was \r\n[L2059] specified by researchers before the simulation started.

We need 48 cards from the deck to represent the drivers in this study. In the \r\n[L2069] original experiment, 33 drivers stopped at the rest area and 15 didn\u2019t. Since \r\n[L2070] we\u2019re assuming that the treatment received won\u2019t change whether each driver \r\n[L2071] stops at the rest area, we use 33 cards to represent drivers who stop and 15 cards \r\n[L2072] to represent those who don\u2019t.

Let\u2019s return \r\n[L2104] to the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\n[L2105] one group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L2106] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L2107] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L2108] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L2109] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L2110] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L2111] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L2112] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L2113] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L2114] response to the treatments.\r\n[L2115] Blocking\r\n[L2116] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L2117] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L2118] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L2119] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L2120] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

They decide to \r\n[L2130] perform an experiment using numerous pieces of dirty laundry \r\n[L2131] as the experimental units. The response variable is a cleanli\ufffeness rating on a scale of 0 (very dirty) to 10 (very clean). How \r\n[L2132] should researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water? They could \r\n[L2133] use a completely randomized design and hope that the \r\n[L2134] random assignment distributes the light-colored clothing \r\n[L2135] about evenly between the cold- and warm-water treatment \r\n[L2136] groups.

For example, if an ad appealed \r\n[L2221] 300\r\n[L2222] volunteer\r\n[L2223] subjects\r\n[L2224] Women\r\n[L2225] n  120\r\n[L2226] Random\r\n[L2227] assignment\r\n[L2228] Group 1\r\n[L2229] n  40\r\n[L2230] Group 3\r\n[L2231] n  40\r\n[L2232] Compare\r\n[L2233] reaction\r\n[L2234] Group 2\r\n[L2235] n  40\r\n[L2236] Ad 1\r\n[L2237] Ad 2\r\n[L2238] Ad 3\r\n[L2239] Men\r\n[L2240] n  180\r\n[L2241] Random\r\n[L2242] assignment\r\n[L2243] Group 1\r\n[L2244] n  60\r\n[L2245] Group 3\r\n[L2246] n  60\r\n[L2247] Compare\r\n[L2248] reaction\r\n[L2249] Group 2\r\n[L2250] n  60\r\n[L2251] Ad 1\r\n[L2252] Ad 2\r\n[L2253] Ad 3\r\n[L2254] FIGURE 4.8 Randomized block design for comparing responses to three advertisements.

The idea is to create blocks by matching pairs of similar \r\n[L2262] experimental units. Then we can use chance to decide which member of a pair \r\n[L2263] gets the first treatment. The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L2264] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L2265] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L2266] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L2267] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L2268] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L2269] Matched pairs design\r\n[L2270] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L2271] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L2272] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L2273] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L2274] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L2275] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L2276] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L2277] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L2278] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L2279] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L2280] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L2281] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L2282] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L2283] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L2284] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L2285] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates? In this Activity, \r\n[L2286] you will perform two experiments to try to answer this question.\r\n[L2287] 1. Completely randomized design For the first experiment, you\u2019ll randomly \r\n[L2288] assign half of the students in your class to stand and the other half to sit. You can \r\n[L2289] use the hat method, Table D, or technology to carry out the random assignment. \r\n[L2290] Once the two treatment groups have been formed, students should stand or sit \r\n[L2291] as required. Then they should measure their pulses for one minute. Have the \r\n[L2292] subjects in each group record their data on the board.\r\n[L2293] 2. Matched pairs design In a matched pairs design, each student should receive \r\n[L2294] both treatments in a random order. Since you already sat or stood in Step 1, \r\n[L2295] you just need to do the opposite now. As before, everyone should measure their \r\n[L2296] pulses for one minute after completing the treatment (that is, once they are \r\n[L2297] standing or sitting). Have all the subjects record their data (both measurements) \r\n[L2298] in a chart on the board.","[L2299] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 45 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d19bf42557d3861#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_44.jpg","size_bytes":57481,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2300] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>","[L2301] 250 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2302] 3. Analyze the data for the completely randomized design. Make a dotplot and \r\n[L2303] calculate the mean pulse rate for each group. Is there evidence that standing \r\n[L2304] pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2305] 4. Analyze the data for the matched pairs design. Since the data are paired \r\n[L2306] by student, your first step should be to calculate the difference in pulse rate \r\n[L2307] (standing \u2013 sitting) for each subject. Make a dotplot of these differences and cal\ufffeculate their mean. Is there evidence that standing pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2308] 5. What advantage does the matched pairs design have over the completely \r\n[L2309] randomized design?\r\n[L2310] An AP Statistics class with 24 students performed the \u201cGet Your Heart Beating\u201d \r\n[L2311] Activity. We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\n[L2312] EXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\n[L2313] Design determines analysis\r\n[L2314] A Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\n[L2315] randomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\n[L2316] standing group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n[L2317] 68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\n[L2318] higher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\n[L2319] pulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\n[L2320] graph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\n[L2321] standing pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\n[L2322] What about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\n[L2323] Fathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\n[L2324] rates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\n[L2325] difference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n[L2326] 24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\n[L2327] standing pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\n[L2328] evidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\n[L2329] Let\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\n[L2330] that we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\n[L2331] experimental designs. Blocking by subject in the matched pairs design greatly \r\n[L2332] reduced the variability in the response variable. That made it easier to detect \r\n[L2333] the fact that standing causes an increase in pulse rate. With the large amount \r\n[L2334] of variability in the completely randomized design, we were unable to draw \r\n[L2335] such a conclusion.","[L2336] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5c9678406de9a79#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_45.jpg","size_bytes":52515,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2337] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 47 / 75>","[L2338] Section 4.2 Experiments 251\r\n[L2339] Another important lesson to take away from the example is this: the design of the \r\n[L2340] study determines the appropriate method of analysis. For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\n[L2341] dotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\n[L2342] compare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\n[L2343] The following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\n[L2344] analyzing data from an experiment.\r\n[L2345] DATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\n[L2346] Most automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n[L2347] 78% nitrogen. Aircraft tires are filled with pure nitrogen, which is safer than air \r\n[L2348] in case of fire. Could filling automobile tires with nitrogen improve safety, perfor\ufffemance, or both?\r\n[L2349] Consumers Union designed a study to test whether nitrogen-filled tires would \r\n[L2350] maintain pressure better than air-filled tires. They obtained two tires from each of \r\n[L2351] several brands and then filled one tire in each pair with air and one with nitrogen. \r\n[L2352] All tires were inflated to a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch and then placed \r\n[L2353] outside for a year. At the end of the year, Consumers Union measured the pres\ufffesure in each tire. The amount of pressure lost (in pounds per square inch) during \r\n[L2354] the year for the air-filled and nitrogen-filled tires of each brand is shown in the \r\n[L2355] table below.29\r\n[L2356] Brand Air Nitrogen Brand Air Nitrogen\r\n[L2357] BF Goodrich Traction T/A HR 7.6 7.2 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 4.4 4.2\r\n[L2358] Bridgestone HP50 (Sears) 3.8 2.5 Sumitomo HTR H4 1.4 2.1\r\n[L2359] Bridgestone Potenza G009 3.7 1.6 Yokohama Avid H4S 4.3 3.0\r\n[L2360] Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.7 1.5 BF Goodrich Traction T/A V 5.5 3.4\r\n[L2361] Bridgestone Potenza EL400 2.1 1.0 Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.1 2.8\r\n[L2362] Continental Premier Contact H 4.9 3.1 Continental ContiExtreme Contact 5.0 3.4\r\n[L2363] Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 5.2 3.5 Continental ContiProContact 4.8 3.3\r\n[L2364] Dayton Daytona HR 3.4 3.2 Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 3.2 2.5\r\n[L2365] Falken Ziex ZE-512 4.1 3.3 General Exclaim UHP 6.8 2.7\r\n[L2366] Fuzion Hrl 2.7 2.2 Hankook Ventus V4 H105 3.1 1.4\r\n[L2367] General Exclaim 3.1 3.4 Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.5 1.5\r\n[L2368] Goodyear Assurance Tripletred 3.8 3.2 Michelin Pilot Exalto A/S 6.6 2.2\r\n[L2369] Hankook Optimo H418 3.0 0.9 Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 2.2 2.0\r\n[L2370] Kumho Solus KH16 6.2 3.4 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 2.5 2.7\r\n[L2371] Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.0 1.8 Sumitomo HTR+ 4.4 3.7\r\n[L2372] Michelin Pilot XGT H4 1.1 0.7\r\n[L2373] Does filling tires with nitrogen instead of compressed air reduce pressure loss? \r\n[L2374] Give appropriate graphical and numerical evidence to support your answer.","[L2375] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>","[L2376] 252 CHAPTER CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2377] s We can produce data intended to answer specific questions by observational\r\n[L2378] studies or experiments. An observational study gathers data on individuals \r\n[L2379] as they are. Experiments actively do something to people, animals, or \r\n[L2380] objects in order to measure their response.\r\n[L2381] s Statistical studies often try to show that changing one variable (the \r\n[L2382] explanatory variable) causes changes in another variable (the response\r\n[L2383] variable). Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\n[L2384] be distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\n[L2385] experiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\n[L2386] actually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\n[L2387] variable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\n[L2388] s In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\n[L2389] is a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\n[L2390] s The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\n[L2391] manner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\n[L2392] principles of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\n[L2393] assignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\n[L2394] s The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\n[L2395] two or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\n[L2396] with other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\n[L2397] s Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\n[L2398] Random assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\n[L2399] chance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\n[L2400] comparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\n[L2401] s Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\n[L2402] reduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\n[L2403] likely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\n[L2404] s Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\n[L2405] neither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\n[L2406] responses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\n[L2407] the other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\n[L2408] s Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\n[L2409] That helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\n[L2410] patients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\n[L2411] they have received an inactive treatment.\r\n[L2412] s In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\n[L2413] individuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\n[L2414] Randomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\n[L2415] helps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\n[L2416] s Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\n[L2417] treatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\n[L2418] treatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\n[L2419] closely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\n[L2420] Summary SECTION 4.2","[L2421] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","[L2423] Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n[L2424] 45.

In \r\n[L2525] some calls, the interviewer gave her name, in others \r\n[L2526] she identified the university she was representing, \r\n[L2527] and in still others she identified both herself and the \r\n[L2528] university. For each type of call, the interviewer either \r\n[L2529] did or did not offer to send a copy of the final survey \r\n[L2530] results to the person interviewed. Do these differences \r\n[L2531] in the introduction affect whether the interview is \r\n[L2532] completed?\r\n[L2533] 54. Eat well and exercise Most American adolescents \r\n[L2534] don\u2019t eat well and don\u2019t exercise enough. Can middle \r\n[L2535] schools increase physical activity among \r\n[L2536] their students? Can they persuade students to eat \r\n[L2537] better? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\n[L2538] intervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\n[L2539] school day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\n[L2540] for healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\n[L2541] school was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention. The \r\n[L2542] investigators observed physical activity and lunchtime \r\n[L2543] consumption of fat.\r\n[L2544] 55. Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\n[L2545] will use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\n[L2546] raise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\n[L2547] either 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n[L2548] 150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\n[L2549] combinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\n[L2550] fabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\n[L2551] for quality.\r\n[L2552] 56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\n[L2553] the increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\n[L2554] they stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\n[L2555] beat of a metronome. The step was either 5.75 or 11.5 \r\n[L2556] inches high and the metronome beat was 14, 21, or \r\n[L2557] 28 steps per minute. Five students stepped at each \r\n[L2558] combination of height and speed.\r\n[L2559] 57. Cocoa and blood flow A study conducted by Nor\ufffeman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham \r\n[L2560] and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, \r\n[L2561] involved 27 healthy people aged 18 to 72. Each \r\n[L2562] subject consumed a cocoa beverage containing 900 \r\n[L2563] milligrams of flavonols (a class of flavonoids) daily \r\n[L2564] for five days. Using a finger cuff, blood flow was mea\ufffesured on the first and fifth days of the study. After five \r\n[L2565] days, researchers measured what they called \u201csignifi\ufffecant improvement\u201d in blood flow and the function of \r\n[L2566] the cells that line the blood vessels.33 What flaw in the \r\n[L2567] design of this experiment makes it impossible to say \r\n[L2568] whether the cocoa really caused the improved blood \r\n[L2569] flow? Explain.\r\n[L2570] 58. Reducing unemployment Will cash bonuses speed \r\n[L2571] the return to work of unemployed people? A state \r\n[L2572] department of labor notes that last year 68% of people \r\n[L2573] who filed claims for unemployment insurance found \r\n[L2574] a new job within 15 weeks. As an experiment, this year \r\n[L2575] the state offers $500 to people filing unemployment \r\n[L2576] claims if they find a job within 15 weeks. The percent \r\n[L2577] who do so increases to 77%. What flaw in the design \r\n[L2578] of this experiment makes it impossible to say whether \r\n[L2579] the bonus really caused the increase? Explain.\r\n[L2580] 59. Layoffs and \u201csurvivor guilt\u201d Workers who survive a \r\n[L2581] layoff of other employees at their location may suffer \r\n[L2582] from \u201csurvivor guilt.\u201d A study of survivor guilt and \r\n[L2583] its effects used as subjects 120 students who were \r\n[L2584] offered an opportunity to earn extra course credit by \r\n[L2585] doing proofreading. Each subject worked in the same \r\n[L2586] cubicle as another student, who was an accomplice \r\n[L2587] of the experimenters. At a break midway through the \r\n[L2588] work, one of three things happened:\r\n[L2589] Treatment 1: The accomplice was told to leave; it was \r\n[L2590] explained that this was because she performed poorly.\r\n[L2591] Treatment 2: It was explained that unforeseen circum\ufffestances meant there was only enough work for one \r\n[L2592] person. By \u201cchance,\u201d the accomplice was chosen to \r\n[L2593] be laid off.\r\n[L2594] Treatment 3: Both students continued to work after \r\n[L2595] the break.\r\n[L2596] The subjects\u2019 work performance after the break \r\n[L2597] was compared with performance before the break.34\r\n[L2598] Describe how you would randomly assign the \r\n[L2599] subjects to the treatments\r\n[L2600] (a) using slips of paper.\r\n[L2601] (b) using Table D.\r\n[L2602] (c) using technology.\r\n[L2603] 60.

Headache relief Doctors identify \u201cchronic tension\ufffetype headaches\u201d as headaches that occur almost \r\n[L2615] daily for at least six months. Can antidepressant \r\n[L2616] medications or stress management training reduce \r\n[L2617] the number and severity of these headaches? Are both \r\n[L2618] together more effective than either alone? Investiga\ufffetors compared four treatments: antidepressant alone, \r\n[L2619] placebo alone, antidepressant plus stress manage\ufffement, and placebo plus stress management. The \r\n[L2620] headache sufferers named in the following table have \r\n[L2621] agreed to participate in the study.\r\n[L2622] Acosta Duncan Han Liang Padilla Valasco\r\n[L2623] Asihiro Durr Howard Maldonado Plochman Vaughn\r\n[L2624] Bennett Edwards Hruska Marsden Rosen Wei\r\n[L2625] Bikalis Farouk Imrani Montoya Solomon Wilder\r\n[L2626] Chen Fleming James O\u2019Brian Trujillo Willis\r\n[L2627] Clemente George Kaplan Ogle Tullock Zhang\r\n[L2628] (a) Outline the design of the experiment.

The changing climate will \r\n[L2634] probably bring more rain to California, but we don\u2019t \r\n[L2635] know whether the additional rain will come during the \r\n[L2636] winter wet season or extend into the long dry season in \r\n[L2637] spring and summer. Kenwyn Suttle of the University \r\n[L2638] of California at Berkeley and his coworkers carried \r\n[L2639] out an experiment to study the effects of more rain in \r\n[L2640] either season. They randomly assigned plots of open \r\n[L2641] grassland to 3 treatments: added water equal to 20% of \r\n[L2642] annual rainfall either during January to March (winter) \r\n[L2643] or during April to June (spring), and no added water \r\n[L2644] (control). Thirty-six circular plots of area 70 square me\ufffeters were available (see the photo), of which 18 were \r\n[L2645] used for this study. One response variable was total \r\n[L2646] plant biomass, in grams per square meter, produced in \r\n[L2647] a plot over a year.35\r\n[L2648] (a) Outline the design of the experiment.

Treating prostate disease A large study used records \r\n[L2654] from Canada\u2019s national health care system to com\ufffepare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate \r\n[L2655] disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery \r\n[L2656] and a new method that does not require surgery. The \r\n[L2657] records described many patients whose doctors had \r\n[L2658] chosen each method. The study found that patients \r\n[L2659] treated by the new method were significantly more \r\n[L2660] likely to die within 8 years.36\r\n[L2661] (a) Further study of the data showed that this conclu\ufffesion was wrong. The extra deaths among patients who \r\n[L2662] got the new method could be explained by lurking vari\ufffeables. What lurking variables might be confounded with \r\n[L2663] a doctor\u2019s choice of surgical or nonsurgical treatment?\r\n[L2664] (b) You have 300 prostate patients who are willing to \r\n[L2665] serve as subjects in an experiment to compare the two \r\n[L2666] methods.

Getting teachers to come to school Elementary \r\n[L2669] schools in rural India are usually small, with a single \r\n[L2670] teacher. The teachers often fail to show up for work. \r\n[L2671] Here is an idea for improving attendance: give the \r\n[L2672] teacher a digital camera with a tamperproof time \r\n[L2673] and date stamp and ask a student to take a photo of \r\n[L2674] the teacher and class at the beginning and end of the \r\n[L2675] day. Offer the teacher better pay for good attendance, \r\n[L2676] verified by the photos. Will this work? Researchers \r\n[L2677] obtained permission to use 120 rural schools in \r\n[L2678] Rajasthan for an experiment to find out.37\r\n[L2679] (a) Explain why it would not be a good idea to offer \r\n[L2680] better pay for good attendance to the teachers in all \r\n[L2681] 120 schools and then to compare this year\u2019s atten\ufffedance with last year\u2019s.\r\n[L2682] (b) Write a few sentences describing how you would \r\n[L2683] design this experiment.\r\n[L2684] 65. Stronger players A football coach hears that a new \r\n[L2685] exercise program will increase upper-body strength \r\n[L2686] better than lifting weights.

The effects of day care Does day care help low\ufffeincome children stay in school and hold good jobs \r\n[L2712] later in life? The Carolina Abecedarian Project (the \r\n[L2713] name suggests the ABCs) has followed a group of \r\n[L2714] 111 children since 1972. Back then, these individu\ufffeals were all healthy but low-income black infants in \r\n[L2715] Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All the infants received \r\n[L2716] nutritional supplements and help from social workers. \r\n[L2717] Half were also assigned at random to an intensive \r\n[L2718] preschool program.38\r\n[L2719] (a) Explain the purpose of each of the three experi\ufffemental design principles.\r\n[L2720] (b) Describe how each of these principles was used \r\n[L2721] in this study.\r\n[L2722] 68. Killing weeds A biologist would like to determine \r\n[L2723] which of two brands of weed killer is less likely to \r\n[L2724] harm the plants in a garden at the university. Before \r\n[L2725] spraying near the plants, the biologist decides to \r\n[L2726] conduct an experiment using 24 individual plants. \r\n[L2727] Which of the following two plans for randomly \r\n[L2728] assigning the treatments should the biologist use? \r\n[L2729] Why?\r\n[L2730] Plan A: Choose the 12 healthiest-looking plants. \r\n[L2731] Apply Brand X weed killer to all 12 of those plants. \r\n[L2732] Apply Brand Y weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2733] Plan B: Choose 12 of the 24 plants at random. Apply \r\n[L2734] Brand X weed killer to those 12 plants and Brand Y \r\n[L2735] weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2736] 69. Do placebos really work? Researchers in Japan \r\n[L2737] conducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\n[L2738] were extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\n[L2739] each subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\n[L2740] told the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\n[L2741] subject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\n[L2742] was poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\n[L2743] the arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n[L2744] 13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\n[L2745] poison ivy leaf.39\r\n[L2746] (a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n[L2747] (b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\n[L2748] idea of a placebo effect.\r\n[L2749] 70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\n[L2750] chronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\n[L2751] and needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\n[L2752] will be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\n[L2753] percent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n[L2754] (a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\n[L2755] drug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n[L2756] (b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\n[L2757] getting the new drug or a placebo? How would this \r\n[L2758] knowledge probably affect their reactions?\r\n[L2759] 71. Meditation for anxiety An experiment that claimed \r\n[L2760] to show that meditation lowers anxiety proceeded as \r\n[L2761] follows. The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\n[L2762] and rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\n[L2763] were randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\n[L2764] meditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\n[L2765] simply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\n[L2766] the experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\n[L2767] and rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\n[L2768] now had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\n[L2769] Explain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\n[L2770] could bias the reported results.\r\n[L2771] 72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\n[L2772] testosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\n[L2773] cause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\n[L2774] fat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\n[L2775] supplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\n[L2776] in the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\n[L2777] with low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\n[L2778] a testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\n[L2779] in the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\n[L2780] described the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\n[L2781] placebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\n[L2782] terms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n[L2783] 73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\n[L2784] determine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\n[L2785] acupuncture could help infertile women become \r\n[L2786] pregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\n[L2787] undergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\n[L2788] were recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\n[L2789] randomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n[L2790] 25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\n[L2791] minutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\n[L2792] were instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\n[L2793] embryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n[L2794] 34 women became pregnant. In the control group, \r\n[L2795] 21 women became pregnant.\r\n[L2796] (a) Describe how the three principles of experimen\ufffetal design were addressed in this study.\r\n[L2797] (b) The difference in the percent of women who \r\n[L2798] became pregnant in the two groups is statistically \r\n[L2799] significant. Explain what this means to someone who \r\n[L2800] knows little statistics.\r\n[L2801] (c) Explain why the placebo effect prevents us from \r\n[L2802] concluding that acupuncture caused the difference in \r\n[L2803] pregnancy rates.\r\n[L2804] pg 241","[L2805] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>","[L2806] Section 4.2 Experiments 257\r\n[L2807] 74. Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\n[L2808] colleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\n[L2809] Half of the participants were randomly assigned \r\n[L2810] to a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\n[L2811] assigned to a low-fat diet.

According to the popular \r\n[L2827] TV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\n[L2828] March 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\n[L2829] presented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\n[L2830] subjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\n[L2831] an extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\n[L2832] camera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\n[L2833] seed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\n[L2834] yawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\n[L2835] who had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\n[L2836] given a yawn seed, 10 yawned. Adam Savage and Ja\ufffemie Hyneman, the cohosts of Mythbusters, used these \r\n[L2837] results to conclude that yawning is contagious.\r\n[L2838] (a) Explain how you could use slips of paper to ran\ufffedomly reassign the subjects to the treatment groups.\r\n[L2839] (b) Suppose we used your method in (a) to redo the \r\n[L2840] random assignment 50 times.

Doctors and nurses Nurse-practitioners are nurses \r\n[L2864] with advanced qualifications who often act much like \r\n[L2865] primary-care physicians. Are they as effective as \r\n[L2866] doctors at treating patients with chronic conditions? \r\n[L2867] An experiment was conducted with 1316 patients \r\n[L2868] who had been diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, or \r\n[L2869] high blood pressure. Within each condition, patients \r\n[L2870] were randomly assigned to either a doctor or a \r\n[L2871] nurse-practitioner. The response variables included \r\n[L2872] measures of the patients\u2019 health and of their \r\n[L2873] satisfaction with their medical care after 6 months.43\r\n[L2874] (a) Which are the blocks in this experiment: the \r\n[L2875] different diagnoses (asthma, etc.) or the type of care \r\n[L2876] (nurse or doctor)? Why?\r\n[L2877] (b) Explain why a randomized block design is \r\n[L2878] preferable to a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2879] setting.\r\n[L2880] 78. Comparing cancer treatments The progress of a \r\n[L2881] type of cancer differs in women and men. Researchers \r\n[L2882] want to design an experiment to compare three thera\ufffepies for this cancer.

In the cornfield An agriculture researcher wants to \r\n[L2895] compare the yield of 5 corn varieties: A, B, C, D, and \r\n[L2896] E. The field in which the experiment will be carried \r\n[L2897] out increases in fertility from north to south. The \r\n[L2898] researcher therefore divides the field into 25 plots \r\n[L2899] of equal size, arranged in 5 east\u2013west rows of 5 plots \r\n[L2900] each, as shown in the diagram.\r\n[L2901] North\r\n[L2902] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2903] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2904] setting.\r\n[L2905] (b) Should the researcher use the rows or the \r\n[L2906] columns of the field as blocks?

Comparing weight-loss treatments Twenty over\ufffeweight females have agreed to participate in a study \r\n[L2911] of the effectiveness of four weight-loss treatments: \r\n[L2912] A, B, C, and D. The researcher first calculates how \r\n[L2913] overweight each subject is by comparing the subject\u2019s \r\n[L2914] actual weight with her \u201cideal\u201d weight. The subjects \r\n[L2915] and their excess weights in pounds are as follows:\r\n[L2916] Birnbaum 35 Hernandez 25 Moses 25 Smith 29\r\n[L2917] Brown 34 Jackson 33 Nevesky 39 Stall 33\r\n[L2918] Brunk 30 Kendall 28 Obrach 30 Tran 35\r\n[L2919] Cruz 34 Loren 32 Rodriguez 30 Wilansky 42\r\n[L2920] Deng 24 Mann 28 Santiago 27 Williams 22\r\n[L2921] The response variable is the weight lost after 8 weeks of \r\n[L2922] treatment.

A nutrition experimenter intends to \r\n[L2934] compare the weight gain of newly weaned male \r\n[L2935] rats fed Diet A with that of rats fed Diet B. To do this, \r\n[L2936] she will feed each diet to 10 rats. She has available \r\n[L2937] 10 rats from one litter and 10 rats from a second \r\n[L2938] litter. Rats in the first litter appear to be slightly \r\n[L2939] healthier.\r\n[L2940] (a) If the 10 rats from Litter 1 were fed Diet A, the \r\n[L2941] effects of genetics and diet would be confounded, and \r\n[L2942] the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A. \r\n[L2943] Explain this statement carefully.\r\n[L2944] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2945] 82. Technology for teaching statistics The Brigham \r\n[L2946] Young University (BYU) statistics department is \r\n[L2947] performing experiments to compare teaching meth\ufffeods. Response variables include students\u2019 final-exam \r\n[L2948] scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. \r\n[L2949] One study compares two levels of technology for large \r\n[L2950] lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) \r\n[L2951] and multimedia. There are 8 lecture sections of a \r\n[L2952] basic statistics course at BYU, each with about 200 \r\n[L2953] students. There are four instructors, each of whom \r\n[L2954] teaches two sections.44 Suppose the sections and \r\n[L2955] lecturers are as follows:\r\n[L2956] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2957] 1 Hilton\r\n[L2958] 2 Christensen\r\n[L2959] 3 Hadfield\r\n[L2960] 4 Hadfield\r\n[L2961] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2962] 5 Tolley\r\n[L2963] 6 Hilton\r\n[L2964] 7 Tolley\r\n[L2965] 8 Christensen\r\n[L2966] (a) Suppose we randomly assign two lecturers to use \r\n[L2967] standard technology in their sections and the other \r\n[L2968] two lecturers to use multimedia technology.

Chocolate gets my heart pumping Cardiologists \r\n[L3000] at Athens Medical School in Greece wanted to test \r\n[L3001] whether chocolate affected blood flow in the blood \r\n[L3002] vessels. The researchers recruited 17 healthy young \r\n[L3003] volunteers, who were each given a 3.5-ounce bar of \r\n[L3004] dark chocolate, either bittersweet or fake chocolate. \r\n[L3005] On another day, the volunteers were switched. The \r\n[L3006] subjects had no chocolate outside the study, and \r\n[L3007] investigators didn\u2019t know whether a subject had eaten \r\n[L3008] the real or the fake chocolate. An ultrasound was \r\n[L3009] taken of each volunteer\u2019s upper arm to see the func\ufffetioning of the cells in the walls of the main artery. \r\n[L3010] The investigators found that blood vessel function was \r\n[L3011] improved when the subjects ate bittersweet chocolate, \r\n[L3012] and that there were no such changes when they ate \r\n[L3013] the placebo (fake chocolate).45\r\n[L3014] (a) What type of design did the investigators use in \r\n[L3015] their study?\r\n[L3016] (b) Explain why the investigators chose this design \r\n[L3017] instead of a completely randomized design.\r\n[L3018] (c) Why is it important to randomly assign the order \r\n[L3019] of the treatments for the subjects?\r\n[L3020] 85. Room temperature and dexterity An expert on \r\n[L3021] worker performance is interested in the effect of \r\n[L3022] room temperature on the performance of tasks \r\n[L3023] requiring manual dexterity. She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\n[L3024] variable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\n[L3025] a 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\n[L3026] requires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\n[L3027] subject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\n[L3028] make as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\n[L3029] continuous effort.\r\n[L3030] (a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\n[L3031] compare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\n[L3032] available.\r\n[L3033] (b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\n[L3034] wide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\n[L3035] subjects in each group. Describe in detail the design \r\n[L3036] of a matched pairs experiment in which each subject \r\n[L3037] serves as his or her own control.\r\n[L3038] 86. Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\n[L3039] of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\n[L3040] increasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\n[L3041] Because plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\n[L3042] CO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\n[L3043] An elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\n[L3044] CO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\n[L3045] the growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\n[L3046] untreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\n[L3047] growth. We can afford to treat three circular areas.46\r\n[L3048] (a) Describe the design of a completely randomized \r\n[L3049] experiment using 6 well-separated 30-meter circular \r\n[L3050] areas in a pine forest.

Separate by \r\n[L3061] gender, since male and female bodies might respond \r\n[L3062] differently to deodorant. Give all the males Brand A \r\n[L3063] deodorant and all the females Brand B. Have each \r\n[L3064] student rate how well the deodorant is still working \r\n[L3065] at the end of the school day on a 0 to 10 scale. Then \r\n[L3066] compare ratings for the two treatments.\r\n[L3067] (a) Identify any flaws you see in the proposed design \r\n[L3068] for this experiment.\r\n[L3069] (b) Describe how you would design the experiment. \r\n[L3070] Explain how your design addresses each of the \r\n[L3071] problems you identified in (a).\r\n[L3072] 88.

Can changing diet reduce high blood pressure? \r\n[L3098] Vegetarian diets and low-salt diets are both promising. \r\n[L3099] Men with high blood pressure are assigned at random \r\n[L3100] to four diets: (1) normal diet with unrestricted salt; \r\n[L3101] (2) vegetarian with unrestricted salt; (3) normal with \r\n[L3102] restricted salt; and (4) vegetarian with restricted salt. \r\n[L3103] This experiment has\r\n[L3104] (a) one factor, the type of diet.\r\n[L3105] (b) two factors, high blood pressure and type of diet.\r\n[L3106] (c) two factors, normal/vegetarian diet and unre\ufffestricted/restricted salt.\r\n[L3107] (d) three factors, men, high blood pressure, and type \r\n[L3108] of diet.\r\n[L3109] (e) four factors, the four diets being compared.\r\n[L3110] 92.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L3219] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L3220] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L3221] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L3222] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L3223] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L3224] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3225] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L3226] on the design of the study.\r\n[L3227] Scope of Inference\r\n[L3228] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L3229] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L3230] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L3231] results of the sample.\r\n[L3232] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L3233] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L3234] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L3235] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L3236] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L3237] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L3238] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L3239] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L3240] 4.3\r\n[L3241] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","[L3242] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3243] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","[L3244] 262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3245] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L3246] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L3247] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L3248] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L3249] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L3250] Yes No\r\n[L3251] Were individuals \r\n[L3252] randomly selected?\r\n[L3253] Yes\r\n[L3254] Inference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\n[L3255] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3256] No Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\n[L3257] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3258] Well-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\n[L3259] However, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\n[L3260] larger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\n[L3261] effect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\n[L3262] rules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\n[L3263] random sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\n[L3264] example illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\n[L3265] EXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\n[L3266] Determining scope of inference\r\n[L3267] A small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\n[L3268] The dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\n[L3269] Design 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3270] to take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L3271] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L3272] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L3273] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L3274] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3275] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L3276] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3277] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3278] part in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3279] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3280] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L3281] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3282] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L3283] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L3284] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L3285] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L3286] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L3287] SOLUTION:\r\n[L3288] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L3289] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments ","[L3290] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a9a2c4c5c24a51b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_57.jpg","size_bytes":59616,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3291] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>","[L3292] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L3293] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3294] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L3295] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L3296] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L3297] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L3298] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L3299] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L3300] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L3301] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L3302] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L3303] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L3304] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L3305] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L3306] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L3307] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L3308] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L3309] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L3310] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L3311] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L3312] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L3313] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L3314] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L3315] the town.\r\n[L3316] The Challenges of \r\n[L3317] Establishing Causation\r\n[L3318] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L3319] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L3320] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L3321] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L3322] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L3323] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L3324] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\n[L3325] Lack of realism\r\n[L3326] Do those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3327] since 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\n[L3328] showed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\n[L3329] But requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\n[L3330] What happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\n[L3331] all cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\n[L3332] For Practice Try Exercise 105","[L3333] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3334] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","[L3335] 264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3336] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3337] In some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\n[L3338] these important questions:\r\n[L3339] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L3340] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L3341] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L3342] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L3343] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L3344] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L3345] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L3346] studies.\r\n[L3347] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L3348] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L3349] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L3350] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L3351] Living with observational studies\r\n[L3352] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L3353] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L3354] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L3355] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L3356] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L3357] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L3358] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L3359] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L3360] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L3361] experiment?\r\n[L3362] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L3363] very strong.\r\n[L3364] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L3365] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L3366] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L3367] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L3368] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L3369] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L3370] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L3371] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L3372] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L3373] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L3374] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L3375] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L3376] cancer death among women.","[L3377] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3378] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","[L3379] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L3380] sThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\n[L3381] cigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\n[L3382] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L3383] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3384] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L3385] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L3386] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L3387] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\n[L3388] observational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\n[L3389] Data Ethics*\r\n[L3390] Medical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\n[L3391] Shouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\n[L3392] reasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L3393] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L3394] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L3395] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L3396] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L3397] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L3398] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L3399] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L3400] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L3401] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L3402] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L3403] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\n[L3404] knows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\n[L3405] the physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\n[L3406] sWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L3407] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L3408] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L3409] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L3410] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L3411] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\n[L3412] are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\n[L3413] data from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\n[L3414] Basic Data Ethics\r\n[L3415] All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\n[L3416] board charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\n[L3417] All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\n[L3418] before data are collected.\r\n[L3419] All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\n[L3420] groups of subjects may be made public.\r\n[L3421] *This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","[L3422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","[L3423] 266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3424] The law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\n[L3425] obey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\n[L3426] Institutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\n[L3427] to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\n[L3428] it is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\n[L3429] board, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\n[L3430] recruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\n[L3431] study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\n[L3432] are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\n[L3433] research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\n[L3434] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L3435] boards.\r\n[L3436] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L3437] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L3438] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L3439] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L3440] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L3441] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L3442] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L3443] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L3444] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L3445] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L3446] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L3447] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L3448] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L3449] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L3450] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity.

Anonymity is rare in statistical stud\ufffeies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it \r\n[L3454] prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform individuals of results.\r\n[L3455] Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L3456] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L3457] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L3458] other identification have been removed from the data available for search.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L3496] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L3497] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L3498] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L3499] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L3500] results.\r\n[L3501] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L3502] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L3503] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L3504] lurking variables.\r\n[L3505] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L3506] review board. All participants must give their informed consent before \r\n[L3507] taking part. Any information about the individuals in the study must be \r\n[L3508] kept confidential.\r\n[L3509] s Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions \r\n[L3510] that can\u2019t be answered without them. Also remember that \u201cthe interests of \r\n[L3511] the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\u201d54\r\n[L3512] Summary SECTION 4.3\r\n[L3513] Magnets and Pain\r\n[L3514] Let\u2019s return to the chapter-opening Case Study (page 205). Researchers carried \r\n[L3515] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L3516] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\n[L3517] dotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\n[L3518] magnet).\r\n[L3519] The average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\n[L3520] and 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\n[L3521] significant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\n[L3522] The difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\n[L3523] too large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain. But since the subjects were volunteers, we can\u2019t \r\n[L3524] safely generalize the findings of this experiment to any larger \r\n[L3525] population.\r\n[L3526] case closed","[L3527] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 65 / 75>","[L3528] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 269\r\n[L3529] 102. Random sampling versus random assignment\r\n[L3530] Explain the difference between the types of \r\n[L3531] inference that can be made as a result of random \r\n[L3532] sampling and random assignment.\r\n[L3533] 103. Foster care versus orphanages Do abandoned \r\n[L3534] children placed in foster homes do better than \r\n[L3535] similar children placed in an institution? The \r\n[L3536] Bucharest Early Intervention Project found that \r\n[L3537] the answer is a clear \u201cYes.\u201d The subjects were 136 \r\n[L3538] young children abandoned at birth and living in \r\n[L3539] orphanages in Bucharest, Romania. Half of the \r\n[L3540] children, chosen at random, were placed in foster \r\n[L3541] homes. The other half remained in the orphanages.55\r\n[L3542] (Foster care was not easily available in Romania at \r\n[L3543] the time and so was paid for by the study.) What \r\n[L3544] conclusion can we draw from this study? Explain.\r\n[L3545] 104. Frozen batteries Will storing batteries in a freezer \r\n[L3546] make them last longer? To find out, a company that \r\n[L3547] produces batteries takes a random sample of 100 AA \r\n[L3548] batteries from its warehouse. The company \r\n[L3549] statistician randomly assigns 50 batteries to be stored \r\n[L3550] in the freezer and the other 50 to be stored at room \r\n[L3551] temperature for 3 years. At the end of that time \r\n[L3552] period, each battery\u2019s charge is tested. Result:\r\n[L3553] Batteries stored in the freezer had a higher average \r\n[L3554] charge, and the difference between the groups was \r\n[L3555] statistically significant. What conclusion can we \r\n[L3556] draw from this study? Explain.\r\n[L3557] 105. Who talks more\u2014women or men? According to \r\n[L3558] Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain,\r\n[L3559] women say nearly three times as many words per day \r\n[L3560] as men. Skeptical researchers devised a study to test \r\n[L3561] this claim. They used electronic devices to record \r\n[L3562] the talking patterns of 396 university students who \r\n[L3563] volunteered to participate in the study. The device \r\n[L3564] was programmed to record 30 seconds of sound \r\n[L3565] every 12.5 minutes without the carrier\u2019s knowledge. \r\n[L3566] According to a published report of the study in \r\n[L3567] Scientific American, \u201cMen showed a slightly wider \r\n[L3568] variability in words uttered.... But in the end, the \r\n[L3569] sexes came out just about even in the daily averages: \r\n[L3570] women at 16,215 words and men at 15,669.\u201d56 This \r\n[L3571] difference was not statistically significant. What \r\n[L3572] conclusion can we draw from this study? Explain.\r\n[L3573] 106. Attend church, live longer? One of the better \r\n[L3574] studies of the effect of regular attendance at religious \r\n[L3575] services gathered data from a random sample of \r\n[L3576] 3617 adults. The researchers then measured lots of \r\n[L3577] variables, not just the explanatory variable (religious \r\n[L3578] activities) and the response variable (length of life). \r\n[L3579] A news article said: \u201cChurchgoers were more likely \r\n[L3580] to be nonsmokers, physically active, and at their \r\n[L3581] right weight. But even after health behaviors were \r\n[L3582] taken into account, those not attending religious \r\n[L3583] services regularly still were about 25% more likely to \r\n[L3584] have died.\u201d57 What conclusion can we draw from \r\n[L3585] this study? Explain.\r\n[L3586] 107. Daytime running lights Canada requires that cars \r\n[L3587] be equipped with \u201cdaytime running lights,\u201d \r\n[L3588] headlights that automatically come on at a low \r\n[L3589] level when the car is started. Some manufacturers \r\n[L3590] are now equipping cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3591] with running lights. Will running lights reduce \r\n[L3592] accidents by making cars more visible? An \r\n[L3593] experiment conducted in a driving simulator \r\n[L3594] suggests that the answer may be \u201cYes.\u201d What \r\n[L3595] concerns would you have about generalizing the \r\n[L3596] results of such an experiment?\r\n[L3597] 108. Studying frustration A psychologist wants to study \r\n[L3598] the effects of failure and frustration on the \r\n[L3599] relationships among members of a work team. \r\n[L3600] She forms a team of students, brings them to the \r\n[L3601] psychology lab, and has them play a game that \r\n[L3602] requires teamwork. The game is rigged so that they \r\n[L3603] lose regularly. The psychologist observes the students \r\n[L3604] through a one-way window and notes the changes in \r\n[L3605] their behavior during an evening of game playing. \r\n[L3606] Can the psychologist generalize the results of her \r\n[L3607] study to a team of employees that spends months \r\n[L3608] developing a new product that never works right and \r\n[L3609] is finally abandoned by their company? Explain.\r\n[L3610] 109.* Minimal risk? You have been invited to serve on \r\n[L3611] a college\u2019s institutional review board. You must \r\n[L3612] decide whether several research proposals qualify for \r\n[L3613] lighter review because they involve only minimal \r\n[L3614] risk to subjects. Federal regulations say that \u201cminimal \r\n[L3615] risk\u201d means the risks are no greater than \u201cthose \r\n[L3616] ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the \r\n[L3617] performance of routine physical or psychological \r\n[L3618] examinations or tests.\u201d That\u2019s vague.

Government regulations require that \r\n[L3632] institutional review boards consist of at least five people, \r\n[L3633] including at least one scientist, one nonscientist, and \r\n[L3634] one person from outside the institution. Most boards \r\n[L3635] are larger, but many contain just one outsider.\r\n[L3636] (a) Why should review boards contain people who \r\n[L3637] are not scientists?\r\n[L3638] (b) Do you think that one outside member is \r\n[L3639] enough?

In which of the circumstances \r\n[L3642] below would you allow collecting personal \r\n[L3643] information without the subjects\u2019 consent?\r\n[L3644] (a) A government agency takes a random sample \r\n[L3645] of income tax returns to obtain information on the \r\n[L3646] average income of people in different occupations. \r\n[L3647] Only the incomes and occupations are recorded \r\n[L3648] from the returns, not the names.\r\n[L3649] (b) A social psychologist attends public meetings \r\n[L3650] of a religious group to study the behavior patterns\r\n[L3651] of members.\r\n[L3652] (c) A social psychologist pretends to be converted to \r\n[L3653] membership in a religious group and attends private \r\n[L3654] meetings to study the behavior patterns of members.\r\n[L3655] 112.* Surveys of youth A survey asked teenagers whether \r\n[L3656] they had ever consumed an alcoholic beverage. \r\n[L3657] Those who said \u201cYes\u201d were then asked, \u201cHow old \r\n[L3658] were you when you first consumed an alcoholic \r\n[L3659] beverage?\u201d Should consent of parents be required to \r\n[L3660] ask minors about alcohol, drugs, and other such \r\n[L3661] issues, or is consent of the minors themselves \r\n[L3662] enough? Give reasons for your opinion.\r\n[L3663] 113.*Anonymous? Confidential? One of the most impor\ufffetant nongovernment surveys in the United States is the \r\n[L3664] National Opinion Research Center\u2019s General Social \r\n[L3665] Survey. The GSS regularly monitors public opinion \r\n[L3666] on a wide variety of political and social issues. Inter\ufffeviews are conducted in person in the subject\u2019s home. \r\n[L3667] Are a subject\u2019s responses to GSS questions anonymous, \r\n[L3668] confidential, or both? Explain your answer.\r\n[L3669] 114.*Anonymous? Confidential? Texas A&M, like many \r\n[L3670] universities, offers screening for HIV, the virus that \r\n[L3671] causes AIDS.

Does this describe the \r\n[L3679] anonymous or the confidential screening? Why?\r\n[L3680] 115.* The Willowbrook hepatitis studies In the 1960s, \r\n[L3681] children entering the Willowbrook State School, an \r\n[L3682] institution for the mentally retarded, were \r\n[L3683] deliberately infected with hepatitis. The researchers \r\n[L3684] argued that almost all children in the institution \r\n[L3685] quickly became infected anyway. The studies \r\n[L3686] showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis \r\n[L3687] existed. This finding contributed to the development \r\n[L3688] of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, \r\n[L3689] the Willowbrook studies are now considered an \r\n[L3690] example of unethical research. Explain why, \r\n[L3691] according to current ethical standards, useful results \r\n[L3692] are not enough to allow a study.\r\n[L3693] 116.* Unequal benefits Researchers on aging proposed to \r\n[L3694] investigate the effect of supplemental health services \r\n[L3695] on the quality of life of older people. Eligible \r\n[L3696] patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to \r\n[L3697] be randomly assigned to treatment and control \r\n[L3698] groups. The treatment group would be offered \r\n[L3699] hearing aids, dentures, transportation, and other \r\n[L3700] services not available without charge to the control \r\n[L3701] group. The review board felt that providing these \r\n[L3702] services to some but not other persons in the same \r\n[L3703] institution raised ethical questions. Do you agree?\r\n[L3704] 117. Animal testing (1.1) \u201cIt is right to use animals for \r\n[L3705] medical testing if it might save human lives.\u201d The \r\n[L3706] General Social Survey asked 1152 adults to react to this \r\n[L3707] statement.

Ugly fries Few people want to eat discolored \r\n[L3851] french fries. Potatoes are kept refrigerated before being \r\n[L3852] cut for french fries to prevent spoiling and preserve flavor. \r\n[L3853] But immediate processing of cold potatoes causes discol\ufffeoring due to complex chemical reactions. The potatoes \r\n[L3854] must therefore be brought to room temperature before \r\n[L3855] processing. Researchers want to design an experiment in \r\n[L3856] which tasters will rate the color and flavor of french fries \r\n[L3857] prepared from several groups of potatoes. The potatoes \r\n[L3858] will be freshly picked or stored for a month at room tem\ufffeperature or stored for a month refrigerated. They will then \r\n[L3859] be sliced and cooked either immediately or after an hour \r\n[L3860] at room temperature.

Which of the following statements best \r\n[L4165] describes the distribution of home prices in Sarasota?\r\n[L4166] (a) The distribution is most likely skewed to the left, and \r\n[L4167] the mean is greater than the median.\r\n[L4168] (b) The distribution is most likely skewed to the left, and \r\n[L4169] the mean is less than the median.\r\n[L4170] (c) The distribution is roughly symmetric with a few high \r\n[L4171] outliers, and the mean is approximately equal to the median.\r\n[L4172] (d) The distribution is most likely skewed to the right, and \r\n[L4173] the mean is greater than the median.\r\n[L4174] (e) The distribution is most likely skewed to the right, and \r\n[L4175] the mean is less than the median.\r\n[L4176] AP1.2. A child is 40 inches tall, which places her at the \r\n[L4177] 90th percentile of all children of similar age. The heights for \r\n[L4178] children of this age form an approximately Normal distribu\ufffetion with a mean of 38 inches. Based on this information, \r\n[L4179] what is the standard deviation of the heights of all children \r\n[L4180] of this age?\r\n[L4181] (a) 0.20 inches (c) 0.65 inches (e) 1.56 inches \r\n[L4182] (b) 0.31 inches (d) 1.21 inches\r\n[L4183] AP1.3. A large set of test scores has mean 60 and standard \r\n[L4184] deviation 18. If each score is doubled, and then 5 is sub\ufffetracted from the result, the mean and standard deviation of \r\n[L4185] the new scores are\r\n[L4186] (a) mean 115; std. dev. 31. (d) mean 120; std. dev. 31.\r\n[L4187] (b) mean 115; std. dev. 36. (e) mean 120; std. dev. 36.\r\n[L4188] (c) mean 120; std. dev. 6.\r\n[L4189] AP1.4. For a certain experiment, the available experimen\ufffetal units are eight rats, of which four are female (F1, F2, \r\n[L4190] F3, F4) and four are male (M1, M2, M3, M4). There are to \r\n[L4191] be four treatment groups, A, B, C, and D. If a randomized \r\n[L4192] block design is used, with the experimental units blocked \r\n[L4193] by gender, which of the following assignments of treat\ufffements is impossible?\r\n[L4194] (a) A \u2192 (F1, M1), B \u2192 (F2, M2),\r\n[L4195] C \u2192 (F3, M3), D \u2192 (F4, M4)\r\n[L4196] (b) A \u2192 (F1, M2), B \u2192 (F2, M3),\r\n[L4197] C \u2192 (F3, M4), D \u2192 (F4, M1)\r\n[L4198] (c) A \u2192 (F1, M2), B \u2192 (F3, F2),\r\n[L4199] C \u2192 (F4, M1), D \u2192 (M3, M4)\r\n[L4200] (d) A \u2192 (F4, M1), B \u2192 (F2, M3),\r\n[L4201] C \u2192 (F3, M2), D \u2192 (F1, M4)\r\n[L4202] (e) A \u2192 (F4, M1), B \u2192 (F1, M4),\r\n[L4203] C \u2192 (F3, M2), D \u2192 (F2, M3)\r\n[L4204] AP1.5. For a biology project, you measure the weight in\r\n[L4205] grams (g) and the tail length in millimeters (mm) of a \r\n[L4206] group of mice. The equation of the least-squares line for \r\n[L4207] predicting tail length from weight is\r\n[L4208] predicted tail length = 20 + 3 \u00d7 weight\r\n[L4209] Which of the following is not correct?\r\n[L4210] (a) The slope is 3, which indicates that a mouse\u2019s weight \r\n[L4211] should increase by about 3 grams for each additional mil\ufffelimeter of tail length.\r\n[L4212] (b) The predicted tail length of a mouse that weighs \r\n[L4213] 38 grams is 134 millimeters.\r\n[L4214] Cumulative AP Practice Test 1 \r\n[L4215] Section I: Multiple Choice Choose the best answer for Questions AP1.1 to AP1.14.","[L4216] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 73 / 75>","[L4217] Cumulative AP Practice Test 1 277\r\n[L4218] (c) By looking at the equation of the least-squares line, you \r\n[L4219] can see that the correlation between weight and tail length \r\n[L4220] is positive.\r\n[L4221] (d) If you had measured the tail length in centimeters \r\n[L4222] instead of millimeters, the slope of the regression line \r\n[L4223] would have been 3/10 = 0.3.\r\n[L4224] (e) One mouse weighed 29 grams and had a tail length of \r\n[L4225] 100 millimeters. The residual for this mouse is \u22127.\r\n[L4226] AP1.6. The figure below shows a Normal density curve. \r\n[L4227] Which of the following gives the best estimates for the \r\n[L4228] mean and standard deviation of this Normal distribution?\r\n[L4229] 0.000\r\n[L4230] 0.002\r\n[L4231] 0.004\r\n[L4232] 0.006\r\n[L4233] 0.008\r\n[L4234] 0.010\r\n[L4235] 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\r\n[L4236] (a) \u03bc = 200, \u03c3 = 50 (d) \u03bc = 225, \u03c3 = 25\r\n[L4237] (b) \u03bc = 200, \u03c3 = 25 (e) \u03bc = 225, \u03c3 = 275 \r\n[L4238] (c) \u03bc = 225, \u03c3 = 50\r\n[L4239] AP1.7. The owner of a chain of supermarkets notices that \r\n[L4240] there is a positive correlation between the sales of beer \r\n[L4241] and the sales of ice cream over the course of the previous \r\n[L4242] year. During seasons when sales of beer were above aver\ufffeage, sales of ice cream also tended to be above average. \r\n[L4243] Likewise, during seasons when sales of beer were below \r\n[L4244] average, sales of ice cream also tended to be below average. \r\n[L4245] Which of the following would be a valid conclusion from \r\n[L4246] these facts?\r\n[L4247] (a) Sales records must be in error. There should be no \r\n[L4248] association between beer and ice cream sales.\r\n[L4249] (b) Evidently, for a significant proportion of customers of \r\n[L4250] these supermarkets, drinking beer causes a desire for ice \r\n[L4251] cream or eating ice cream causes a thirst for beer.\r\n[L4252] (c) A scatterplot of monthly ice cream sales versus \r\n[L4253] monthly beer sales would show that a straight line describes\r\n[L4254] the pattern in the plot, but it would have to be a horizontal \r\n[L4255] line.\r\n[L4256] (d) There is a clear negative association between beer sales \r\n[L4257] and ice cream sales.\r\n[L4258] (e) The positive correlation is most likely a result of the \r\n[L4259] lurking variable temperature; that is, as temperatures \r\n[L4260] increase, so do both beer sales and ice cream sales.\r\n[L4261] AP1.8. Here are the IQ scores of 10 randomly chosen \r\n[L4262] fifth-grade students:\r\n[L4263] 145 139 126 122 125 130 96 110 118 118\r\n[L4264] Which of the following statements about this data set is \r\n[L4265] not true?\r\n[L4266] (a) The student with an IQ of 96 is considered an outlier \r\n[L4267] by the 1.5 \u00d7 IQR rule.\r\n[L4268] (b) The five-number summary of the 10 IQ scores is 96, \r\n[L4269] 118, 123.5, 130, 145.\r\n[L4270] (c) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4271] mean of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be higher than \r\n[L4272] the mean of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4273] (d) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4274] standard deviation of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be \r\n[L4275] lower than the standard deviation of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4276] (e) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4277] IQR of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be lower than the \r\n[L4278] IQR of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4279] AP1.9. Before he goes to bed each night, Mr. Kleen pours \r\n[L4280] dishwasher powder into his dishwasher and turns it on. \r\n[L4281] Each morning, Mrs. Kleen weighs the box of dishwasher \r\n[L4282] powder. From an examination of the data, she concludes \r\n[L4283] that Mr. Kleen dispenses a rather consistent amount \r\n[L4284] of powder each night. Which of the following statements \r\n[L4285] is true?\r\n[L4286] I. There is a high positive correlation between the \r\n[L4287] number of days that have passed since the box of dish\ufffewasher powder was opened and the amount of powder \r\n[L4288] left in the box.\r\n[L4289] II. A scatterplot with days since purchase as the explana\ufffetory variable and amount of dishwasher powder used as \r\n[L4290] the response variable would display a strong positive \r\n[L4291] association.\r\n[L4292] III. The correlation between the amount of powder left in \r\n[L4293] the box and the amount of powder used should be \u22121.\r\n[L4294] (a) I only (c) III only (e) I, II, and III\r\n[L4295] (b) II only (d) II and III only\r\n[L4296] AP1.10. The General Social Survey (GSS), conducted by \r\n[L4297] the National Opinion Research Center at the University \r\n[L4298] of Chicago, is a major source of data on social attitudes in \r\n[L4299] the United States. Once each year, 1500 adults are inter\ufffeviewed in their homes all across the country. The subjects \r\n[L4300] are asked their opinions about sex and marriage, attitudes \r\n[L4301] toward women, welfare, foreign policy, and many other \r\n[L4302] issues. The GSS begins by selecting a sample of counties \r\n[L4303] from the 3000 counties in the country. The counties are \r\n[L4304] divided into urban, rural, and suburban; a separate sample \r\n[L4305] is chosen at random from each group. This is a\r\n[L4306] (a) simple random sample.\r\n[L4307] (b) systematic random sample.","[L4308] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 74 / 75>","[L4309] 278 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L4310] Section II: Free Response Show all your work.

You are planning an experiment to determine \r\n[L4317] the effect of the brand of gasoline and the weight of a car \r\n[L4318] on gas mileage measured in miles per gallon. You will use \r\n[L4319] a single test car, adding weights so that its total weight is \r\n[L4320] 3000, 3500, or 4000 pounds. The car will drive on a test \r\n[L4321] track at each weight using each of Amoco, Marathon, and \r\n[L4322] Speedway gasoline. Which is the best way to organize the \r\n[L4323] study?\r\n[L4324] (a) Start with 3000 pounds and Amoco and run the car on \r\n[L4325] the test track. Then do 3500 and 4000 pounds. Change to \r\n[L4326] Marathon and go through the three weights in order. Then \r\n[L4327] change to Speedway and do the three weights in order\r\n[L4328] once more.\r\n[L4329] (b) Start with 3000 pounds and Amoco and run the car \r\n[L4330] on the test track. Then change to Marathon and then to \r\n[L4331] Speedway without changing the weight. Then add weights \r\n[L4332] to get 3500 pounds and go through the three gasolines in \r\n[L4333] the same order. Then change to 4000 pounds and do the \r\n[L4334] three gasolines in order again.\r\n[L4335] (c) Choose a gasoline at random, and run the car with this \r\n[L4336] gasoline at 3000, 3500, and 4000 pounds in order. Choose \r\n[L4337] one of the two remaining gasolines at random and again \r\n[L4338] run the car at 3000, then 3500, then 4000 pounds. Do the \r\n[L4339] same with the last gasoline.\r\n[L4340] (d) There are nine combinations of weight and gasoline. \r\n[L4341] Run the car several times using each of these combina\ufffetions.

Those who advocate for monetary incentives in \r\n[L4403] a work environment claim that this type of incentive has \r\n[L4404] the greatest appeal because it allows the winners to do what \r\n[L4405] they want with their winnings. Those in favor of tangible \r\n[L4406] incentives argue that money lacks the emotional appeal of, \r\n[L4407] say, a weekend for two at a romantic country inn or elegant \r\n[L4408] hotel or a weeklong trip to Europe.\r\n[L4409] A few years ago a national tire company, in an effort to \r\n[L4410] improve sales of a new line of tires, decided to test which \r\n[L4411] method\u2014offering cash incentives or offering non-cash \r\n[L4412] prizes such as vacations\u2014was more successful in increas\ufffeing sales.

Not only are there national brands for \r\n[L4428] most products, but many stores have their own in-house \r\n[L4429] brands. Since shelf space is not infinite, the question is \r\n[L4430] how many linear feet to allocate to each product and \r\n[L4431] which shelf (top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle) \r\n[L4432] to put it on. The middle shelf is the most popular and lu\ufffecrative, since many shoppers, if undecided, will simply \r\n[L4433] pick the product that is at eye level. \r\n[L4434] A local store that sells many upscale goods is trying to \r\n[L4435] determine how much shelf space to allocate to its own \r\n[L4436] brand of men\u2019s personal-grooming products.

A \\emph{sample} is the part of the population from which we actually collect data, and we use the sample to draw conclusions about the population.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Census and sample survey]\nA \\emph{census} attempts to collect data from every member of the population. A \\emph{sample survey} uses an organized plan to choose a sample that represents a specific population.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\subsection{Planning checklist}\nIn a well-posed sampling problem, you should be able to answer:\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\arabic*.]\n  \\item \\textbf{Who is the population?} (be precise)\n  \\item \\textbf{What variables are measured?} (define them operationally)\n  \\item \\textbf{How is the sample chosen?} (this determines what you can trust)\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{example}[Population vs.\\ sample with numbers]\nA factory produces a \\emph{batch} of $N=500$ items. A quality inspector tests $n=8$ items from that batch.\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Population: all $500$ items in the batch.\n  \\item Sample: the $8$ tested items.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{How to sample badly: bias, convenience samples, voluntary response}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Bias]\nA study design shows \\emph{bias} if it systematically favors certain outcomes (so it tends to overestimate or underestimate the truth in a consistent direction).\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Convenience sample]\nA \\emph{convenience sample} is obtained by choosing individuals who are easiest to reach.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Voluntary response sample]\nA \\emph{voluntary response sample} consists of people who choose themselves by responding to a general invitation. Such samples are often biased because people with strong opinions are more likely to respond.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Always state the direction of the bias]\nWhen asked how a design could lead to bias, do not stop at ``it is biased.'' State \\emph{which way} it likely pushes the result (overestimate vs.\\ underestimate) and why.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{example}[Convenience sampling can overestimate]\nYou want the mean number of hours of homework done last week by all students at a school (population).\nYou sample the first $n=30$ students you see in the library and compute the sample mean:\n\\[\n\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{30}\\sum_{i=1}^{30} x_i.\n\\]\nSuppose the 30 reported hours sum to $ \\sum x_i = 240$; then $\\bar{x}=240/30=8$ hours.\nBecause library visitors may be more studious than average, $\\bar{x}=8$ is plausibly an \\emph{overestimate} of the population mean.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\begin{example}[Voluntary response can be dominated by strong opinions]\nAn online poll about a school policy gets $n=1000$ clicks. Suppose $720$ click ``Yes,'' so $\\hat p = 720/1000 = 0.72$.\nEven though $n$ is large, the sample is self-selected; the $0.72$ may be far from the true population proportion.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{How to sample well: random sampling and the SRS}\n\n\\subsection{The guiding principle}\nTo reduce bias from human choice and self-selection, we let \\emph{impersonal chance} choose the sample.\n\n\\begin{definition}[Simple random sample (SRS)]\nA \\emph{simple random sample (SRS)} of size $n$ is chosen so that \\emph{every set of $n$ individuals} in the population has the same chance to be the sample selected.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\subsection{Basic probability facts implied by the SRS definition}\nLet the population size be $N$ and the sample size be $n$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Number of distinct size-$n$ samples: $\\binom{N}{n}$.\n\\item Each particular size-$n$ sample has probability:\n\\[\n\\PP(\\text{a specific sample is chosen})=\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{n}}.\n\\]\n\\item Each individual has selection probability:\n\\[\n\\PP(\\text{a given individual is selected})=\\frac{n}{N}.\n\\]\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{example}[Compute selection probabilities]\nA class has $N=50$ students. You want an SRS of $n=5$ students.\n\\[\n\\PP(\\text{a given student is selected})=\\frac{5}{50}=0.10.\n\\]\nThere are $\\binom{50}{5}$ possible samples, and each specific 5-person set has probability $1/\\binom{50}{5}$.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{Selecting an SRS in practice: labels and random digits}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Table of random digits (concept)]\nA random-digit source is a long sequence of digits $0$--$9$ behaving like repeated independent draws where each digit is equally likely to be $0,1,\\dots,9$.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\subsection{Two-step procedure (works with a digit table or a computer)}\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\textbf{Step \\arabic*:}, leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Label.} Assign each population member a numerical label of equal length.\n\\item \\textbf{Generate/Read digits.} Read consecutive blocks of digits of the appropriate length. Keep labels that are valid and not repeated. Skip invalid blocks and duplicates. Continue until you have $n$ distinct labels.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{example}[Worked SRS selection using a made-up digit stream]\nYou have $N=28$ hotels. Label them $01,02,\\dots,28$. We want $n=4$ distinct labels.\n\nSuppose the digit stream (grouped into two-digit blocks) begins:\n\\[\n31,\\ 05,\\ 16,\\ 48,\\ 17,\\ 17,\\ 02,\\ 29,\\ 20,\\ 05,\\ 14,\\ 08,\\dots\n\\]\nWe scan left to right:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $31$ (invalid: $>28$) skip.\n\\item $05$ keep (sample: $\\{05\\}$).\n\\item $16$ keep (sample: $\\{05,16\\}$).\n\\item $48$ invalid skip.\n\\item $17$ keep (sample: $\\{05,16,17\\}$).\n\\item next $17$ is a repeat skip.\n\\item $02$ keep (sample: $\\{05,16,17,02\\}$). Stop: we have 4 labels.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo the chosen SRS corresponds to hotels $02,05,16,17$ (in the order found).\n\\end{example}\n\n\\begin{remark}[With vs.\\ without replacement]\nSome random-number tools sample \\emph{with replacement} by default (duplicates can appear). For an SRS \\emph{without replacement}, duplicates must be discarded and replaced by continuing the random process until distinct labels are obtained.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\section{Other sampling methods: stratified, cluster, multistage, systematic}\n\n\\subsection{Stratified random sampling}\n\\begin{definition}[Stratified random sample; strata]\nA \\emph{stratified random sample} is formed by dividing the population into groups called \\emph{strata} (groups similar in a way relevant to the variable), taking an SRS within each stratum, and combining the subsamples.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{example}[Proportional stratified sampling with arithmetic]\nA school has 1000 students:\n\\[\n\\text{Freshmen }400,\\quad \\text{Sophomores }300,\\quad \\text{Juniors }200,\\quad \\text{Seniors }100.\n\\]\nYou want a stratified sample of $n=100$ with proportional allocation.\nCompute each stratum's fraction and sample size:\n\\[\nn_F = 100\\cdot \\frac{400}{1000}=40,\\quad\nn_S = 100\\cdot \\frac{300}{1000}=30,\\quad\nn_J = 100\\cdot \\frac{200}{1000}=20,\\quad\nn_{Sr} = 100\\cdot \\frac{100}{1000}=10.\n\\]\nThen take an SRS of 40 freshmen, 30 sophomores, 20 juniors, 10 seniors, and combine them.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\subsection{Cluster sampling}\n\\begin{definition}[Cluster sample; clusters]\nTo take a \\emph{cluster sample}, divide the population into clusters (ideally each cluster resembles the whole population on a smaller scale), choose an SRS of clusters, and include \\emph{all} individuals in the chosen clusters.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{example}[Cluster sample with numbers]\nA school has 40 homerooms of 25 students each ($40\\times 25=1000$ students).\nTo survey about $n\\approx 200$ students, choose $8$ homerooms at random (an SRS of clusters), then survey all $8\\times 25=200$ students in those homerooms.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Strata vs.\\ clusters (do not confuse)]\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item In \\textbf{stratification}, each stratum is internally similar; strata differ from each other in relevant ways.\n\\item In \\textbf{clustering}, each cluster should (ideally) mirror the population; you then sample clusters for convenience.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection{Multistage sampling}\nLarge surveys often combine methods in stages (for logistics): e.g.\\ select large geographic units, then neighborhoods, then small local clusters within neighborhoods.\n\n\\subsection{Systematic random sampling (often a final-stage tool)}\nA common recipe is:\n\\[\nk=\\frac{N}{n}\\quad (\\text{sampling interval, assume }k\\in \\N).\n\\]\nChoose a random start $s\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}$, then take\n\\[\ns,\\ s+k,\\ s+2k,\\ \\dots,\\ s+(n-1)k.\n\\]\n\n\\begin{example}[Systematic sample with working]\nChoose $n=6$ addresses from a list of $N=120$.\nThen $k=N/n = 120/6 = 20$.\nPick a random start, say $s=7$. The systematic sample is:\n\\[\n7,\\ 27,\\ 47,\\ 67,\\ 87,\\ 107.\n\\]\nEach address has the same chance to be selected (because the start is random), but not every 6-subset is possible, so it is \\emph{not} an SRS.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{Inference and what can go wrong in real surveys}\n\n\\subsection{Inference and sampling variability}\n\\begin{definition}[Inference (informal)]\n\\emph{Inference} means drawing conclusions about a population using data from a sample.\n\\end{definition}\n\nEven for a good random sample, sample-to-sample results vary by chance. This is \\emph{sampling variability}. Polls often summarize expected sampling variability with a \\emph{margin of error}. As a rough principle: larger random samples are typically more precise than smaller ones.\n\n\\begin{remark}[Preview: variability scales like $1/\\sqrt{n}$]\nIn later work, you will see formulas like\n\\[\n\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat p)\\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}},\n\\quad\\text{so typical error shrinks on the order of } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}.\n\\]\nFor now, remember: increasing $n$ reduces random variation, but does \\emph{not} automatically fix bias.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection{Sampling errors vs.\\ nonsampling errors}\n\\begin{definition}[Sampling frame]\nA \\emph{sampling frame} is the list (or mechanism) from which the sample is actually drawn.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Undercoverage]\n\\emph{Undercoverage} occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process of choosing the sample (often because the sampling frame misses them).\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Nonsampling errors]\n\\emph{Nonsampling errors} are errors not caused by the randomness of selecting a sample; they can occur even in a census (e.g.\\ nonresponse, measurement/recording errors, response bias, wording effects).\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Nonresponse]\n\\emph{Nonresponse} occurs when an individual chosen for the sample cannot be contacted or refuses to participate.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Nonresponse vs.\\ voluntary response]\nNonresponse happens \\emph{after} a sample has been selected. A voluntary response poll is self-selected at the start; participants ``opt in,'' so the core problem there is selection bias rather than nonresponse.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection{Response bias and question effects}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Response bias:} a systematic pattern of inaccurate answers (e.g.\\ social desirability, faulty memory, interviewer effects).\n\\item \\textbf{Question wording:} leading or confusing wording can strongly alter results.\n\\item \\textbf{Question order:} earlier questions can prime later answers.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{example}[Computing a nonresponse rate]\nA phone survey dials $45{,}956$ selected numbers, but completes only $5{,}029$ interviews.\n\\[\n\\text{Response rate}=\\frac{5029}{45956}\\approx 0.1094\\approx 10.94\\%.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Nonresponse rate}=1-0.1094\\approx 0.8906\\approx 89.06\\%.\n\\]\nA high nonresponse rate can bias results if responders differ systematically from nonresponders.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section*{Exercises (selected and paraphrased from Section 4.1)}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Exercises (selected and paraphrased from Section 4.1)}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\textbf{4.1.\\arabic*}, leftmargin=*]\n\n\\item \\textbf{Population vs.\\ sample (business survey).}\nA student newspaper randomly chooses 150 local businesses from a phone directory and mails them a questionnaire; 73 respond.\nIdentify the population and the sample(s).

Explain the statistical issue in plain language.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Large online poll does not guarantee trust.}\nAn online poll asks a yes/no question; roughly 44\\% click ``Yes,'' 50\\% click ``No,'' and the rest click ``Don't know,'' with more than 30{,}000 total responses.\nWhy can the result still be untrustworthy despite the large $n$?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Online magazine poll.}\nA magazine invites readers to vote online on whether cell-phone use while driving should be banned. The published results are 85\\% ``Yes,'' 15\\% ``No.''\n(a) What sampling method is being used?\n(b) Explain why it is biased. Is 85\\% likely higher or lower than the population truth? Why?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Early-arrivals survey (sleep).}\nA student surveys the first 100 students to arrive at school and gets an average of 7.2 hours of sleep last night.\n(a) What sampling method is this?\n(b) Explain the likely direction of bias and why.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mall sampling.}\nExplain why interviewing mall shoppers---even many of them---is not a reliable way to estimate a population unemployment rate.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Choosing an SRS from a roster.}\nYou want an SRS of 5 students from a class roster.\nDescribe precisely how you would label students and use a random-digit source to select 5 distinct labels (show how you handle invalid labels and repeats).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Random digits: where to start.}\nIf you repeatedly use a fixed digit table, why is it a bad idea to always start reading at the same line/position?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Random digits: true/false with justification.}\nDecide whether each statement about random digits is true or false, and briefly justify.\n(a) ``Each row must contain exactly four 0s if it is random.''\n(b) ``Any specific two-digit block (like 00) has probability $1/100$.''\n(c) ``The block 0000 cannot appear because it looks non-random.''\n\n\\item \\textbf{Factory quality check (iPhones).}\nA factory produces 1{,}000 phones in a day. Managers want to inspect 20 phones.\n(a) Why can it be difficult to get an SRS of 20 in this setting?\n(b) Why is inspecting the \\emph{last} 20 phones a bad idea?\n(c) Another plan is to inspect every 50th phone. Explain why this is not an SRS.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Is it an SRS? (equal individual chance is not enough).}\nA company has 2{,}000 male and 500 female engineers. It takes a stratified sample of 200 males and 50 females, so each engineer has probability $1/10$ of selection.\nIs this sample an SRS? Explain carefully.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Systematic sampling: equal chance but not SRS.}\nA systematic method chooses a random start in the first $k$ items, then takes every $k$-th item.\nExplain why each individual can have equal selection probability, yet the method is not an SRS.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Undercoverage from a sampling frame.}\nA survey samples households using a telephone directory as the frame.\nExplain how undercoverage can occur and how it might bias results.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Nonresponse rate and bias direction.}\nA survey makes 45{,}956 calls and completes 5{,}029 interviews.\n(a) Compute the nonresponse rate.\n(b) Give a plausible way nonresponse could bias an estimate of \\emph{average miles driven per day}, and state the likely direction.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Wording bias.}\nFor each proposed question, comment on whether it is clear and whether it is slanted toward a desired response. If problematic, rewrite it neutrally.\n(You may use examples involving emotionally loaded facts, multi-claim prompts, or heavy jargon.)\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":202,"end_ix":233,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf","id":"file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70","source":"my_files","text":"DEFINITION:

In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L7] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L8] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L9] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L10] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L11] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L12] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L13] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L14] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L15] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L16] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L17] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L18] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L19] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L20] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L21] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L22] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L23] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L24] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L25] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L26] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L27] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L28] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L29] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L30] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L31] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L32] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L33] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L34] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L35] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L36] results of the earlier observational studies. The moral of the story is simple: beware \r\n[L37] the lurking variable!\r\n[L38] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L39] 1. Does reducing screen brightness increase battery life in laptop computers?

They control the effects of some outside \r\n[L8] variables by bringing those variables into the experiment to form the blocks. \r\n[L9] A randomized block design allows us to draw separate conclusions about each \r\n[L10] block, for example, about light-colored and dark-colored clothes in the laundry \r\n[L11] experiment. Blocking also allows more precise overall conclusions, because the <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 43 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 44 / 75>248 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L12] systematic differences between light- and dark-colored clothes can be removed \r\n[L13] when we study the overall effects of using this detergent in warm and cold \r\n[L14] water.\r\n[L15] The idea of blocking is an important additional principle of experimental \r\n[L16] design. A wise experimenter will form blocks based on the most important un\ufffeavoidable sources of variability (lurking variables) among the experimental units. \r\n[L17] Randomization will then average out the effects of the remaining lurking vari\ufffeables and allow an unbiased comparison of the treatments. The moral of the story \r\n[L18] is: control what you can, block on what you can\u2019t control, and randomize to create \r\n[L19] comparable groups.\r\n[L20] AP EXAM TIP Don\u2019t mix the \r\n[L21] language of experiments and the \r\n[L22] language of sample surveys or \r\n[L23] other observational studies.

The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L3] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L4] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L5] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L6] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L7] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L8] Matched pairs design\r\n[L9] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L10] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L11] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L12] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L13] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L14] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L15] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L16] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L17] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L18] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L19] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L20] groups of 60 using a similar process.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L28] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L29] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L30] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L31] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L32] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L33] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L34] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L35] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L36] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L37] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L38] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L39] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L40] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L41] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L42] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L43] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L44] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L45] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L46] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L47] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L48] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L49] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L50] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L51] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L52] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L53] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L54] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L55] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L56] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\n# \u30104\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn6file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"6:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L2] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L3] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L4] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L5] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L6] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment. Follow the model of \r\n[L7] Figure 4.4.\r\n[L8] 2. Describe how you would carry out the random assignment. Provide enough detail that \r\n[L9] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L10] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L11] Three Principles of \r\n[L12] Experimental Design\r\n[L13] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L14] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L15] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L16] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L17] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L18] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L19] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L20] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L21] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L22] ?\r\n[L23] THINK\r\n[L24] ABOUT\r\n[L25] IT<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L26] EXAMPLE\r\n[L27] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L28] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L29] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L30] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L31] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L32] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L33] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L34] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L35] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L36] between the groups.\r\n[L37] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L38] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L39] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L40] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L41] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L42] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L43] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L44] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L45] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L46] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L47] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L48] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L49] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L50] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L51] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L52] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L53] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L54] experiment.\r\n[L55] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L56] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L57] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks?\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a60d05555b4a86b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_42.jpg","size_bytes":45738,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://4b105e7c3a7bc6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_43.jpg","size_bytes":47864,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d19bf42557d3861#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_44.jpg","size_bytes":57481,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null}],"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":6,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["files_uploaded_in_conversation"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"f10d4ce8-caa2-4d66-a092-417944dd450f","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"748249b7-1b2a-4171-bad5-4415e2990acc","turn_exchange_id":"0b2f7492-d233-45d6-93be-d7c7c1b89171"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"748249b7-1b2a-4171-bad5-4415e2990acc","children":["0efff376-e963-481d-97a4-ba880c689e4e"]},"0efff376-e963-481d-97a4-ba880c689e4e":{"id":"0efff376-e963-481d-97a4-ba880c689e4e","message":{"id":"0efff376-e963-481d-97a4-ba880c689e4e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768712236.930144,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Expanding search for definitions and concepts","content":"I need to get more definitions related to treatment, experimental units, subjects, and designs like placebo and randomization.

Some doc\ufffetors have begun to use magnets to treat patients with chronic pain. Scientists wondered \r\n[L9] whether this type of therapy really worked. They designed a study to find out.\r\n[L10] Fifty patients with chronic pain were recruited for the study. A doctor identified a painful \r\n[L11] site on each patient and asked him or her to rate the pain on a scale from 0 (mild pain) to \r\n[L12] 10 (severe pain). Then, the doctor selected a sealed envelope containing a magnet from a \r\n[L13] box that contained both active and inactive magnets. That way, neither the doctor nor the \r\n[L14] patient knew which type of magnet was being used. The chosen magnet was applied to \r\n[L15] the site of the pain for 45 minutes. After \u201ctreatment,\u201d each patient was again asked to rate \r\n[L16] the level of pain from 0 to 10.\r\n[L17] In all, 29 patients were given active magnets and 21 patients received inactive magnets. \r\n[L18] All but one of the patients rated their initial pain as an 8, 9, or 10.

Here are \r\n[L26] some examples:\r\n[L27] sThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\n[L28] seat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\n[L29] sAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\n[L30] an average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\n[L31] teens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\n[L32] unsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\n[L33] sA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\n[L34] of catching a cold.4\r\n[L35] sFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\n[L36] that listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\n[L37] Can we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\n[L38] depends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\n[L39] look at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\n[L40] Each year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\n[L41] vehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\n[L42] people in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\n[L43] of an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\n[L44] asking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\n[L45] conducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\n[L46] about some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\n[L47] In the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\n[L48] questions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\n[L49] them a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\n[L50] observational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\n[L51] drawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\n[L52] while listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\n[L53] list of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\n[L54] The goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\n[L55] changes in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\n[L56] the ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\n[L57] Here\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\n[L58] ACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\n[L59] MATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\n[L60] clock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\n[L61] Confucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget.

Student A will \r\n[L100] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L101] 6. Your teacher will scale and label axes on the board for parallel dotplots of the re\ufffesults. Plot the number of pairs you remembered correctly on the appropriate graph.\r\n[L102] 7. Did students in your class remember numbers better when they saw them or \r\n[L103] when they heard them? Give appropriate evidence to support your answer.\r\n[L104] 8. Based on the results of this experiment, can we conclude that people in gen\ufffeeral remember better when they see than when they hear? Why or why not?\r\n[L105] DEFINITION: Population and sample\r\n[L106] The population in a statistical study is the entire group of individuals about which we \r\n[L107] want information.\r\n[L108] A sample is the part of the population from which we actually collect information. We \r\n[L109] use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\n[L110] The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\n[L111] sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\n[L112] Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\n[L113] uses of sampling.","[L114] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L115] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","[L116] 208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L117] EXAMPLE\r\n[L118] EXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\n[L119] Populations and samples\r\n[L120] PROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n[L121] (a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\n[L122] before shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\n[L123] five pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\n[L124] moisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n[L125] (b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\n[L126] SOLUTION:\r\n[L127] (a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\n[L128] that are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n[L129] (b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\n[L130] For Practice Try Exercise 1\r\n[L131] The Idea of a Sample Survey\r\n[L132] We often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\n[L133] basis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\n[L134] and ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\n[L135] cream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\n[L136] whole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\n[L137] varied population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\n[L138] The first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\n[L139] what population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\n[L140] exactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\n[L141] We reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\n[L142] example. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\n[L143] or \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\n[L144] or more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example. We\u2019ll avoid this more \r\n[L145] restrictive terminology.\r\n[L146] Sample survey\r\n[L147] How Does the Current Population Survey Work?\r\n[L148] A sample survey\r\n[L149] One of the most important government sample surveys in the United States is \r\n[L150] the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS contacts about 60,000 \r\n[L151] households each month. It produces the monthly unemployment rate and much ","[L152] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://78b0ae7eaeb088a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":58525,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L153] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>","[L154] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 209\r\n[L155] The final step in planning a sample survey is to decide how to choose a sample \r\n[L156] from the population. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some good and not-so-good sam\ufffepling methods.\r\n[L157] How to Sample Badly\r\n[L158] How can we choose a sample that we can trust to represent the population? \r\n[L159] The easiest\u2014but not the best\u2014sampling method just chooses individuals who \r\n[L160] are close by. Suppose we\u2019re interested in finding out how long students at a \r\n[L161] large high school spent on homework last week, for example. We might go to \r\n[L162] the school library and ask the first 30 students we see about their homework \r\n[L163] time. A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\n[L164] easiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\n[L165] produce unrepresentative data.\r\n[L166] other economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\n[L167] specify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\n[L168] all U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\n[L169] not in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\n[L170] news refers to this specific population.\r\n[L171] What does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\n[L172] for example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\n[L173] she is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\n[L174] first asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\n[L175] work in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\n[L176] you are not in the labor force.\r\n[L177] If you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\n[L178] you did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\n[L179] you are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\n[L180] pay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\n[L181] because of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason. An unemployment rate \r\n[L182] of 9.7% means that 9.7% of the sample was unemployed, using the exact CPS \r\n[L183] definitions of both \u201clabor force\u201d and \u201cunemployed.\u201d\r\n[L184] DEFINITION: Convenience sample\r\n[L185] Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach results in a convenience sample.\r\n[L186] What\u2019s wrong with our convenience sample of students in the library? It\u2019s \r\n[L187] unlikely that this sample represents the homework habits of all students at the \r\n[L188] school well. In fact, we\u2019d expect the sample to overestimate the average homework \r\n[L189] time in the population since students who hang out in the library might tend to \r\n[L190] be more studious. This is bias: using a method that will consistently overestimate \r\n[L191] or underestimate the value you want to know.","[L192] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bea60ae105051c9#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_4.jpg","size_bytes":53957,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L193] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>","[L194] 210 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L195] EXAMPLE\r\n[L196] DEFINITION: Bias\r\n[L197] The design of a statistical study shows bias if it systematically favors certain outcomes.\r\n[L198] Convenience samples are almost guaranteed to show bias. So are voluntary \r\n[L199] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L200] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L201] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L202] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L203] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L204] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L205] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L206] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L207] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L208] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L209] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L210] to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\n[L211] Illegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\n[L212] Online polls\r\n[L213] Former CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\n[L214] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L215] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L216] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L217] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L218] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L219] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L220] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L221] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L222] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L223] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L224] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L225] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L226] the direction of the bias. Suppose you were asked, \u201cExplain how using a convenience sample of students in \r\n[L227] your statistics class to estimate the proportion of all high school students who own a graphing calculator could \r\n[L228] result in bias.\u201d You might respond, \u201cThis sample would probably include a much higher proportion of students \r\n[L229] with a graphing calculator than in the population at large because a graphing calculator is required for the \r\n[L230] statistics class.

In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L247] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L248] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L249] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L250] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L251] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L252] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L253] random sample.\r\n[L254] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L255] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L256] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L257] sample actually selected.\r\n[L258] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L259] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L260] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L261] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L262] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L263] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L264] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L265] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L266] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L267] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L268] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L269] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L270] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L271] if the population is large. Think about the \r\n[L272] Current Population Survey, for example, \r\n[L273] Random sampling","[L274] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://3a54b1107c99c35#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_6.jpg","size_bytes":57187,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L275] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>","[L276] 212 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L277] which must draw a sample of size 60,000 every month from the population of \r\n[L278] over 117 million U.S. households.\r\n[L279] In practice, people use random numbers generated by a computer or calcula\ufffetor to choose samples. If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L280] random digits.\r\n[L281] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L282] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L283] these properties:\r\n[L284] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L285] s The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\n[L286] gives no information about any other part.\r\n[L287] Table D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\n[L288] digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\n[L289] in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\n[L290] the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\n[L291] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L292] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L293] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L294] same length.\r\n[L295] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L296] from Table D.\r\n[L297] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L298] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L299] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L300] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L301] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L302] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L303] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L304] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L305] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L306] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L307] and so on\u2014because the table has no order.

Use the map shown to choose a sample of 5 states to \r\n[L382] estimate the average (mean) land area. You have \r\n[L383] 15 seconds.\r\n[L384] 2. Refer to the table of land areas on page N/DS-5.

What \r\n[L394] advantage(s) does random sampling provide?\r\n[L395] There\u2019s an important difference between the samples produced by the Simple\r\n[L396] Random Sample applet and the calculator\u2019s randInt command in the Technol\ufffeogy Corner. The applet sampled without replacement from the \u201cPopulation hop\ufffeper,\u201d but the calculator sampled with replacement from the specified population. \r\n[L397] As a result, the calculator sometimes selects the same number more than once in \r\n[L398] a given sample. To deal with this problem, you can generate additional random \r\n[L399] numbers as needed to replace any repeats. Or you can use a method other than \r\n[L400] randInt (like randSamp on the TI-Nspire) to sample without replacement. Refer \r\n[L401] to your device\u2019s reference manual or ask your teacher.\r\n[L402] We can trust results from an SRS, as well as from other types of random samples \r\n[L403] that we will meet later, because the use of impersonal chance avoids bias. Online\r\n[L404] and call-in polls also produce samples. But we can\u2019t trust results from these sam\ufffeples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. The first question to ask about \r\n[L405] any sample is whether it was chosen at random.\r\n[L406] Other Sampling Methods\r\n[L407] The basic idea of sampling is straightforward: take an SRS from the population \r\n[L408] and use your sample results to gain information about the population. Unfor\ufffetunately, it\u2019s usually very difficult to actually get an SRS from the population of \r\n[L409] interest. Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L410] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L411] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L412] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L413] selected. Sometimes, there are also statistical advantages to using more complex \r\n[L414] sampling methods.","[L415] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 11 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://10ecedd5bee1a96#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_10.jpg","size_bytes":60902,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L416] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 75>","[L417] 216 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L418] One of the most common alternatives to an SRS involves sampling important \r\n[L419] groups (called strata) within the population separately. Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L420] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L421] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L422] between strata.\r\n[L423] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L424] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L425] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L426] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L427] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L428] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L429] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L430] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L431] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size. Not convinced? Try \r\n[L432] the following Activity.\r\n[L433] ACTIVITY Sampling sunflowers\r\n[L434] A British farmer grows sunflowers for making sunflower oil. Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L435] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L436] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L437] money she\u2019ll make from selling them. It would take too much time to \r\n[L438] count the plants in all 100 squares, so she\u2019ll accept an estimate based on \r\n[L439] a sample of 10 squares.\r\n[L440] 1. Use Table D or technology to take a simple random sample of 10 \r\n[L441] grid squares. Record the location (for example, B6) of each square you \r\n[L442] select.\r\n[L443] 2. This time, you\u2019ll take a stratified random sample using the \r\n[L444] rows as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select \r\n[L445] one square from each (horizontal) row. Record the location of \r\n[L446] each square.\r\n[L447] 3. Now, take a stratified random sample using the columns\r\n[L448] as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select one \r\n[L449] square from each (vertical) column. Record the location of \r\n[L450] each square.\r\n[L451] 4. The table on page N/DS-6 gives the actual number of \r\n[L452] sunflowers in each grid square.

Your teacher will provide you with the mean number of sunflowers in the popu\ufffelation of all 100 grid squares in the field. How did the three sampling methods do?\r\n[L472] The following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\n[L473] in the music business.\r\n[L474] Who Wrote That Song?\r\n[L475] Using a stratified random sample\r\n[L476] A radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\n[L477] The organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\n[L478] members by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\n[L479] ASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\n[L480] year. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L481] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L482] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L483] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L484] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L485] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L486] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L487] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L488] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L489] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L490] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L491] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L492] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L493] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups. Ideally, these \r\n[L494] clusters should mirror the characteristics of the population. Then choose an SRS of the \r\n[L495] clusters. All individuals in the chosen clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L496] Imagine a large high school that assigns its students to homerooms alphabeti\ufffecally by last name. The school administration is considering a new schedule and \r\n[L497] would like student input. Administrators decide to survey 200 randomly selected \r\n[L498] students.

They don\u2019t offer the statistical advantage of better information about the \r\n[L507] population that stratified random samples do. That\u2019s because clusters are often \r\n[L508] chosen for ease or convenience, so they may have as much variability as the popu\ufffelation itself. Be sure you understand the difference between strata and clusters. \r\n[L509] We want each stratum to contain similar individuals, and for there to be large \r\n[L510] differences between strata. For a cluster sample, we\u2019d like each cluster to look just \r\n[L511] like the population, but on a smaller scale.\r\n[L512] Sampling at a School Assembly\r\n[L513] Strata or clusters?\r\n[L514] The student council wants to conduct a survey during the first \r\n[L515] five minutes of an all-school assembly in the auditorium about \r\n[L516] use of the school library.

Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L619] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L620] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L621] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L622] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L623] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L624] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L625] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L626] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L627] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L628] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L629] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L630] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L631] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L632] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L633] Sampling Units, or PSUs. Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\n[L634] the 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\n[L635] of the others.\r\n[L636] Stage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\n[L637] Stratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\n[L638] Stage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\n[L639] units. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\n[L640] Analyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\n[L641] beyond basic statistics.

The \r\n[L666] process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\n[L667] called inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\n[L668] we know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\n[L669] response samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\n[L670] the population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\n[L671] selecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\n[L672] Still, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\n[L673] the entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\n[L674] the monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\n[L675] population. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\n[L676] almost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\n[L677] Inference\r\n[L678] ACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\n[L679] MATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\n[L680] other container that students can\u2019t see through\r\n[L681] In this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\n[L682] in relation to the population truth.\r\n[L683] 1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\n[L684] particular color.\r\n[L685] 2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\n[L686] record the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\n[L687] returned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n[L688] 3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\n[L689] is the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\n[L690] center? Is there a clear shape?\r\n[L691] Why can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\n[L692] results of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\n[L693] Because we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\n[L694] govern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\n[L695] results are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\n[L696] random sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\n[L697] the population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\n[L698] sets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\n[L699] for sampling later.\r\n[L700] One point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples.

By taking a very large \r\n[L706] sample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\n[L707] about the population.\r\n[L708] The Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\n[L709] expect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\n[L710] of the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n[L711] 3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\n[L712] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L713] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L714] clicked a response.\r\n[L715] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L716] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L717] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L718] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L719] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L720] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L721] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L722] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L723] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L724] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L725] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L726] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L727] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L728] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L729] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L730] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L731] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L732] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L733] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L734] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L735] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L736] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L737] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L738] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L739] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L740] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L741] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L742] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L743] Sampling frame","[L744] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L745] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","[L746] 222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L747] EXAMPLE\r\n[L748] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L749] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L750] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L751] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L752] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L753] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L754] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L755] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L756] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L757] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L758] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L759] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L760] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L761] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L762] refuses to participate.\r\n[L763] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L764] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L765] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L766] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L767] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L768] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L769] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L770] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L771] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L772] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L773] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L774] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L775] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L776] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L777] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L778] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L779] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","[L780] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L781] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","[L782] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L783] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L784] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L785] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L786] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L787] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L788] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L789] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L790] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L791] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L792] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L793] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L794] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L795] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L796] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L797] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L798] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L799] memory. \u201cHave you visited a dentist in the last 6 months?\u201d will often draw a \r\n[L800] \u201cYes\u201d from someone who last visited a dentist 8 months ago.10 Careful training \r\n[L801] of interviewers and careful supervision to avoid variation among the interview\ufffeers can reduce response bias.

Confusing or leading questions can introduce strong bias, and \r\n[L809] changes in wording can greatly change a survey\u2019s outcome. Even the order in \r\n[L810] which questions are asked matters.\r\n[L811] How Do Americans Feel about Illegal Immigrants?\r\n[L812] Question wording matters\r\n[L813] \u201cShould illegal immigrants be prosecuted and deported for being in the U.S. illegally, \r\n[L814] or shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Asked this question in an opinion poll, 69% favored deportation. \r\n[L815] But when the very same sample was asked whether illegal immigrants who have \r\n[L816] worked in the United States for two years \u201cshould be given a chance to keep their jobs \r\n[L817] and eventually apply for legal status,\u201d 62% said that they should. Different questions \r\n[L818] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L819] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L820] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L821] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L822] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L823] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L824] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L825] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L826] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L827] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L828] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L829] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L830] 1.

A survey paid for by makers of disposable diapers found that 84% of the sample opposed \r\n[L836] banning disposable diapers.

In contrast, beverage containers, third-class mail and yard wastes are estimated\r\n[L839] to account for about 21% of the trash in landfills.

It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L853] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L854] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L855] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L856] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L857] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L858] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L859] process.\r\n[L860] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L861] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L862] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L863] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L864] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L865] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L866] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L867] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L868] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L869] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L870] prone to large bias.\r\n[L871] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L872] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L873] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L874] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L875] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L876] errors.

Sampling the forest To gather data on a 1200-acre \r\n[L1013] pine forest in Louisiana, the U.S. Forest Service laid a \r\n[L1014] grid of 1410 equally spaced circular plots over a map \r\n[L1015] of the forest. A ground survey visited a sample of 10% \r\n[L1016] of these plots.12\r\n[L1017] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table D \r\n[L1018] to choose an SRS of 141 plots. Your description should \r\n[L1019] be clear enough for a classmate to obtain your results.\r\n[L1020] (b) Use your method from (a) to choose the first \r\n[L1021] 3 plots.\r\n[L1022] 14. Sampling gravestones The local genealogical society \r\n[L1023] in Coles County, Illinois, has compiled records on all \r\n[L1024] 55,914 gravestones in cemeteries in the county for the \r\n[L1025] years 1825 to 1985. Historians plan to use these records \r\n[L1026] to learn about African Americans in Coles County\u2019s his\ufffetory. They first choose an SRS of 395 records to check \r\n[L1027] their accuracy by visiting the actual gravestones.13\r\n[L1028] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table \r\n[L1029] D to choose the SRS. Your description should be \r\n[L1030] clear enough for a classmate to obtain your results.\r\n[L1031] (b) Use your method from (a) to choose the first \r\n[L1032] 3 gravestones.\r\n[L1033] 15. Random digits In using Table D repeatedly to \r\n[L1034] choose random samples, you should not always begin \r\n[L1035] at the same place, such as line 101. Why not?\r\n[L1036] 16. Random digits Which of the following statements \r\n[L1037] are true of a table of random digits, and which are \r\n[L1038] false? Briefly explain your answers.\r\n[L1039] (a) There are exactly four 0s in each row of 40 digits.\r\n[L1040] (b) Each pair of digits has chance 1/100 of being 00.\r\n[L1041] (c) The digits 0000 can never appear as a group, \r\n[L1042] because this pattern is not random.\r\n[L1043] 17. iPhones Suppose 1000 iPhones are produced at a \r\n[L1044] factory today. Management would like to ensure \r\n[L1045] that the phones\u2019 display screens meet their quality \r\n[L1046] standards before shipping them to retail stores. Since \r\n[L1047] it takes about 10 minutes to inspect an individual \r\n[L1048] phone\u2019s display screen, managers decide to inspect a \r\n[L1049] sample of 20 phones from the day\u2019s production.\r\n[L1050] (a) Explain why it would be difficult for managers to \r\n[L1051] inspect an SRS of 20 iPhones that are produced today.\r\n[L1052] (b) An eager employee suggests that it would be easy \r\n[L1053] to inspect the last 20 iPhones that were produced \r\n[L1054] today. Why isn\u2019t this a good idea?\r\n[L1055] (c) Another employee recommends inspecting every \r\n[L1056] fiftieth iPhone that is produced. Explain carefully \r\n[L1057] why this sampling method is not an SRS.\r\n[L1058] 18. Dead trees On the west side of Rocky Mountain \r\n[L1059] National Park, many mature pine trees are dying due \r\n[L1060] to infestation by pine beetles. Scientists would like to \r\n[L1061] use sampling to estimate the proportion of all pine \r\n[L1062] trees in the area that have been infected.\r\n[L1063] (a) Explain why it wouldn\u2019t be practical for scientists \r\n[L1064] to obtain an SRS in this setting.\r\n[L1065] (b) A possible alternative would be to use every pine \r\n[L1066] tree along the park\u2019s main road as a sample. Why is \r\n[L1067] this sampling method biased?\r\n[L1068] (c) Suppose that a more complicated random sam\ufffepling plan is carried out, and that 35% of the pine trees \r\n[L1069] in the sample are infested by the pine beetle. Can \r\n[L1070] scientists conclude that 35% of all the pine trees on the \r\n[L1071] west side of the park are infested? Why or why not?\r\n[L1072] 19. Who goes to the convention? A club has 30 student \r\n[L1073] members and 10 faculty members. The students are\r\n[L1074] Abel Fisher Huber Miranda Reinmann\r\n[L1075] Carson Ghosh Jimenez Moskowitz Santos\r\n[L1076] Chen Griswold Jones Neyman Shaw\r\n[L1077] David Hein Kim O\u2019Brien Thompson\r\n[L1078] Deming Hernandez Klotz Pearl Utts\r\n[L1079] Elashoff Holland Liu Potter Varga\r\n[L1080] The faculty members are\r\n[L1081] Andrews Fernandez Kim Moore West\r\n[L1082] Besicovitch Gupta Lightman Phillips Yang","[L1083] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>","[L1084] 228 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1085] The club can send 4 students and 2 faculty members \r\n[L1086] to a convention. It decides to choose those who will \r\n[L1087] go by random selection. How will you label the two \r\n[L1088] strata? Use Table D, beginning at line 123, to choose \r\n[L1089] a stratified random sample of 4 students and 2 faculty \r\n[L1090] members.\r\n[L1091] 20. Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\n[L1092] stratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\n[L1093] records of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\n[L1094] stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\n[L1095] and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\n[L1096] One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\n[L1097] these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\n[L1098] amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000. Using these \r\n[L1099] groups as strata, you decide to verify all the largest \r\n[L1100] accounts and to sample 5% of the midsize accounts \r\n[L1101] and 1% of the small accounts. How would you label \r\n[L1102] the two strata from which you will sample? Use Table \r\n[L1103] D, starting at line 115, to select only the first 3 \r\n[L1104] accounts from each of these strata.\r\n[L1105] 21. Go Blue! Michigan Stadium, also known as \u201cThe Big \r\n[L1106] House,\u201d seats over 100,000 fans for a football game. \r\n[L1107] The University of Michigan athletic department plans \r\n[L1108] to conduct a survey about concessions that are sold \r\n[L1109] during games. Tickets are most expensive for seats \r\n[L1110] near the field and on the sideline. The cheapest seats \r\n[L1111] are high up in the end zones (where one of the au\ufffethors sat as a student). A map of the stadium is shown.\r\n[L1112] Visitor Sideline\r\n[L1113] Michigan Sideline\r\n[L1114] Sideline PRESS BOX ENDZONE\r\n[L1115] ENDZONE\r\n[L1116] 41 42 40\r\n[L1117] 39\r\n[L1118] 43 44 1 2 3 4 5 6\r\n[L1119] 7\r\n[L1120] 27 26 28\r\n[L1121] 29\r\n[L1122] 25\r\n[L1123] 35\r\n[L1124] 34\r\n[L1125] 33\r\n[L1126] 32\r\n[L1127] 31\r\n[L1128] 30\r\n[L1129] 36\r\n[L1130] 37\r\n[L1131] 38\r\n[L1132] 11\r\n[L1133] 12\r\n[L1134] 13\r\n[L1135] 14\r\n[L1136] 15\r\n[L1137] 16\r\n[L1138] 10\r\n[L1139] 9\r\n[L1140] 8\r\n[L1141] 24 23 22 21 20 19 18\r\n[L1142] 17\r\n[L1143] Corner\r\n[L1144] Endzone\r\n[L1145] (a) The athletic department is considering a stratified \r\n[L1146] random sample. What would you recommend as the \r\n[L1147] strata? Why?\r\n[L1148] (b) Explain why a cluster sample might be easier to \r\n[L1149] obtain. What would you recommend for the clusters? \r\n[L1150] Why?\r\n[L1151] 22. How was your stay? A hotel has 30 floors with 40 \r\n[L1152] rooms per floor. The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L1153] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L1154] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L1155] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L1156] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L1157] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L1158] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L1159] might be preferable to an SRS in this case. What \r\n[L1160] would you use as strata?\r\n[L1161] (b) Why might a cluster sample be a simpler option? \r\n[L1162] What would you use as clusters?\r\n[L1163] 23. Is it an SRS? A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L1164] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L1165] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L1166] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L1167] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L1168] Explain your answer.\r\n[L1169] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L1170] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L1171] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L1172] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L1173] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L1174] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L1175] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L1176] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L1177] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L1178] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L1179] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L1180] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L1181] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L1182] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L1183] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L1184] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L1185] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L1186] method?\r\n[L1187] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L1188] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L1189] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L1190] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L1191] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L1192] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L1193] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L1194] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1195] sample.\r\n[L1196] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L1197] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L1198] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L1199] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L1200] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L1201] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L1202] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L1203] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L1204] pg 218","[L1205] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1206] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","[L1207] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L1208] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1209] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200. Enter the \r\n[L1210] table at line 120.\r\n[L1211] (b) Like an SRS, a systematic random sample gives \r\n[L1212] all individuals the same chance to be chosen. Explain \r\n[L1213] why this is true. Then explain carefully why a system\ufffeatic sample is not an SRS.\r\n[L1214] 27. Sampling frame Ideally, the sampling frame in a \r\n[L1215] sample survey should list every individual in the \r\n[L1216] population, but in practice, this is often difficult. \r\n[L1217] Suppose that a sample of households in a community \r\n[L1218] is selected at random from the telephone directory. \r\n[L1219] Explain how this sampling method results in under\ufffecoverage that could lead to bias.\r\n[L1220] 28. Sampling frame Refer to the previous exercise. It is \r\n[L1221] more common in telephone surveys to use random \r\n[L1222] digit dialing equipment that selects the last four digits \r\n[L1223] of a telephone number at random after being given \r\n[L1224] the exchange (the first three digits). Explain how this \r\n[L1225] sampling method results in undercoverage that could \r\n[L1226] lead to bias.\r\n[L1227] 29. Baseball tickets Suppose you want to know the \r\n[L1228] average amount of money spent by the fans attending \r\n[L1229] opening day for the Cleveland Indians baseball sea\ufffeson. You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\n[L1230] to conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\n[L1231] allow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\n[L1232] seats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\n[L1233] you randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\n[L1234] stadium. During the game, you ask the fans in those \r\n[L1235] seats how much they spent that day.\r\n[L1236] (a) Provide a reason why this survey might yield a \r\n[L1237] biased result.\r\n[L1238] (b) Explain whether the reason you provided in (a) is \r\n[L1239] a sampling error or a nonsampling error.\r\n[L1240] 30. What kind of error? Which of the following are \r\n[L1241] sources of sampling error and which are sources of \r\n[L1242] nonsampling error? Explain your answers.\r\n[L1243] (a) The subject lies about past drug use.\r\n[L1244] (b) A typing error is made in recording the data.\r\n[L1245] (c) Data are gathered by asking people to mail in a \r\n[L1246] coupon printed in a newspaper.\r\n[L1247] 31. Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\n[L1248] sampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\n[L1249] the United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n[L1250] 5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\n[L1251] estimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n[L1252] (a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n[L1253] (b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\n[L1254] survey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n[L1255] 32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\n[L1256] in telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\n[L1257] call is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\n[L1258] The Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\n[L1259] nonresponse to a government survey of households \r\n[L1260] in Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\n[L1261] July 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\n[L1262] and 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\n[L1263] period versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\n[L1264] period.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\n[L1265] rate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\n[L1266] nonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n[L1267] 33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n[L1268] 31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\n[L1269] answer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\n[L1270] drove through, how many of them were red when you \r\n[L1271] entered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n[L1272] 171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\n[L1273] practical problem with this survey is that people may \r\n[L1274] not give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\n[L1275] of the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n[L1276] 880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n[L1277] 34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\n[L1278] belt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\n[L1279] chosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\n[L1280] they were invited to answer questions that included \r\n[L1281] questions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\n[L1282] always used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\n[L1283] seat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\n[L1284] lots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey. Do you expect bias in the same \r\n[L1285] direction in most surveys about seat belt use?\r\n[L1286] 35. Wording bias Comment on each of the following \r\n[L1287] as a potential sample survey question. Is the question \r\n[L1288] clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1289] (a) \u201cSome cell phone users have developed brain \r\n[L1290] cancer. Should all cell phones come with a warning \r\n[L1291] label explaining the danger of using cell phones?\u201d\r\n[L1292] (b) \u201cDo you agree that a national system of health \r\n[L1293] insurance should be favored because it would provide \r\n[L1294] health insurance for everyone and would reduce \r\n[L1295] administrative costs?\u201d\r\n[L1296] (c) \u201cIn view of escalating environmental degradation \r\n[L1297] and incipient resource depletion, would you favor \r\n[L1298] economic incentives for recycling of resource\ufffeintensive consumer goods?\u201d\r\n[L1299] 36. Checking for bias Comment on each of the fol\ufffelowing as a potential sample survey question. Is the \r\n[L1300] question clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1301] (a) Which of the following best represents your \r\n[L1302] opinion on gun control?\r\n[L1303] 1.

Sample surveys are one kind of observational\r\n[L1406] study. Other observational studies watch the behavior of animals in the wild or the \r\n[L1407] interactions between teacher and students in the classroom. This section is about \r\n[L1408] statistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\n[L1409] Observational Study versus Experiment\r\n[L1410] In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\n[L1411] ask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\n[L1412] response. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\n[L1413] of a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\n[L1414] DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\n[L1415] An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\n[L1416] does not attempt to influence the responses.\r\n[L1417] An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\n[L1418] responses.\r\n[L1419] The goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\n[L1420] to compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\n[L1421] of an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\n[L1422] response. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\n[L1423] way to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\n[L1424] see the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\n[L1425] is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\n[L1426] data. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\n[L1427] is one of the most important in statistics.\r\n[L1428] Does Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\n[L1429] after Menopause?\r\n[L1430] Observation versus experiment\r\n[L1431] Should women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\n[L1432] production of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\n[L1433] a heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\n[L1434] small compared with the benefits.\r\n[L1435] The evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\n[L1436] hormones with others who were not. But the women who chose to \r\n[L1437] take hormones were richer and better educated and saw doctors \r\n[L1438] more often than women who didn\u2019t take hormones.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L1466] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L1467] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L1468] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L1469] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L1470] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L1471] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L1472] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L1473] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L1474] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L1475] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L1476] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L1477] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L1478] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L1479] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L1480] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L1481] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L1482] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L1483] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L1484] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L1485] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L1486] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L1487] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L1488] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L1489] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L1490] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L1491] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L1492] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L1493] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L1494] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L1495] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L1496] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L1497] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","[L1498] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1499] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","[L1500] Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L1501] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L1502] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L1503] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L1504] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L1505] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L1506] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L1507] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L1508] results of the earlier observational studies.

Here is the basic vocabulary of experiments.\r\n[L1526] DEFINITION: Treatment, experimental units, subjects\r\n[L1527] A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment.\r\n[L1528] If an experiment has several explanatory variables, a treatment is a combination of \r\n[L1529] specific values of these variables.\r\n[L1530] The experimental units are the smallest collection of individuals to which treatments \r\n[L1531] are applied. When the units are human beings, they often are called subjects.\r\n[L1532] The best way to learn the language of experiments is to practice using it.\r\n[L1533] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1534] are asked to identify a \r\n[L1535] possible confounding \r\n[L1536] variable in a given \r\n[L1537] setting, you are \r\n[L1538] expected to explain how \r\n[L1539] the variable you choose \r\n[L1540] (1) is associated with \r\n[L1541] the explanatory variable \r\n[L1542] and (2) affects the \r\n[L1543] response variable.","[L1544] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1545] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>","[L1546] 234 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1547] EXAMPLE When Will I Ever Use This Stuff?\r\n[L1548] Vocabulary of experiments\r\n[L1549] Researchers at the University of North Carolina were concerned about the \r\n[L1550] increasing dropout rate in the state\u2019s high schools, especially for low-income stu\ufffedents. Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\n[L1551] started to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\n[L1552] To change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\n[L1553] the topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\n[L1554] To test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\n[L1555] the schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\n[L1556] standard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\n[L1557] curriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\n[L1558] years, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\n[L1559] scores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\n[L1560] high school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\n[L1561] greater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\n[L1562] PROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\n[L1563] in the CareerStart experiment.\r\n[L1564] SOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\n[L1565] variable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\n[L1566] compares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\n[L1567] behavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\n[L1568] The previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\n[L1569] trying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\n[L1570] all 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\n[L1571] of schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\n[L1572] researchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\n[L1573] systematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\n[L1574] students from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\n[L1575] program made the difference.\r\n[L1576] Sometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\n[L1577] experiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\n[L1578] treatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\n[L1579] the factors. Here\u2019s an example of a multifactor experiment.\r\n[L1580] Factors\r\n[L1581] Level\r\n[L1582] For Practice Try Exercise 51","[L1583] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://26b92d516ab78a7#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_29.jpg","size_bytes":63833,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1584] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>","[L1585] Section 4.2 Experiments 235\r\n[L1586] EXAMPLE TV Advertising\r\n[L1587] Experiments with multiple explanatory variables\r\n[L1588] What are the effects of repeated exposure to an advertising message? The answer \r\n[L1589] may depend on both the length of the ad and on how often it is repeat\ufffeed. An experiment investigated this question using undergraduate stu\ufffedents as subjects. All subjects viewed a 40-minute television program \r\n[L1590] that included ads for a digital camera. Some subjects saw a 30-second \r\n[L1591] commercial; others, a 90-second version. The same commercial was \r\n[L1592] shown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After viewing, all the \r\n[L1593] subjects answered questions about their recall of the ad, their attitude \r\n[L1594] toward the camera, and their intention to purchase it.21\r\n[L1595] PROBLEM: For the advertising study,\r\n[L1596] (a) identify the explanatory and response variables, and\r\n[L1597] (b) list all the treatments.\r\n[L1598] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1599] (a) This experiment has 2 explanatory variables (factors): \r\n[L1600] length of the commercial and number of repetitions. The response \r\n[L1601] variables include measures of subjects\u2019 recall of the ad, their \r\n[L1602] attitudes about the digital camera, and whether they intend to \r\n[L1603] purchase it.\r\n[L1604] (b) There are 2 different lengths of commercial (30 and 90 seconds) \r\n[L1605] and three different numbers of repetitions (1, 3, and 5). The 6 combi\ufffenations consisting of one level of each factor form the 6 treatments \r\n[L1606] shown in Figure 4.3: (1) 30 seconds, 1 time; (2) 30 seconds, 3 times; \r\n[L1607] (3) 30 seconds, 5 times; (4) 90 seconds, 1 time; (5) 90 seconds, \r\n[L1608] 3 times; (6) 90 seconds, 5 times.\r\n[L1609] This example shows how experiments allow us to study the combined effect of \r\n[L1610] several factors. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\n[L1611] not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\n[L1612] commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\n[L1613] interest. But if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers \r\n[L1614] get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. The two-factor experiment in \r\n[L1615] the TV advertising example will help us find out.\r\n[L1616] How to Experiment Badly \r\n[L1617] Experiments are the preferred method for examining the effect of one variable on \r\n[L1618] another. By imposing the specific treatment of interest and controlling other \r\n[L1619] influences, we can pin down cause and effect. Good designs are essential for \r\n[L1620] effective experiments, just as they are for sampling. To see why, let\u2019s start with an \r\n[L1621] example of a bad experimental design.\r\n[L1622] Factor A\r\n[L1623] Length\r\n[L1624] Factor B\r\n[L1625] Repetitions\r\n[L1626] 30\r\n[L1627] seconds 1 2 3\r\n[L1628] 90\r\n[L1629] seconds\r\n[L1630] 1 time 3 times 5 times\r\n[L1631] 4 5 6\r\n[L1632] Subjects assigned\r\n[L1633] to Treatment 3 see\r\n[L1634] a 30-second ad\r\n[L1635] five times during\r\n[L1636] the program.\r\n[L1637] For Practice Try Exercise 55\r\n[L1638] FIGURE 4.3 The six treatments in the TV ad experiment. \r\n[L1639] Combinations of values of the two explanatory variables \r\n[L1640] (factors) form six treatments.","[L1641] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bcf9a5dddba7c8b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":57574,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1642] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 75>","[L1643] 236 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1644] EXAMPLE Which Works Better: Online or In-Class \r\n[L1645] SAT Preparation?\r\n[L1646] A bad experiment\r\n[L1647] A high school regularly offers a review course to prepare students for \r\n[L1648] the SAT. This year, budget cuts will allow the school to offer only an \r\n[L1649] online version of the course. Over the past 10 years, the average SAT \r\n[L1650] score of students in the classroom course was 1620. The online group \r\n[L1651] gets an average score of 1780. That\u2019s roughly 10% higher than the long\ufffetime average for those who took the classroom review course. Is the \r\n[L1652] online course more effective?\r\n[L1653] This experiment has a very simple design. A group of subjects (the \r\n[L1654] students) were exposed to a treatment (the online course), and the \r\n[L1655] outcome (SAT scores) was observed. Here is the design:\r\n[L1656] Students \u2192 Online course \u2192 SAT scores\r\n[L1657] A closer look showed that the students in the online review course \r\n[L1658] were quite different from the students who took the classroom course \r\n[L1659] in past years. They had higher GPAs and were taking more AP classes.\r\n[L1660] The effect of online versus in-class instruction is mixed up with the \r\n[L1661] effect of these lurking variables. Maybe the online students earned \r\n[L1662] higher SAT scores because they were smarter to begin with, not \r\n[L1663] because the online course prepared them better. This confounding \r\n[L1664] prevents us from concluding that the online course is more effective than class\uffferoom instruction.\r\n[L1665] Many laboratory experiments use a design like the one in the online SAT course \r\n[L1666] example:\r\n[L1667] Experimental units \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Measure response\r\n[L1668] In the lab environment, simple designs often work well. Field experiments and \r\n[L1669] experiments with animals or people deal with more variable conditions.

Most well-designed experiments compare \r\n[L1675] two or more treatments.\r\n[L1676] Comparison alone isn\u2019t enough to produce results we can trust. If the treat\ufffements are given to groups that differ greatly when the experiment begins, bias will \r\n[L1677] result.

The solution to the problem of bias in sampling is \r\n[L1684] random selection. In experiments, the solution is random assignment.\r\n[L1685] DEFINITION: Random assignment\r\n[L1686] In an experiment, random assignment means that experimental units are assigned to \r\n[L1687] treatments at random, that is, using some sort of chance process.\r\n[L1688] Let\u2019s look at how random assignment can be used to improve the design of the \r\n[L1689] SAT prep course experiment.\r\n[L1690] SAT Prep: Online versus Classroom\r\n[L1691] How random assignment works\r\n[L1692] This year, the high school has enough budget money to compare the \r\n[L1693] online SAT course with traditional classroom instruction. Fifty students \r\n[L1694] have agreed to participate in an experiment comparing the two instruc\ufffetional methods.\r\n[L1695] PROBLEM: Describe how you would randomly assign 25 students to each of the two \r\n[L1696] methods:\r\n[L1697] (a) Using 50 identical slips of paper\r\n[L1698] (b) Using Table D\r\n[L1699] (c) Using technology\r\n[L1700] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1701] (a) The simplest way would be to use the \u201chat method.\u201d Write each subject\u2019s name on \r\n[L1702] one of the slips. Put all the slips in a hat and mix them thoroughly. Draw them out one \r\n[L1703] at a time until you have 25 slips. These 25 students will take the online course. The \r\n[L1704] remaining 25 students will take the classroom course. Alternatively, you could write \r\n[L1705] \u201conline\u201d on 25 of the slips and \u201cclassroom\u201d on the other 25 slips. Then put the slips in \r\n[L1706] a hat and mix them well. Have students come up one by one and (without looking) pick a slip from the \r\n[L1707] hat. This guarantees 25 students per group, with the treatments assigned by chance.\r\n[L1708] (b) We can use the two-step process from random sampling to do the random assignment.\r\n[L1709] Step 1: Label. Give labels 01, 02, 03, . . . , 49, 50 to the subjects in alphabetical order by last \r\n[L1710] name.\r\n[L1711] Step 2: Table. Go to a line of Table D and read two-digit groups moving from left to right. The first \r\n[L1712] 25 distinct labels between 01 and 50 that you encounter select the online group. The remaining \r\n[L1713] 25\u00a0students will take the classroom course. Ignore repeated labels and groups of digits from \r\n[L1714] 51 to\u00a000.\r\n[L1715] (c) Give numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , 49, 50 to the subjects in alphabetical order by last name. Then use \r\n[L1716] your calculator\u2019s randInt command or a computer\u2019s random number generator to produce numbers \r\n[L1717] between 1 and 50.

It is randomized because the sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments by chance. The diagram in Figure 4.4 presents \r\n[L1725] the details: random assignment, the sizes of the groups and which treatment they \r\n[L1726] receive, and the response variable. There are, as we will see later, statistical rea\ufffesons for using treatment groups that are about equal in size. This type of design is \r\n[L1727] called a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1728] 50 volunteer\r\n[L1729] students\r\n[L1730] Random\r\n[L1731] assignment\r\n[L1732] Group 1\r\n[L1733] 25 students\r\n[L1734] Group 2\r\n[L1735] 25 students\r\n[L1736] Compare\r\n[L1737] SAT scores\r\n[L1738] Treatment 2\r\n[L1739] Classroom\r\n[L1740] Treatment 1\r\n[L1741] Online\r\n[L1742] FIGURE 4.4 Outline of a completely randomized design to compare online and classroom \r\n[L1743] instruction.\r\n[L1744] DEFINITION: Completely randomized design\r\n[L1745] In a completely randomized design, the treatments are assigned to all the experimen\ufffetal units completely by chance.\r\n[L1746] Notice that the definition of a completely randomized design does not require \r\n[L1747] that each treatment be assigned to an equal number of experimental units. It does \r\n[L1748] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L1749] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L1750] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L1751] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L1752] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L1753] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L1754] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1755] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L1756] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L1757] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L1758] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L1759] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L1760] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L1761] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L1762] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L1763] than it really is.\r\n[L1764] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments.

An electric company considers placing small \r\n[L1776] digital displays in households to show current electricity use and what the cost \r\n[L1777] would be if this use continued for a month. Will the displays reduce electricity \r\n[L1778] use? One cheaper approach is to give customers a chart and information about \r\n[L1779] monitoring their electricity use from their outside meter. Would this method \r\n[L1780] work almost as well? The company decides to conduct an experiment to com\ufffepare these two approaches (display, chart) with a control group of customers \r\n[L1781] who receive information about energy consumption but no help in monitoring \r\n[L1782] electricity use.\r\n[L1783] PROBLEM: Outline a completely randomized design involving 60 single-family residences in the \r\n[L1784] same city who are willing to participate in such an experiment.

You might be thinking that the change \r\n[L1843] in electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\n[L1844] would tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\n[L1845] Suppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\n[L1846] households might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\n[L1847] whether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\n[L1848] confounding?!)\r\n[L1849] Many experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\n[L1850] group that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\n[L1851] an active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\n[L1852] developed drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\n[L1853] work. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\n[L1854] control group.\r\n[L1855] Some experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group. That\u2019s appropriate \r\n[L1856] if researchers simply want to compare the effects of several treatments, and not \r\n[L1857] to determine whether any of them works better than an inactive treatment. For \r\n[L1858] instance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\n[L1859] of paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\n[L1860] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L1861] Music students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately.

Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L1863] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L1864] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L1865] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L1866] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L1867] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment.

Provide enough detail that \r\n[L1870] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L1871] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L1872] Three Principles of \r\n[L1873] Experimental Design\r\n[L1874] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L1875] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L1876] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L1877] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L1878] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1879] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L1880] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L1881] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L1882] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1883] ?\r\n[L1884] THINK\r\n[L1885] ABOUT\r\n[L1886] IT","[L1887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","[L1888] Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L1889] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1890] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L1891] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L1892] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L1893] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L1894] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L1895] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L1896] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L1897] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L1898] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L1899] between the groups.\r\n[L1900] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L1901] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L1902] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L1903] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L1904] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L1905] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L1906] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L1907] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L1908] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L1909] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L1910] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L1911] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L1912] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L1913] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L1914] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L1915] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L1916] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L1917] experiment.\r\n[L1918] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L1919] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L1920] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks?

Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\n[L1922] help prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\n[L1923] male physicians.

There were several response \r\n[L1934] variables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\n[L1935] other medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\n[L1936] only 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\n[L1937] large enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\n[L1938] attacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\n[L1939] preventing cancer.\r\n[L1940] PROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\n[L1941] design was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\n[L1942] SOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\n[L1943] lurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\n[L1944] treatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\n[L1945] schedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\n[L1946] which subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\n[L1947] helped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\n[L1948] begin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\n[L1949] replication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\n[L1950] the groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\n[L1951] the random assignment.\r\n[L1952] The control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n[L1953] (placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\n[L1954] Experiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L1955] The logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\n[L1956] all the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\n[L1957] that all subjects really are treated identically.\r\n[L1958] If some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\n[L1959] group takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\n[L1960] the subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\n[L1961] experiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\n[L1962] On even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo. Many patients respond favorably to any treatment, even a placebo, perhaps \r\n[L1963] because they trust the doctor. The response to a dummy treatment is called the \r\n[L1964] Placebo\r\n[L1965] Factor 1:\r\n[L1966] Aspirin\r\n[L1967] Factor 2: Beta-carotene\r\n[L1968] Yes\r\n[L1969] Yes No\r\n[L1970] Aspirin Beta-carotene Aspirin Placebo\r\n[L1971] No\r\n[L1972] Placebo Beta-carotene Placebo Placebo\r\n[L1973] FIGURE 4.6 The treatments in the \r\n[L1974] Physicians\u2019 Health Study.","[L1975] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b06f1b5c1816f6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_37.jpg","size_bytes":61000,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1976] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>","[L1977] Section 4.2 Experiments 243\r\n[L1978] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1979] placebo effect. If some subjects did not take any pills, the effect of aspirin or \r\n[L1980] beta-carotene would be confounded with the placebo effect, the effect of simply \r\n[L1981] taking pills.\r\n[L1982] Curing Baldness and Soothing Pain\r\n[L1983] Do placebos work?\r\n[L1984] Want to help balding men keep their hair? Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\n[L1985] that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\n[L1986] heads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n[L1987] 24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\n[L1988] active medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\n[L1989] the pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\n[L1990] significantly less pain.24\r\n[L1991] When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\n[L1992] that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\n[L1993] placebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\n[L1994] treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\n[L1995] enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\n[L1996] place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\n[L1997] The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\n[L1998] their hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\n[L1999] beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\n[L2000] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L2001] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L2002] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L2003] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L2004] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L2005] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L2006] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L2007] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L2008] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L2009] Placebo effect","[L2010] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2011] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>","[L2012] 244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2013] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L2014] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L2015] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L2016] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L2017] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L2018] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L2019] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L2020] the response variable do know.\r\n[L2021] Single-blind\r\n[L2022] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L2023] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L2024] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L2025] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L2026] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L2027] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L2028] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L2029] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\n[L2030] received the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n[L2031] 1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n[L2032] 2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n[L2033] 3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L2034] experiment.\r\n[L2035] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L2036] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L2037] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L2038] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L2039] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L2040] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L2041] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L2042] significant.\r\n[L2043] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L2044] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L2045] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L2046] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L2047] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation. A statistically sig\ufffenificant association in data from a well-designed experiment does imply causation.","[L2048] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b86211c359fd2c0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_39.jpg","size_bytes":53857,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2049] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 41 / 75>","[L2050] Section 4.2 Experiments 245\r\n[L2051] ACTIVITY Distracted driving\r\n[L2052] MATERIALS: Deck of cards for each team of 3 to 4 students\r\n[L2053] Is talking on a cell phone while driving more distracting than talking to \r\n[L2054] a passenger? David Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah \r\n[L2055] designed an experiment to help answer this question. They used 48 un\ufffedergraduate students as subjects. The researchers randomly assigned half \r\n[L2056] of the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\n[L2057] the other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger. One \r\n[L2058] response variable was whether the driver stopped at a rest area that was \r\n[L2059] specified by researchers before the simulation started.

We need 48 cards from the deck to represent the drivers in this study. In the \r\n[L2069] original experiment, 33 drivers stopped at the rest area and 15 didn\u2019t. Since \r\n[L2070] we\u2019re assuming that the treatment received won\u2019t change whether each driver \r\n[L2071] stops at the rest area, we use 33 cards to represent drivers who stop and 15 cards \r\n[L2072] to represent those who don\u2019t.

Let\u2019s return \r\n[L2104] to the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\n[L2105] one group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L2106] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L2107] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L2108] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L2109] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L2110] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L2111] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L2112] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L2113] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L2114] response to the treatments.\r\n[L2115] Blocking\r\n[L2116] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L2117] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L2118] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L2119] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L2120] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

They decide to \r\n[L2130] perform an experiment using numerous pieces of dirty laundry \r\n[L2131] as the experimental units. The response variable is a cleanli\ufffeness rating on a scale of 0 (very dirty) to 10 (very clean). How \r\n[L2132] should researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water? They could \r\n[L2133] use a completely randomized design and hope that the \r\n[L2134] random assignment distributes the light-colored clothing \r\n[L2135] about evenly between the cold- and warm-water treatment \r\n[L2136] groups.

For example, if an ad appealed \r\n[L2221] 300\r\n[L2222] volunteer\r\n[L2223] subjects\r\n[L2224] Women\r\n[L2225] n  120\r\n[L2226] Random\r\n[L2227] assignment\r\n[L2228] Group 1\r\n[L2229] n  40\r\n[L2230] Group 3\r\n[L2231] n  40\r\n[L2232] Compare\r\n[L2233] reaction\r\n[L2234] Group 2\r\n[L2235] n  40\r\n[L2236] Ad 1\r\n[L2237] Ad 2\r\n[L2238] Ad 3\r\n[L2239] Men\r\n[L2240] n  180\r\n[L2241] Random\r\n[L2242] assignment\r\n[L2243] Group 1\r\n[L2244] n  60\r\n[L2245] Group 3\r\n[L2246] n  60\r\n[L2247] Compare\r\n[L2248] reaction\r\n[L2249] Group 2\r\n[L2250] n  60\r\n[L2251] Ad 1\r\n[L2252] Ad 2\r\n[L2253] Ad 3\r\n[L2254] FIGURE 4.8 Randomized block design for comparing responses to three advertisements.

The idea is to create blocks by matching pairs of similar \r\n[L2262] experimental units. Then we can use chance to decide which member of a pair \r\n[L2263] gets the first treatment. The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L2264] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L2265] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L2266] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L2267] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L2268] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L2269] Matched pairs design\r\n[L2270] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L2271] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L2272] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L2273] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L2274] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L2275] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L2276] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L2277] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L2278] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L2279] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L2280] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L2281] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L2282] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L2283] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L2284] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L2285] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates? In this Activity, \r\n[L2286] you will perform two experiments to try to answer this question.\r\n[L2287] 1. Completely randomized design For the first experiment, you\u2019ll randomly \r\n[L2288] assign half of the students in your class to stand and the other half to sit. You can \r\n[L2289] use the hat method, Table D, or technology to carry out the random assignment. \r\n[L2290] Once the two treatment groups have been formed, students should stand or sit \r\n[L2291] as required. Then they should measure their pulses for one minute. Have the \r\n[L2292] subjects in each group record their data on the board.\r\n[L2293] 2. Matched pairs design In a matched pairs design, each student should receive \r\n[L2294] both treatments in a random order. Since you already sat or stood in Step 1, \r\n[L2295] you just need to do the opposite now. As before, everyone should measure their \r\n[L2296] pulses for one minute after completing the treatment (that is, once they are \r\n[L2297] standing or sitting). Have all the subjects record their data (both measurements) \r\n[L2298] in a chart on the board.","[L2299] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 45 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d19bf42557d3861#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_44.jpg","size_bytes":57481,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2300] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>","[L2301] 250 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2302] 3. Analyze the data for the completely randomized design. Make a dotplot and \r\n[L2303] calculate the mean pulse rate for each group. Is there evidence that standing \r\n[L2304] pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2305] 4. Analyze the data for the matched pairs design. Since the data are paired \r\n[L2306] by student, your first step should be to calculate the difference in pulse rate \r\n[L2307] (standing \u2013 sitting) for each subject. Make a dotplot of these differences and cal\ufffeculate their mean. Is there evidence that standing pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2308] 5. What advantage does the matched pairs design have over the completely \r\n[L2309] randomized design?\r\n[L2310] An AP Statistics class with 24 students performed the \u201cGet Your Heart Beating\u201d \r\n[L2311] Activity. We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\n[L2312] EXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\n[L2313] Design determines analysis\r\n[L2314] A Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\n[L2315] randomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\n[L2316] standing group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n[L2317] 68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\n[L2318] higher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\n[L2319] pulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\n[L2320] graph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\n[L2321] standing pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\n[L2322] What about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\n[L2323] Fathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\n[L2324] rates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\n[L2325] difference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n[L2326] 24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\n[L2327] standing pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\n[L2328] evidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\n[L2329] Let\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\n[L2330] that we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\n[L2331] experimental designs. Blocking by subject in the matched pairs design greatly \r\n[L2332] reduced the variability in the response variable. That made it easier to detect \r\n[L2333] the fact that standing causes an increase in pulse rate. With the large amount \r\n[L2334] of variability in the completely randomized design, we were unable to draw \r\n[L2335] such a conclusion.","[L2336] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5c9678406de9a79#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_45.jpg","size_bytes":52515,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2337] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 47 / 75>","[L2338] Section 4.2 Experiments 251\r\n[L2339] Another important lesson to take away from the example is this: the design of the \r\n[L2340] study determines the appropriate method of analysis. For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\n[L2341] dotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\n[L2342] compare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\n[L2343] The following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\n[L2344] analyzing data from an experiment.\r\n[L2345] DATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\n[L2346] Most automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n[L2347] 78% nitrogen. Aircraft tires are filled with pure nitrogen, which is safer than air \r\n[L2348] in case of fire. Could filling automobile tires with nitrogen improve safety, perfor\ufffemance, or both?\r\n[L2349] Consumers Union designed a study to test whether nitrogen-filled tires would \r\n[L2350] maintain pressure better than air-filled tires. They obtained two tires from each of \r\n[L2351] several brands and then filled one tire in each pair with air and one with nitrogen. \r\n[L2352] All tires were inflated to a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch and then placed \r\n[L2353] outside for a year. At the end of the year, Consumers Union measured the pres\ufffesure in each tire. The amount of pressure lost (in pounds per square inch) during \r\n[L2354] the year for the air-filled and nitrogen-filled tires of each brand is shown in the \r\n[L2355] table below.29\r\n[L2356] Brand Air Nitrogen Brand Air Nitrogen\r\n[L2357] BF Goodrich Traction T/A HR 7.6 7.2 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 4.4 4.2\r\n[L2358] Bridgestone HP50 (Sears) 3.8 2.5 Sumitomo HTR H4 1.4 2.1\r\n[L2359] Bridgestone Potenza G009 3.7 1.6 Yokohama Avid H4S 4.3 3.0\r\n[L2360] Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.7 1.5 BF Goodrich Traction T/A V 5.5 3.4\r\n[L2361] Bridgestone Potenza EL400 2.1 1.0 Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.1 2.8\r\n[L2362] Continental Premier Contact H 4.9 3.1 Continental ContiExtreme Contact 5.0 3.4\r\n[L2363] Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 5.2 3.5 Continental ContiProContact 4.8 3.3\r\n[L2364] Dayton Daytona HR 3.4 3.2 Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 3.2 2.5\r\n[L2365] Falken Ziex ZE-512 4.1 3.3 General Exclaim UHP 6.8 2.7\r\n[L2366] Fuzion Hrl 2.7 2.2 Hankook Ventus V4 H105 3.1 1.4\r\n[L2367] General Exclaim 3.1 3.4 Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.5 1.5\r\n[L2368] Goodyear Assurance Tripletred 3.8 3.2 Michelin Pilot Exalto A/S 6.6 2.2\r\n[L2369] Hankook Optimo H418 3.0 0.9 Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 2.2 2.0\r\n[L2370] Kumho Solus KH16 6.2 3.4 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 2.5 2.7\r\n[L2371] Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.0 1.8 Sumitomo HTR+ 4.4 3.7\r\n[L2372] Michelin Pilot XGT H4 1.1 0.7\r\n[L2373] Does filling tires with nitrogen instead of compressed air reduce pressure loss? \r\n[L2374] Give appropriate graphical and numerical evidence to support your answer.","[L2375] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>","[L2376] 252 CHAPTER CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2377] s We can produce data intended to answer specific questions by observational\r\n[L2378] studies or experiments. An observational study gathers data on individuals \r\n[L2379] as they are. Experiments actively do something to people, animals, or \r\n[L2380] objects in order to measure their response.\r\n[L2381] s Statistical studies often try to show that changing one variable (the \r\n[L2382] explanatory variable) causes changes in another variable (the response\r\n[L2383] variable). Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\n[L2384] be distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\n[L2385] experiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\n[L2386] actually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\n[L2387] variable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\n[L2388] s In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\n[L2389] is a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\n[L2390] s The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\n[L2391] manner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\n[L2392] principles of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\n[L2393] assignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\n[L2394] s The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\n[L2395] two or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\n[L2396] with other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\n[L2397] s Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\n[L2398] Random assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\n[L2399] chance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\n[L2400] comparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\n[L2401] s Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\n[L2402] reduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\n[L2403] likely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\n[L2404] s Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\n[L2405] neither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\n[L2406] responses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\n[L2407] the other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\n[L2408] s Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\n[L2409] That helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\n[L2410] patients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\n[L2411] they have received an inactive treatment.\r\n[L2412] s In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\n[L2413] individuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\n[L2414] Randomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\n[L2415] helps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\n[L2416] s Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\n[L2417] treatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\n[L2418] treatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\n[L2419] closely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\n[L2420] Summary SECTION 4.2","[L2421] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","[L2423] Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n[L2424] 45.

In \r\n[L2525] some calls, the interviewer gave her name, in others \r\n[L2526] she identified the university she was representing, \r\n[L2527] and in still others she identified both herself and the \r\n[L2528] university. For each type of call, the interviewer either \r\n[L2529] did or did not offer to send a copy of the final survey \r\n[L2530] results to the person interviewed. Do these differences \r\n[L2531] in the introduction affect whether the interview is \r\n[L2532] completed?\r\n[L2533] 54. Eat well and exercise Most American adolescents \r\n[L2534] don\u2019t eat well and don\u2019t exercise enough. Can middle \r\n[L2535] schools increase physical activity among \r\n[L2536] their students? Can they persuade students to eat \r\n[L2537] better? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\n[L2538] intervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\n[L2539] school day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\n[L2540] for healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\n[L2541] school was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention. The \r\n[L2542] investigators observed physical activity and lunchtime \r\n[L2543] consumption of fat.\r\n[L2544] 55. Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\n[L2545] will use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\n[L2546] raise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\n[L2547] either 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n[L2548] 150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\n[L2549] combinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\n[L2550] fabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\n[L2551] for quality.\r\n[L2552] 56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\n[L2553] the increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\n[L2554] they stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\n[L2555] beat of a metronome. The step was either 5.75 or 11.5 \r\n[L2556] inches high and the metronome beat was 14, 21, or \r\n[L2557] 28 steps per minute. Five students stepped at each \r\n[L2558] combination of height and speed.\r\n[L2559] 57. Cocoa and blood flow A study conducted by Nor\ufffeman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham \r\n[L2560] and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, \r\n[L2561] involved 27 healthy people aged 18 to 72. Each \r\n[L2562] subject consumed a cocoa beverage containing 900 \r\n[L2563] milligrams of flavonols (a class of flavonoids) daily \r\n[L2564] for five days. Using a finger cuff, blood flow was mea\ufffesured on the first and fifth days of the study. After five \r\n[L2565] days, researchers measured what they called \u201csignifi\ufffecant improvement\u201d in blood flow and the function of \r\n[L2566] the cells that line the blood vessels.33 What flaw in the \r\n[L2567] design of this experiment makes it impossible to say \r\n[L2568] whether the cocoa really caused the improved blood \r\n[L2569] flow? Explain.\r\n[L2570] 58. Reducing unemployment Will cash bonuses speed \r\n[L2571] the return to work of unemployed people? A state \r\n[L2572] department of labor notes that last year 68% of people \r\n[L2573] who filed claims for unemployment insurance found \r\n[L2574] a new job within 15 weeks. As an experiment, this year \r\n[L2575] the state offers $500 to people filing unemployment \r\n[L2576] claims if they find a job within 15 weeks. The percent \r\n[L2577] who do so increases to 77%. What flaw in the design \r\n[L2578] of this experiment makes it impossible to say whether \r\n[L2579] the bonus really caused the increase? Explain.\r\n[L2580] 59. Layoffs and \u201csurvivor guilt\u201d Workers who survive a \r\n[L2581] layoff of other employees at their location may suffer \r\n[L2582] from \u201csurvivor guilt.\u201d A study of survivor guilt and \r\n[L2583] its effects used as subjects 120 students who were \r\n[L2584] offered an opportunity to earn extra course credit by \r\n[L2585] doing proofreading. Each subject worked in the same \r\n[L2586] cubicle as another student, who was an accomplice \r\n[L2587] of the experimenters. At a break midway through the \r\n[L2588] work, one of three things happened:\r\n[L2589] Treatment 1: The accomplice was told to leave; it was \r\n[L2590] explained that this was because she performed poorly.\r\n[L2591] Treatment 2: It was explained that unforeseen circum\ufffestances meant there was only enough work for one \r\n[L2592] person. By \u201cchance,\u201d the accomplice was chosen to \r\n[L2593] be laid off.\r\n[L2594] Treatment 3: Both students continued to work after \r\n[L2595] the break.\r\n[L2596] The subjects\u2019 work performance after the break \r\n[L2597] was compared with performance before the break.34\r\n[L2598] Describe how you would randomly assign the \r\n[L2599] subjects to the treatments\r\n[L2600] (a) using slips of paper.\r\n[L2601] (b) using Table D.\r\n[L2602] (c) using technology.\r\n[L2603] 60.

Headache relief Doctors identify \u201cchronic tension\ufffetype headaches\u201d as headaches that occur almost \r\n[L2615] daily for at least six months. Can antidepressant \r\n[L2616] medications or stress management training reduce \r\n[L2617] the number and severity of these headaches? Are both \r\n[L2618] together more effective than either alone? Investiga\ufffetors compared four treatments: antidepressant alone, \r\n[L2619] placebo alone, antidepressant plus stress manage\ufffement, and placebo plus stress management. The \r\n[L2620] headache sufferers named in the following table have \r\n[L2621] agreed to participate in the study.\r\n[L2622] Acosta Duncan Han Liang Padilla Valasco\r\n[L2623] Asihiro Durr Howard Maldonado Plochman Vaughn\r\n[L2624] Bennett Edwards Hruska Marsden Rosen Wei\r\n[L2625] Bikalis Farouk Imrani Montoya Solomon Wilder\r\n[L2626] Chen Fleming James O\u2019Brian Trujillo Willis\r\n[L2627] Clemente George Kaplan Ogle Tullock Zhang\r\n[L2628] (a) Outline the design of the experiment.

The changing climate will \r\n[L2634] probably bring more rain to California, but we don\u2019t \r\n[L2635] know whether the additional rain will come during the \r\n[L2636] winter wet season or extend into the long dry season in \r\n[L2637] spring and summer. Kenwyn Suttle of the University \r\n[L2638] of California at Berkeley and his coworkers carried \r\n[L2639] out an experiment to study the effects of more rain in \r\n[L2640] either season. They randomly assigned plots of open \r\n[L2641] grassland to 3 treatments: added water equal to 20% of \r\n[L2642] annual rainfall either during January to March (winter) \r\n[L2643] or during April to June (spring), and no added water \r\n[L2644] (control). Thirty-six circular plots of area 70 square me\ufffeters were available (see the photo), of which 18 were \r\n[L2645] used for this study. One response variable was total \r\n[L2646] plant biomass, in grams per square meter, produced in \r\n[L2647] a plot over a year.35\r\n[L2648] (a) Outline the design of the experiment.

Treating prostate disease A large study used records \r\n[L2654] from Canada\u2019s national health care system to com\ufffepare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate \r\n[L2655] disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery \r\n[L2656] and a new method that does not require surgery. The \r\n[L2657] records described many patients whose doctors had \r\n[L2658] chosen each method. The study found that patients \r\n[L2659] treated by the new method were significantly more \r\n[L2660] likely to die within 8 years.36\r\n[L2661] (a) Further study of the data showed that this conclu\ufffesion was wrong. The extra deaths among patients who \r\n[L2662] got the new method could be explained by lurking vari\ufffeables. What lurking variables might be confounded with \r\n[L2663] a doctor\u2019s choice of surgical or nonsurgical treatment?\r\n[L2664] (b) You have 300 prostate patients who are willing to \r\n[L2665] serve as subjects in an experiment to compare the two \r\n[L2666] methods.

Getting teachers to come to school Elementary \r\n[L2669] schools in rural India are usually small, with a single \r\n[L2670] teacher. The teachers often fail to show up for work. \r\n[L2671] Here is an idea for improving attendance: give the \r\n[L2672] teacher a digital camera with a tamperproof time \r\n[L2673] and date stamp and ask a student to take a photo of \r\n[L2674] the teacher and class at the beginning and end of the \r\n[L2675] day. Offer the teacher better pay for good attendance, \r\n[L2676] verified by the photos. Will this work? Researchers \r\n[L2677] obtained permission to use 120 rural schools in \r\n[L2678] Rajasthan for an experiment to find out.37\r\n[L2679] (a) Explain why it would not be a good idea to offer \r\n[L2680] better pay for good attendance to the teachers in all \r\n[L2681] 120 schools and then to compare this year\u2019s atten\ufffedance with last year\u2019s.\r\n[L2682] (b) Write a few sentences describing how you would \r\n[L2683] design this experiment.\r\n[L2684] 65. Stronger players A football coach hears that a new \r\n[L2685] exercise program will increase upper-body strength \r\n[L2686] better than lifting weights.

The effects of day care Does day care help low\ufffeincome children stay in school and hold good jobs \r\n[L2712] later in life? The Carolina Abecedarian Project (the \r\n[L2713] name suggests the ABCs) has followed a group of \r\n[L2714] 111 children since 1972. Back then, these individu\ufffeals were all healthy but low-income black infants in \r\n[L2715] Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All the infants received \r\n[L2716] nutritional supplements and help from social workers. \r\n[L2717] Half were also assigned at random to an intensive \r\n[L2718] preschool program.38\r\n[L2719] (a) Explain the purpose of each of the three experi\ufffemental design principles.\r\n[L2720] (b) Describe how each of these principles was used \r\n[L2721] in this study.\r\n[L2722] 68. Killing weeds A biologist would like to determine \r\n[L2723] which of two brands of weed killer is less likely to \r\n[L2724] harm the plants in a garden at the university. Before \r\n[L2725] spraying near the plants, the biologist decides to \r\n[L2726] conduct an experiment using 24 individual plants. \r\n[L2727] Which of the following two plans for randomly \r\n[L2728] assigning the treatments should the biologist use? \r\n[L2729] Why?\r\n[L2730] Plan A: Choose the 12 healthiest-looking plants. \r\n[L2731] Apply Brand X weed killer to all 12 of those plants. \r\n[L2732] Apply Brand Y weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2733] Plan B: Choose 12 of the 24 plants at random. Apply \r\n[L2734] Brand X weed killer to those 12 plants and Brand Y \r\n[L2735] weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2736] 69. Do placebos really work? Researchers in Japan \r\n[L2737] conducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\n[L2738] were extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\n[L2739] each subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\n[L2740] told the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\n[L2741] subject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\n[L2742] was poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\n[L2743] the arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n[L2744] 13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\n[L2745] poison ivy leaf.39\r\n[L2746] (a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n[L2747] (b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\n[L2748] idea of a placebo effect.\r\n[L2749] 70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\n[L2750] chronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\n[L2751] and needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\n[L2752] will be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\n[L2753] percent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n[L2754] (a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\n[L2755] drug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n[L2756] (b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\n[L2757] getting the new drug or a placebo? How would this \r\n[L2758] knowledge probably affect their reactions?\r\n[L2759] 71. Meditation for anxiety An experiment that claimed \r\n[L2760] to show that meditation lowers anxiety proceeded as \r\n[L2761] follows. The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\n[L2762] and rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\n[L2763] were randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\n[L2764] meditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\n[L2765] simply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\n[L2766] the experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\n[L2767] and rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\n[L2768] now had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\n[L2769] Explain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\n[L2770] could bias the reported results.\r\n[L2771] 72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\n[L2772] testosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\n[L2773] cause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\n[L2774] fat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\n[L2775] supplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\n[L2776] in the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\n[L2777] with low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\n[L2778] a testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\n[L2779] in the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\n[L2780] described the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\n[L2781] placebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\n[L2782] terms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n[L2783] 73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\n[L2784] determine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\n[L2785] acupuncture could help infertile women become \r\n[L2786] pregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\n[L2787] undergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\n[L2788] were recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\n[L2789] randomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n[L2790] 25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\n[L2791] minutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\n[L2792] were instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\n[L2793] embryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n[L2794] 34 women became pregnant. In the control group, \r\n[L2795] 21 women became pregnant.\r\n[L2796] (a) Describe how the three principles of experimen\ufffetal design were addressed in this study.\r\n[L2797] (b) The difference in the percent of women who \r\n[L2798] became pregnant in the two groups is statistically \r\n[L2799] significant. Explain what this means to someone who \r\n[L2800] knows little statistics.\r\n[L2801] (c) Explain why the placebo effect prevents us from \r\n[L2802] concluding that acupuncture caused the difference in \r\n[L2803] pregnancy rates.\r\n[L2804] pg 241","[L2805] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>","[L2806] Section 4.2 Experiments 257\r\n[L2807] 74. Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\n[L2808] colleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\n[L2809] Half of the participants were randomly assigned \r\n[L2810] to a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\n[L2811] assigned to a low-fat diet.

According to the popular \r\n[L2827] TV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\n[L2828] March 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\n[L2829] presented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\n[L2830] subjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\n[L2831] an extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\n[L2832] camera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\n[L2833] seed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\n[L2834] yawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\n[L2835] who had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\n[L2836] given a yawn seed, 10 yawned. Adam Savage and Ja\ufffemie Hyneman, the cohosts of Mythbusters, used these \r\n[L2837] results to conclude that yawning is contagious.\r\n[L2838] (a) Explain how you could use slips of paper to ran\ufffedomly reassign the subjects to the treatment groups.\r\n[L2839] (b) Suppose we used your method in (a) to redo the \r\n[L2840] random assignment 50 times.

Doctors and nurses Nurse-practitioners are nurses \r\n[L2864] with advanced qualifications who often act much like \r\n[L2865] primary-care physicians. Are they as effective as \r\n[L2866] doctors at treating patients with chronic conditions? \r\n[L2867] An experiment was conducted with 1316 patients \r\n[L2868] who had been diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, or \r\n[L2869] high blood pressure. Within each condition, patients \r\n[L2870] were randomly assigned to either a doctor or a \r\n[L2871] nurse-practitioner. The response variables included \r\n[L2872] measures of the patients\u2019 health and of their \r\n[L2873] satisfaction with their medical care after 6 months.43\r\n[L2874] (a) Which are the blocks in this experiment: the \r\n[L2875] different diagnoses (asthma, etc.) or the type of care \r\n[L2876] (nurse or doctor)? Why?\r\n[L2877] (b) Explain why a randomized block design is \r\n[L2878] preferable to a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2879] setting.\r\n[L2880] 78. Comparing cancer treatments The progress of a \r\n[L2881] type of cancer differs in women and men. Researchers \r\n[L2882] want to design an experiment to compare three thera\ufffepies for this cancer.

In the cornfield An agriculture researcher wants to \r\n[L2895] compare the yield of 5 corn varieties: A, B, C, D, and \r\n[L2896] E. The field in which the experiment will be carried \r\n[L2897] out increases in fertility from north to south. The \r\n[L2898] researcher therefore divides the field into 25 plots \r\n[L2899] of equal size, arranged in 5 east\u2013west rows of 5 plots \r\n[L2900] each, as shown in the diagram.\r\n[L2901] North\r\n[L2902] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2903] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2904] setting.\r\n[L2905] (b) Should the researcher use the rows or the \r\n[L2906] columns of the field as blocks?

Comparing weight-loss treatments Twenty over\ufffeweight females have agreed to participate in a study \r\n[L2911] of the effectiveness of four weight-loss treatments: \r\n[L2912] A, B, C, and D. The researcher first calculates how \r\n[L2913] overweight each subject is by comparing the subject\u2019s \r\n[L2914] actual weight with her \u201cideal\u201d weight. The subjects \r\n[L2915] and their excess weights in pounds are as follows:\r\n[L2916] Birnbaum 35 Hernandez 25 Moses 25 Smith 29\r\n[L2917] Brown 34 Jackson 33 Nevesky 39 Stall 33\r\n[L2918] Brunk 30 Kendall 28 Obrach 30 Tran 35\r\n[L2919] Cruz 34 Loren 32 Rodriguez 30 Wilansky 42\r\n[L2920] Deng 24 Mann 28 Santiago 27 Williams 22\r\n[L2921] The response variable is the weight lost after 8 weeks of \r\n[L2922] treatment.

A nutrition experimenter intends to \r\n[L2934] compare the weight gain of newly weaned male \r\n[L2935] rats fed Diet A with that of rats fed Diet B. To do this, \r\n[L2936] she will feed each diet to 10 rats. She has available \r\n[L2937] 10 rats from one litter and 10 rats from a second \r\n[L2938] litter. Rats in the first litter appear to be slightly \r\n[L2939] healthier.\r\n[L2940] (a) If the 10 rats from Litter 1 were fed Diet A, the \r\n[L2941] effects of genetics and diet would be confounded, and \r\n[L2942] the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A. \r\n[L2943] Explain this statement carefully.\r\n[L2944] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2945] 82. Technology for teaching statistics The Brigham \r\n[L2946] Young University (BYU) statistics department is \r\n[L2947] performing experiments to compare teaching meth\ufffeods. Response variables include students\u2019 final-exam \r\n[L2948] scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. \r\n[L2949] One study compares two levels of technology for large \r\n[L2950] lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) \r\n[L2951] and multimedia. There are 8 lecture sections of a \r\n[L2952] basic statistics course at BYU, each with about 200 \r\n[L2953] students. There are four instructors, each of whom \r\n[L2954] teaches two sections.44 Suppose the sections and \r\n[L2955] lecturers are as follows:\r\n[L2956] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2957] 1 Hilton\r\n[L2958] 2 Christensen\r\n[L2959] 3 Hadfield\r\n[L2960] 4 Hadfield\r\n[L2961] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2962] 5 Tolley\r\n[L2963] 6 Hilton\r\n[L2964] 7 Tolley\r\n[L2965] 8 Christensen\r\n[L2966] (a) Suppose we randomly assign two lecturers to use \r\n[L2967] standard technology in their sections and the other \r\n[L2968] two lecturers to use multimedia technology.

Chocolate gets my heart pumping Cardiologists \r\n[L3000] at Athens Medical School in Greece wanted to test \r\n[L3001] whether chocolate affected blood flow in the blood \r\n[L3002] vessels. The researchers recruited 17 healthy young \r\n[L3003] volunteers, who were each given a 3.5-ounce bar of \r\n[L3004] dark chocolate, either bittersweet or fake chocolate. \r\n[L3005] On another day, the volunteers were switched. The \r\n[L3006] subjects had no chocolate outside the study, and \r\n[L3007] investigators didn\u2019t know whether a subject had eaten \r\n[L3008] the real or the fake chocolate. An ultrasound was \r\n[L3009] taken of each volunteer\u2019s upper arm to see the func\ufffetioning of the cells in the walls of the main artery. \r\n[L3010] The investigators found that blood vessel function was \r\n[L3011] improved when the subjects ate bittersweet chocolate, \r\n[L3012] and that there were no such changes when they ate \r\n[L3013] the placebo (fake chocolate).45\r\n[L3014] (a) What type of design did the investigators use in \r\n[L3015] their study?\r\n[L3016] (b) Explain why the investigators chose this design \r\n[L3017] instead of a completely randomized design.\r\n[L3018] (c) Why is it important to randomly assign the order \r\n[L3019] of the treatments for the subjects?\r\n[L3020] 85. Room temperature and dexterity An expert on \r\n[L3021] worker performance is interested in the effect of \r\n[L3022] room temperature on the performance of tasks \r\n[L3023] requiring manual dexterity. She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\n[L3024] variable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\n[L3025] a 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\n[L3026] requires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\n[L3027] subject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\n[L3028] make as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\n[L3029] continuous effort.\r\n[L3030] (a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\n[L3031] compare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\n[L3032] available.\r\n[L3033] (b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\n[L3034] wide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\n[L3035] subjects in each group. Describe in detail the design \r\n[L3036] of a matched pairs experiment in which each subject \r\n[L3037] serves as his or her own control.\r\n[L3038] 86. Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\n[L3039] of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\n[L3040] increasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\n[L3041] Because plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\n[L3042] CO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\n[L3043] An elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\n[L3044] CO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\n[L3045] the growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\n[L3046] untreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\n[L3047] growth. We can afford to treat three circular areas.46\r\n[L3048] (a) Describe the design of a completely randomized \r\n[L3049] experiment using 6 well-separated 30-meter circular \r\n[L3050] areas in a pine forest.

Separate by \r\n[L3061] gender, since male and female bodies might respond \r\n[L3062] differently to deodorant. Give all the males Brand A \r\n[L3063] deodorant and all the females Brand B. Have each \r\n[L3064] student rate how well the deodorant is still working \r\n[L3065] at the end of the school day on a 0 to 10 scale. Then \r\n[L3066] compare ratings for the two treatments.\r\n[L3067] (a) Identify any flaws you see in the proposed design \r\n[L3068] for this experiment.\r\n[L3069] (b) Describe how you would design the experiment. \r\n[L3070] Explain how your design addresses each of the \r\n[L3071] problems you identified in (a).\r\n[L3072] 88.

Can changing diet reduce high blood pressure? \r\n[L3098] Vegetarian diets and low-salt diets are both promising. \r\n[L3099] Men with high blood pressure are assigned at random \r\n[L3100] to four diets: (1) normal diet with unrestricted salt; \r\n[L3101] (2) vegetarian with unrestricted salt; (3) normal with \r\n[L3102] restricted salt; and (4) vegetarian with restricted salt. \r\n[L3103] This experiment has\r\n[L3104] (a) one factor, the type of diet.\r\n[L3105] (b) two factors, high blood pressure and type of diet.\r\n[L3106] (c) two factors, normal/vegetarian diet and unre\ufffestricted/restricted salt.\r\n[L3107] (d) three factors, men, high blood pressure, and type \r\n[L3108] of diet.\r\n[L3109] (e) four factors, the four diets being compared.\r\n[L3110] 92.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L3219] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L3220] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L3221] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L3222] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L3223] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L3224] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3225] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L3226] on the design of the study.\r\n[L3227] Scope of Inference\r\n[L3228] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L3229] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L3230] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L3231] results of the sample.\r\n[L3232] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L3233] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L3234] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L3235] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L3236] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L3237] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L3238] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L3239] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L3240] 4.3\r\n[L3241] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","[L3242] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3243] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","[L3244] 262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3245] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L3246] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L3247] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L3248] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L3249] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L3250] Yes No\r\n[L3251] Were individuals \r\n[L3252] randomly selected?\r\n[L3253] Yes\r\n[L3254] Inference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\n[L3255] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3256] No Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\n[L3257] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3258] Well-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\n[L3259] However, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\n[L3260] larger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\n[L3261] effect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\n[L3262] rules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\n[L3263] random sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\n[L3264] example illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\n[L3265] EXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\n[L3266] Determining scope of inference\r\n[L3267] A small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\n[L3268] The dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\n[L3269] Design 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3270] to take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L3271] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L3272] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L3273] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L3274] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3275] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L3276] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3277] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3278] part in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3279] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3280] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L3281] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3282] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L3283] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L3284] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L3285] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L3286] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L3287] SOLUTION:\r\n[L3288] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L3289] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments ","[L3290] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a9a2c4c5c24a51b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_57.jpg","size_bytes":59616,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3291] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>","[L3292] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L3293] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3294] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L3295] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L3296] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L3297] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L3298] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L3299] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L3300] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L3301] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L3302] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L3303] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L3304] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L3305] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L3306] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L3307] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L3308] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L3309] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L3310] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L3311] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L3312] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L3313] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L3314] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L3315] the town.\r\n[L3316] The Challenges of \r\n[L3317] Establishing Causation\r\n[L3318] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L3319] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L3320] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L3321] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L3322] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L3323] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L3324] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\n[L3325] Lack of realism\r\n[L3326] Do those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3327] since 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\n[L3328] showed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\n[L3329] But requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\n[L3330] What happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\n[L3331] all cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\n[L3332] For Practice Try Exercise 105","[L3333] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3334] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","[L3335] 264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3336] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3337] In some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\n[L3338] these important questions:\r\n[L3339] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L3340] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L3341] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L3342] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L3343] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L3344] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L3345] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L3346] studies.\r\n[L3347] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L3348] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L3349] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L3350] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L3351] Living with observational studies\r\n[L3352] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L3353] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L3354] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L3355] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L3356] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L3357] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L3358] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L3359] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L3360] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L3361] experiment?\r\n[L3362] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L3363] very strong.\r\n[L3364] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L3365] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L3366] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L3367] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L3368] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L3369] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L3370] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L3371] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L3372] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L3373] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L3374] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L3375] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L3376] cancer death among women.","[L3377] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3378] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","[L3379] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L3380] sThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\n[L3381] cigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\n[L3382] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L3383] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3384] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L3385] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L3386] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L3387] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\n[L3388] observational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\n[L3389] Data Ethics*\r\n[L3390] Medical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\n[L3391] Shouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\n[L3392] reasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L3393] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L3394] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L3395] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L3396] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L3397] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L3398] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L3399] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L3400] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L3401] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L3402] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L3403] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\n[L3404] knows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\n[L3405] the physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\n[L3406] sWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L3407] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L3408] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L3409] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L3410] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L3411] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\n[L3412] are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\n[L3413] data from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\n[L3414] Basic Data Ethics\r\n[L3415] All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\n[L3416] board charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\n[L3417] All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\n[L3418] before data are collected.\r\n[L3419] All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\n[L3420] groups of subjects may be made public.\r\n[L3421] *This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","[L3422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","[L3423] 266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3424] The law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\n[L3425] obey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\n[L3426] Institutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\n[L3427] to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\n[L3428] it is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\n[L3429] board, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\n[L3430] recruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\n[L3431] study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\n[L3432] are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\n[L3433] research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\n[L3434] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L3435] boards.\r\n[L3436] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L3437] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L3438] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L3439] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L3440] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L3441] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L3442] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L3443] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L3444] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L3445] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L3446] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L3447] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L3448] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L3449] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L3450] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity.

Anonymity is rare in statistical stud\ufffeies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it \r\n[L3454] prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform individuals of results.\r\n[L3455] Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L3456] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L3457] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L3458] other identification have been removed from the data available for search.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L3496] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L3497] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L3498] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L3499] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L3500] results.\r\n[L3501] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L3502] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L3503] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L3504] lurking variables.\r\n[L3505] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L3506] review board. All participants must give their informed consent before \r\n[L3507] taking part. Any information about the individuals in the study must be \r\n[L3508] kept confidential.\r\n[L3509] s Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions \r\n[L3510] that can\u2019t be answered without them. Also remember that \u201cthe interests of \r\n[L3511] the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\u201d54\r\n[L3512] Summary SECTION 4.3\r\n[L3513] Magnets and Pain\r\n[L3514] Let\u2019s return to the chapter-opening Case Study (page 205). Researchers carried \r\n[L3515] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L3516] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\n[L3517] dotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\n[L3518] magnet).\r\n[L3519] The average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\n[L3520] and 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\n[L3521] significant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\n[L3522] The difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\n[L3523] too large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain. But since the subjects were volunteers, we can\u2019t \r\n[L3524] safely generalize the findings of this experiment to any larger \r\n[L3525] population.\r\n[L3526] case closed","[L3527] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 65 / 75>","[L3528] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 269\r\n[L3529] 102. Random sampling versus random assignment\r\n[L3530] Explain the difference between the types of \r\n[L3531] inference that can be made as a result of random \r\n[L3532] sampling and random assignment.\r\n[L3533] 103. Foster care versus orphanages Do abandoned \r\n[L3534] children placed in foster homes do better than \r\n[L3535] similar children placed in an institution? The \r\n[L3536] Bucharest Early Intervention Project found that \r\n[L3537] the answer is a clear \u201cYes.\u201d The subjects were 136 \r\n[L3538] young children abandoned at birth and living in \r\n[L3539] orphanages in Bucharest, Romania. Half of the \r\n[L3540] children, chosen at random, were placed in foster \r\n[L3541] homes. The other half remained in the orphanages.55\r\n[L3542] (Foster care was not easily available in Romania at \r\n[L3543] the time and so was paid for by the study.) What \r\n[L3544] conclusion can we draw from this study? Explain.\r\n[L3545] 104. Frozen batteries Will storing batteries in a freezer \r\n[L3546] make them last longer? To find out, a company that \r\n[L3547] produces batteries takes a random sample of 100 AA \r\n[L3548] batteries from its warehouse. The company \r\n[L3549] statistician randomly assigns 50 batteries to be stored \r\n[L3550] in the freezer and the other 50 to be stored at room \r\n[L3551] temperature for 3 years. At the end of that time \r\n[L3552] period, each battery\u2019s charge is tested. Result:\r\n[L3553] Batteries stored in the freezer had a higher average \r\n[L3554] charge, and the difference between the groups was \r\n[L3555] statistically significant. What conclusion can we \r\n[L3556] draw from this study? Explain.\r\n[L3557] 105. Who talks more\u2014women or men? According to \r\n[L3558] Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain,\r\n[L3559] women say nearly three times as many words per day \r\n[L3560] as men. Skeptical researchers devised a study to test \r\n[L3561] this claim. They used electronic devices to record \r\n[L3562] the talking patterns of 396 university students who \r\n[L3563] volunteered to participate in the study. The device \r\n[L3564] was programmed to record 30 seconds of sound \r\n[L3565] every 12.5 minutes without the carrier\u2019s knowledge. \r\n[L3566] According to a published report of the study in \r\n[L3567] Scientific American, \u201cMen showed a slightly wider \r\n[L3568] variability in words uttered.... But in the end, the \r\n[L3569] sexes came out just about even in the daily averages: \r\n[L3570] women at 16,215 words and men at 15,669.\u201d56 This \r\n[L3571] difference was not statistically significant. What \r\n[L3572] conclusion can we draw from this study? Explain.\r\n[L3573] 106. Attend church, live longer? One of the better \r\n[L3574] studies of the effect of regular attendance at religious \r\n[L3575] services gathered data from a random sample of \r\n[L3576] 3617 adults. The researchers then measured lots of \r\n[L3577] variables, not just the explanatory variable (religious \r\n[L3578] activities) and the response variable (length of life). \r\n[L3579] A news article said: \u201cChurchgoers were more likely \r\n[L3580] to be nonsmokers, physically active, and at their \r\n[L3581] right weight. But even after health behaviors were \r\n[L3582] taken into account, those not attending religious \r\n[L3583] services regularly still were about 25% more likely to \r\n[L3584] have died.\u201d57 What conclusion can we draw from \r\n[L3585] this study? Explain.\r\n[L3586] 107. Daytime running lights Canada requires that cars \r\n[L3587] be equipped with \u201cdaytime running lights,\u201d \r\n[L3588] headlights that automatically come on at a low \r\n[L3589] level when the car is started. Some manufacturers \r\n[L3590] are now equipping cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3591] with running lights. Will running lights reduce \r\n[L3592] accidents by making cars more visible? An \r\n[L3593] experiment conducted in a driving simulator \r\n[L3594] suggests that the answer may be \u201cYes.\u201d What \r\n[L3595] concerns would you have about generalizing the \r\n[L3596] results of such an experiment?\r\n[L3597] 108. Studying frustration A psychologist wants to study \r\n[L3598] the effects of failure and frustration on the \r\n[L3599] relationships among members of a work team. \r\n[L3600] She forms a team of students, brings them to the \r\n[L3601] psychology lab, and has them play a game that \r\n[L3602] requires teamwork. The game is rigged so that they \r\n[L3603] lose regularly. The psychologist observes the students \r\n[L3604] through a one-way window and notes the changes in \r\n[L3605] their behavior during an evening of game playing. \r\n[L3606] Can the psychologist generalize the results of her \r\n[L3607] study to a team of employees that spends months \r\n[L3608] developing a new product that never works right and \r\n[L3609] is finally abandoned by their company? Explain.\r\n[L3610] 109.* Minimal risk? You have been invited to serve on \r\n[L3611] a college\u2019s institutional review board. You must \r\n[L3612] decide whether several research proposals qualify for \r\n[L3613] lighter review because they involve only minimal \r\n[L3614] risk to subjects. Federal regulations say that \u201cminimal \r\n[L3615] risk\u201d means the risks are no greater than \u201cthose \r\n[L3616] ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the \r\n[L3617] performance of routine physical or psychological \r\n[L3618] examinations or tests.\u201d That\u2019s vague.

Government regulations require that \r\n[L3632] institutional review boards consist of at least five people, \r\n[L3633] including at least one scientist, one nonscientist, and \r\n[L3634] one person from outside the institution. Most boards \r\n[L3635] are larger, but many contain just one outsider.\r\n[L3636] (a) Why should review boards contain people who \r\n[L3637] are not scientists?\r\n[L3638] (b) Do you think that one outside member is \r\n[L3639] enough?

In which of the circumstances \r\n[L3642] below would you allow collecting personal \r\n[L3643] information without the subjects\u2019 consent?\r\n[L3644] (a) A government agency takes a random sample \r\n[L3645] of income tax returns to obtain information on the \r\n[L3646] average income of people in different occupations. \r\n[L3647] Only the incomes and occupations are recorded \r\n[L3648] from the returns, not the names.\r\n[L3649] (b) A social psychologist attends public meetings \r\n[L3650] of a religious group to study the behavior patterns\r\n[L3651] of members.\r\n[L3652] (c) A social psychologist pretends to be converted to \r\n[L3653] membership in a religious group and attends private \r\n[L3654] meetings to study the behavior patterns of members.\r\n[L3655] 112.* Surveys of youth A survey asked teenagers whether \r\n[L3656] they had ever consumed an alcoholic beverage. \r\n[L3657] Those who said \u201cYes\u201d were then asked, \u201cHow old \r\n[L3658] were you when you first consumed an alcoholic \r\n[L3659] beverage?\u201d Should consent of parents be required to \r\n[L3660] ask minors about alcohol, drugs, and other such \r\n[L3661] issues, or is consent of the minors themselves \r\n[L3662] enough? Give reasons for your opinion.\r\n[L3663] 113.*Anonymous? Confidential? One of the most impor\ufffetant nongovernment surveys in the United States is the \r\n[L3664] National Opinion Research Center\u2019s General Social \r\n[L3665] Survey. The GSS regularly monitors public opinion \r\n[L3666] on a wide variety of political and social issues. Inter\ufffeviews are conducted in person in the subject\u2019s home. \r\n[L3667] Are a subject\u2019s responses to GSS questions anonymous, \r\n[L3668] confidential, or both? Explain your answer.\r\n[L3669] 114.*Anonymous? Confidential? Texas A&M, like many \r\n[L3670] universities, offers screening for HIV, the virus that \r\n[L3671] causes AIDS.

Does this describe the \r\n[L3679] anonymous or the confidential screening? Why?\r\n[L3680] 115.* The Willowbrook hepatitis studies In the 1960s, \r\n[L3681] children entering the Willowbrook State School, an \r\n[L3682] institution for the mentally retarded, were \r\n[L3683] deliberately infected with hepatitis. The researchers \r\n[L3684] argued that almost all children in the institution \r\n[L3685] quickly became infected anyway. The studies \r\n[L3686] showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis \r\n[L3687] existed. This finding contributed to the development \r\n[L3688] of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, \r\n[L3689] the Willowbrook studies are now considered an \r\n[L3690] example of unethical research. Explain why, \r\n[L3691] according to current ethical standards, useful results \r\n[L3692] are not enough to allow a study.\r\n[L3693] 116.* Unequal benefits Researchers on aging proposed to \r\n[L3694] investigate the effect of supplemental health services \r\n[L3695] on the quality of life of older people. Eligible \r\n[L3696] patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to \r\n[L3697] be randomly assigned to treatment and control \r\n[L3698] groups. The treatment group would be offered \r\n[L3699] hearing aids, dentures, transportation, and other \r\n[L3700] services not available without charge to the control \r\n[L3701] group. The review board felt that providing these \r\n[L3702] services to some but not other persons in the same \r\n[L3703] institution raised ethical questions. Do you agree?\r\n[L3704] 117. Animal testing (1.1) \u201cIt is right to use animals for \r\n[L3705] medical testing if it might save human lives.\u201d The \r\n[L3706] General Social Survey asked 1152 adults to react to this \r\n[L3707] statement.

Ugly fries Few people want to eat discolored \r\n[L3851] french fries. Potatoes are kept refrigerated before being \r\n[L3852] cut for french fries to prevent spoiling and preserve flavor. \r\n[L3853] But immediate processing of cold potatoes causes discol\ufffeoring due to complex chemical reactions. The potatoes \r\n[L3854] must therefore be brought to room temperature before \r\n[L3855] processing. Researchers want to design an experiment in \r\n[L3856] which tasters will rate the color and flavor of french fries \r\n[L3857] prepared from several groups of potatoes. The potatoes \r\n[L3858] will be freshly picked or stored for a month at room tem\ufffeperature or stored for a month refrigerated. They will then \r\n[L3859] be sliced and cooked either immediately or after an hour \r\n[L3860] at room temperature.

Which of the following statements best \r\n[L4165] describes the distribution of home prices in Sarasota?\r\n[L4166] (a) The distribution is most likely skewed to the left, and \r\n[L4167] the mean is greater than the median.\r\n[L4168] (b) The distribution is most likely skewed to the left, and \r\n[L4169] the mean is less than the median.\r\n[L4170] (c) The distribution is roughly symmetric with a few high \r\n[L4171] outliers, and the mean is approximately equal to the median.\r\n[L4172] (d) The distribution is most likely skewed to the right, and \r\n[L4173] the mean is greater than the median.\r\n[L4174] (e) The distribution is most likely skewed to the right, and \r\n[L4175] the mean is less than the median.\r\n[L4176] AP1.2. A child is 40 inches tall, which places her at the \r\n[L4177] 90th percentile of all children of similar age. The heights for \r\n[L4178] children of this age form an approximately Normal distribu\ufffetion with a mean of 38 inches. Based on this information, \r\n[L4179] what is the standard deviation of the heights of all children \r\n[L4180] of this age?\r\n[L4181] (a) 0.20 inches (c) 0.65 inches (e) 1.56 inches \r\n[L4182] (b) 0.31 inches (d) 1.21 inches\r\n[L4183] AP1.3. A large set of test scores has mean 60 and standard \r\n[L4184] deviation 18. If each score is doubled, and then 5 is sub\ufffetracted from the result, the mean and standard deviation of \r\n[L4185] the new scores are\r\n[L4186] (a) mean 115; std. dev. 31. (d) mean 120; std. dev. 31.\r\n[L4187] (b) mean 115; std. dev. 36. (e) mean 120; std. dev. 36.\r\n[L4188] (c) mean 120; std. dev. 6.\r\n[L4189] AP1.4. For a certain experiment, the available experimen\ufffetal units are eight rats, of which four are female (F1, F2, \r\n[L4190] F3, F4) and four are male (M1, M2, M3, M4). There are to \r\n[L4191] be four treatment groups, A, B, C, and D. If a randomized \r\n[L4192] block design is used, with the experimental units blocked \r\n[L4193] by gender, which of the following assignments of treat\ufffements is impossible?\r\n[L4194] (a) A \u2192 (F1, M1), B \u2192 (F2, M2),\r\n[L4195] C \u2192 (F3, M3), D \u2192 (F4, M4)\r\n[L4196] (b) A \u2192 (F1, M2), B \u2192 (F2, M3),\r\n[L4197] C \u2192 (F3, M4), D \u2192 (F4, M1)\r\n[L4198] (c) A \u2192 (F1, M2), B \u2192 (F3, F2),\r\n[L4199] C \u2192 (F4, M1), D \u2192 (M3, M4)\r\n[L4200] (d) A \u2192 (F4, M1), B \u2192 (F2, M3),\r\n[L4201] C \u2192 (F3, M2), D \u2192 (F1, M4)\r\n[L4202] (e) A \u2192 (F4, M1), B \u2192 (F1, M4),\r\n[L4203] C \u2192 (F3, M2), D \u2192 (F2, M3)\r\n[L4204] AP1.5. For a biology project, you measure the weight in\r\n[L4205] grams (g) and the tail length in millimeters (mm) of a \r\n[L4206] group of mice. The equation of the least-squares line for \r\n[L4207] predicting tail length from weight is\r\n[L4208] predicted tail length = 20 + 3 \u00d7 weight\r\n[L4209] Which of the following is not correct?\r\n[L4210] (a) The slope is 3, which indicates that a mouse\u2019s weight \r\n[L4211] should increase by about 3 grams for each additional mil\ufffelimeter of tail length.\r\n[L4212] (b) The predicted tail length of a mouse that weighs \r\n[L4213] 38 grams is 134 millimeters.\r\n[L4214] Cumulative AP Practice Test 1 \r\n[L4215] Section I: Multiple Choice Choose the best answer for Questions AP1.1 to AP1.14.","[L4216] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 73 / 75>","[L4217] Cumulative AP Practice Test 1 277\r\n[L4218] (c) By looking at the equation of the least-squares line, you \r\n[L4219] can see that the correlation between weight and tail length \r\n[L4220] is positive.\r\n[L4221] (d) If you had measured the tail length in centimeters \r\n[L4222] instead of millimeters, the slope of the regression line \r\n[L4223] would have been 3/10 = 0.3.\r\n[L4224] (e) One mouse weighed 29 grams and had a tail length of \r\n[L4225] 100 millimeters. The residual for this mouse is \u22127.\r\n[L4226] AP1.6. The figure below shows a Normal density curve. \r\n[L4227] Which of the following gives the best estimates for the \r\n[L4228] mean and standard deviation of this Normal distribution?\r\n[L4229] 0.000\r\n[L4230] 0.002\r\n[L4231] 0.004\r\n[L4232] 0.006\r\n[L4233] 0.008\r\n[L4234] 0.010\r\n[L4235] 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\r\n[L4236] (a) \u03bc = 200, \u03c3 = 50 (d) \u03bc = 225, \u03c3 = 25\r\n[L4237] (b) \u03bc = 200, \u03c3 = 25 (e) \u03bc = 225, \u03c3 = 275 \r\n[L4238] (c) \u03bc = 225, \u03c3 = 50\r\n[L4239] AP1.7. The owner of a chain of supermarkets notices that \r\n[L4240] there is a positive correlation between the sales of beer \r\n[L4241] and the sales of ice cream over the course of the previous \r\n[L4242] year. During seasons when sales of beer were above aver\ufffeage, sales of ice cream also tended to be above average. \r\n[L4243] Likewise, during seasons when sales of beer were below \r\n[L4244] average, sales of ice cream also tended to be below average. \r\n[L4245] Which of the following would be a valid conclusion from \r\n[L4246] these facts?\r\n[L4247] (a) Sales records must be in error. There should be no \r\n[L4248] association between beer and ice cream sales.\r\n[L4249] (b) Evidently, for a significant proportion of customers of \r\n[L4250] these supermarkets, drinking beer causes a desire for ice \r\n[L4251] cream or eating ice cream causes a thirst for beer.\r\n[L4252] (c) A scatterplot of monthly ice cream sales versus \r\n[L4253] monthly beer sales would show that a straight line describes\r\n[L4254] the pattern in the plot, but it would have to be a horizontal \r\n[L4255] line.\r\n[L4256] (d) There is a clear negative association between beer sales \r\n[L4257] and ice cream sales.\r\n[L4258] (e) The positive correlation is most likely a result of the \r\n[L4259] lurking variable temperature; that is, as temperatures \r\n[L4260] increase, so do both beer sales and ice cream sales.\r\n[L4261] AP1.8. Here are the IQ scores of 10 randomly chosen \r\n[L4262] fifth-grade students:\r\n[L4263] 145 139 126 122 125 130 96 110 118 118\r\n[L4264] Which of the following statements about this data set is \r\n[L4265] not true?\r\n[L4266] (a) The student with an IQ of 96 is considered an outlier \r\n[L4267] by the 1.5 \u00d7 IQR rule.\r\n[L4268] (b) The five-number summary of the 10 IQ scores is 96, \r\n[L4269] 118, 123.5, 130, 145.\r\n[L4270] (c) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4271] mean of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be higher than \r\n[L4272] the mean of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4273] (d) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4274] standard deviation of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be \r\n[L4275] lower than the standard deviation of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4276] (e) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4277] IQR of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be lower than the \r\n[L4278] IQR of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4279] AP1.9. Before he goes to bed each night, Mr. Kleen pours \r\n[L4280] dishwasher powder into his dishwasher and turns it on. \r\n[L4281] Each morning, Mrs. Kleen weighs the box of dishwasher \r\n[L4282] powder. From an examination of the data, she concludes \r\n[L4283] that Mr. Kleen dispenses a rather consistent amount \r\n[L4284] of powder each night. Which of the following statements \r\n[L4285] is true?\r\n[L4286] I. There is a high positive correlation between the \r\n[L4287] number of days that have passed since the box of dish\ufffewasher powder was opened and the amount of powder \r\n[L4288] left in the box.\r\n[L4289] II. A scatterplot with days since purchase as the explana\ufffetory variable and amount of dishwasher powder used as \r\n[L4290] the response variable would display a strong positive \r\n[L4291] association.\r\n[L4292] III. The correlation between the amount of powder left in \r\n[L4293] the box and the amount of powder used should be \u22121.\r\n[L4294] (a) I only (c) III only (e) I, II, and III\r\n[L4295] (b) II only (d) II and III only\r\n[L4296] AP1.10. The General Social Survey (GSS), conducted by \r\n[L4297] the National Opinion Research Center at the University \r\n[L4298] of Chicago, is a major source of data on social attitudes in \r\n[L4299] the United States. Once each year, 1500 adults are inter\ufffeviewed in their homes all across the country. The subjects \r\n[L4300] are asked their opinions about sex and marriage, attitudes \r\n[L4301] toward women, welfare, foreign policy, and many other \r\n[L4302] issues. The GSS begins by selecting a sample of counties \r\n[L4303] from the 3000 counties in the country. The counties are \r\n[L4304] divided into urban, rural, and suburban; a separate sample \r\n[L4305] is chosen at random from each group. This is a\r\n[L4306] (a) simple random sample.\r\n[L4307] (b) systematic random sample.","[L4308] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 74 / 75>","[L4309] 278 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L4310] Section II: Free Response Show all your work.

You are planning an experiment to determine \r\n[L4317] the effect of the brand of gasoline and the weight of a car \r\n[L4318] on gas mileage measured in miles per gallon. You will use \r\n[L4319] a single test car, adding weights so that its total weight is \r\n[L4320] 3000, 3500, or 4000 pounds. The car will drive on a test \r\n[L4321] track at each weight using each of Amoco, Marathon, and \r\n[L4322] Speedway gasoline. Which is the best way to organize the \r\n[L4323] study?\r\n[L4324] (a) Start with 3000 pounds and Amoco and run the car on \r\n[L4325] the test track. Then do 3500 and 4000 pounds. Change to \r\n[L4326] Marathon and go through the three weights in order. Then \r\n[L4327] change to Speedway and do the three weights in order\r\n[L4328] once more.\r\n[L4329] (b) Start with 3000 pounds and Amoco and run the car \r\n[L4330] on the test track. Then change to Marathon and then to \r\n[L4331] Speedway without changing the weight. Then add weights \r\n[L4332] to get 3500 pounds and go through the three gasolines in \r\n[L4333] the same order. Then change to 4000 pounds and do the \r\n[L4334] three gasolines in order again.\r\n[L4335] (c) Choose a gasoline at random, and run the car with this \r\n[L4336] gasoline at 3000, 3500, and 4000 pounds in order. Choose \r\n[L4337] one of the two remaining gasolines at random and again \r\n[L4338] run the car at 3000, then 3500, then 4000 pounds. Do the \r\n[L4339] same with the last gasoline.\r\n[L4340] (d) There are nine combinations of weight and gasoline. \r\n[L4341] Run the car several times using each of these combina\ufffetions.

Those who advocate for monetary incentives in \r\n[L4403] a work environment claim that this type of incentive has \r\n[L4404] the greatest appeal because it allows the winners to do what \r\n[L4405] they want with their winnings. Those in favor of tangible \r\n[L4406] incentives argue that money lacks the emotional appeal of, \r\n[L4407] say, a weekend for two at a romantic country inn or elegant \r\n[L4408] hotel or a weeklong trip to Europe.\r\n[L4409] A few years ago a national tire company, in an effort to \r\n[L4410] improve sales of a new line of tires, decided to test which \r\n[L4411] method\u2014offering cash incentives or offering non-cash \r\n[L4412] prizes such as vacations\u2014was more successful in increas\ufffeing sales.

Not only are there national brands for \r\n[L4428] most products, but many stores have their own in-house \r\n[L4429] brands. Since shelf space is not infinite, the question is \r\n[L4430] how many linear feet to allocate to each product and \r\n[L4431] which shelf (top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle) \r\n[L4432] to put it on. The middle shelf is the most popular and lu\ufffecrative, since many shoppers, if undecided, will simply \r\n[L4433] pick the product that is at eye level. \r\n[L4434] A local store that sells many upscale goods is trying to \r\n[L4435] determine how much shelf space to allocate to its own \r\n[L4436] brand of men\u2019s personal-grooming products.

By the end of the chapter, you\u2019ll be ready to interpret \r\n[L7] the results of this study.\r\n[L8] Early research showed that magnetic fields affected living tissue in humans. Some doc\ufffetors have begun to use magnets to treat patients with chronic pain. Scientists wondered \r\n[L9] whether this type of therapy really worked. They designed a study to find out.\r\n[L10] Fifty patients with chronic pain were recruited for the study. A doctor identified a painful \r\n[L11] site on each patient and asked him or her to rate the pain on a scale from 0 (mild pain) to \r\n[L12] 10 (severe pain). Then, the doctor selected a sealed envelope containing a magnet from a \r\n[L13] box that contained both active and inactive magnets. That way, neither the doctor nor the \r\n[L14] patient knew which type of magnet was being used. The chosen magnet was applied to \r\n[L15] the site of the pain for 45 minutes. After \u201ctreatment,\u201d each patient was again asked to rate \r\n[L16] the level of pain from 0 to 10.\r\n[L17] In all, 29 patients were given active magnets and 21 patients received inactive magnets. \r\n[L18] All but one of the patients rated their initial pain as an 8, 9, or 10.

Here are \r\n[L26] some examples:\r\n[L27] sThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\n[L28] seat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\n[L29] sAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\n[L30] an average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\n[L31] teens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\n[L32] unsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\n[L33] sA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\n[L34] of catching a cold.4\r\n[L35] sFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\n[L36] that listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\n[L37] Can we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\n[L38] depends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\n[L39] look at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\n[L40] Each year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\n[L41] vehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\n[L42] people in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\n[L43] of an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\n[L44] asking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\n[L45] conducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\n[L46] about some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\n[L47] In the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\n[L48] questions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\n[L49] them a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\n[L50] observational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\n[L51] drawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\n[L52] while listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\n[L53] list of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\n[L54] The goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\n[L55] changes in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\n[L56] the ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\n[L57] Here\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\n[L58] ACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\n[L59] MATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\n[L60] clock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\n[L61] Confucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget.

To answer the question, we will interview 16- to 20-year-olds \r\n[L70] who live in the United States and drive. Ideally, we would ask them all (take a \r\n[L71] census). But contacting every driver in this age group wouldn\u2019t be practical: it \r\n[L72] would take too much time and cost too much money. Instead, we put the question \r\n[L73] to a sample chosen to represent the entire population of young drivers.\r\n[L74] 4.1\r\n[L75] In Section 4.1, \r\n[L76] you\u2019ll learn about: \r\n[L77] sThe idea of a sample \r\n[L78] survey\r\n[L79] sHow to sample badly\r\n[L80] sHow to sample well: \r\n[L81] Random sampling\r\n[L82] sOther sampling methods\r\n[L83] sInference for sampling\r\n[L84] sSample surveys: What \r\n[L85] can go wrong?\r\n[L86] 1.

Do not look at the numbers until it is time for you to do the \r\n[L89] experiment.\r\n[L90] 3. Flip a coin to decide which of you is Student A and which is Student B. \r\n[L91] Shuffle the index cards and deal one face down to each partner.\r\n[L92] 4. Student A will attempt a memory task while Student B keeps time.\r\n[L93] Directions: Study the pairs of numbers on the index card for 30 seconds. Then \r\n[L94] turn the card over. Recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.). Then tell your part\ufffener (Student B) what you think the numbers on the card are. Student B will \r\n[L95] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L96] 5. Now it\u2019s Student B\u2019s turn to do a memory task while Student A records the data.\r\n[L97] Directions: Your partner will read the pairs of numbers on your index card aloud \r\n[L98] three times slowly. Next, you will recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.) and \r\n[L99] then tell your partner what you think the numbers on the card are. Student A will \r\n[L100] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L101] 6. Your teacher will scale and label axes on the board for parallel dotplots of the re\ufffesults. Plot the number of pairs you remembered correctly on the appropriate graph.\r\n[L102] 7. Did students in your class remember numbers better when they saw them or \r\n[L103] when they heard them? Give appropriate evidence to support your answer.\r\n[L104] 8. Based on the results of this experiment, can we conclude that people in gen\ufffeeral remember better when they see than when they hear? Why or why not?\r\n[L105] DEFINITION: Population and sample\r\n[L106] The population in a statistical study is the entire group of individuals about which we \r\n[L107] want information.\r\n[L108] A sample is the part of the population from which we actually collect information. We \r\n[L109] use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\n[L110] The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\n[L111] sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\n[L112] Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\n[L113] uses of sampling.","[L114] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L115] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","[L116] 208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L117] EXAMPLE\r\n[L118] EXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\n[L119] Populations and samples\r\n[L120] PROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n[L121] (a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\n[L122] before shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\n[L123] five pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\n[L124] moisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n[L125] (b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\n[L126] SOLUTION:\r\n[L127] (a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\n[L128] that are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n[L129] (b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\n[L130] For Practice Try Exercise 1\r\n[L131] The Idea of a Sample Survey\r\n[L132] We often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\n[L133] basis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\n[L134] and ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\n[L135] cream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\n[L136] whole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\n[L137] varied population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\n[L138] The first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\n[L139] what population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\n[L140] exactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\n[L141] We reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\n[L142] example. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\n[L143] or \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\n[L144] or more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example. We\u2019ll avoid this more \r\n[L145] restrictive terminology.\r\n[L146] Sample survey\r\n[L147] How Does the Current Population Survey Work?\r\n[L148] A sample survey\r\n[L149] One of the most important government sample surveys in the United States is \r\n[L150] the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS contacts about 60,000 \r\n[L151] households each month. It produces the monthly unemployment rate and much ","[L152] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://78b0ae7eaeb088a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":58525,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L153] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>","[L154] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 209\r\n[L155] The final step in planning a sample survey is to decide how to choose a sample \r\n[L156] from the population. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some good and not-so-good sam\ufffepling methods.\r\n[L157] How to Sample Badly\r\n[L158] How can we choose a sample that we can trust to represent the population? \r\n[L159] The easiest\u2014but not the best\u2014sampling method just chooses individuals who \r\n[L160] are close by. Suppose we\u2019re interested in finding out how long students at a \r\n[L161] large high school spent on homework last week, for example. We might go to \r\n[L162] the school library and ask the first 30 students we see about their homework \r\n[L163] time. A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\n[L164] easiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\n[L165] produce unrepresentative data.\r\n[L166] other economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\n[L167] specify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\n[L168] all U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\n[L169] not in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\n[L170] news refers to this specific population.\r\n[L171] What does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\n[L172] for example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\n[L173] she is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\n[L174] first asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\n[L175] work in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\n[L176] you are not in the labor force.\r\n[L177] If you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\n[L178] you did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\n[L179] you are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\n[L180] pay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\n[L181] because of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason. An unemployment rate \r\n[L182] of 9.7% means that 9.7% of the sample was unemployed, using the exact CPS \r\n[L183] definitions of both \u201clabor force\u201d and \u201cunemployed.\u201d\r\n[L184] DEFINITION: Convenience sample\r\n[L185] Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach results in a convenience sample.\r\n[L186] What\u2019s wrong with our convenience sample of students in the library? It\u2019s \r\n[L187] unlikely that this sample represents the homework habits of all students at the \r\n[L188] school well. In fact, we\u2019d expect the sample to overestimate the average homework \r\n[L189] time in the population since students who hang out in the library might tend to \r\n[L190] be more studious. This is bias: using a method that will consistently overestimate \r\n[L191] or underestimate the value you want to know.","[L192] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bea60ae105051c9#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_4.jpg","size_bytes":53957,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L193] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>","[L194] 210 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L195] EXAMPLE\r\n[L196] DEFINITION: Bias\r\n[L197] The design of a statistical study shows bias if it systematically favors certain outcomes.\r\n[L198] Convenience samples are almost guaranteed to show bias. So are voluntary \r\n[L199] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L200] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L201] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L202] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L203] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L204] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L205] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L206] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L207] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L208] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L209] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L210] to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\n[L211] Illegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\n[L212] Online polls\r\n[L213] Former CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\n[L214] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L215] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L216] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L217] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L218] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L219] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L220] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L221] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L222] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L223] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L224] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L225] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L226] the direction of the bias. Suppose you were asked, \u201cExplain how using a convenience sample of students in \r\n[L227] your statistics class to estimate the proportion of all high school students who own a graphing calculator could \r\n[L228] result in bias.\u201d You might respond, \u201cThis sample would probably include a much higher proportion of students \r\n[L229] with a graphing calculator than in the population at large because a graphing calculator is required for the \r\n[L230] statistics class. That is, this method would probably lead to an overestimate of the actual population proportion.\u201d\r\n[L231] www\r\n[L232] For Practice Try Exercise 5","[L233] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6ad2f94da5ad6a1#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_5.jpg","size_bytes":57756,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L234] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>","[L235] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 211\r\n[L236] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L237] For each of the following situations, identify the sampling method used.

Viewers were invited to call one telephone \r\n[L243] number to respond \u201cYes\u201d and another for \u201cNo.\u201d There was a charge for calling either num\ufffeber. More than 186,000 callers responded, and 67% said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n[L244] How to Sample Well: \r\n[L245] Random Sampling\r\n[L246] In a voluntary response sample, people choose whether to respond. In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L247] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L248] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L249] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L250] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L251] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L252] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L253] random sample.\r\n[L254] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L255] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L256] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L257] sample actually selected.\r\n[L258] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L259] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L260] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L261] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L262] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L263] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L264] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L265] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L266] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L267] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L268] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L269] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L270] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L271] if the population is large. Think about the \r\n[L272] Current Population Survey, for example, \r\n[L273] Random sampling","[L274] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://3a54b1107c99c35#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_6.jpg","size_bytes":57187,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L275] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>","[L276] 212 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L277] which must draw a sample of size 60,000 every month from the population of \r\n[L278] over 117 million U.S. households.\r\n[L279] In practice, people use random numbers generated by a computer or calcula\ufffetor to choose samples. If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L280] random digits.\r\n[L281] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L282] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L283] these properties:\r\n[L284] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L285] s The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\n[L286] gives no information about any other part.\r\n[L287] Table D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\n[L288] digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\n[L289] in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\n[L290] the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\n[L291] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L292] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L293] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L294] same length.\r\n[L295] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L296] from Table D.\r\n[L297] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L298] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L299] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L300] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L301] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L302] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L303] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L304] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L305] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L306] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L307] and so on\u2014because the table has no order. We recommend reading across rows \r\n[L308] from left to right.","[L309] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://fed072027c0760d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_7.jpg","size_bytes":43027,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L310] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 75>","[L311] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 213\r\n[L312] Spring Break!\r\n[L313] Choosing an SRS with Table D\r\n[L314] The school newspaper is planning an article on family-friendly \r\n[L315] places to stay over spring break at a nearby beach town.

The applet sampled without replacement from the \u201cPopulation hop\ufffeper,\u201d but the calculator sampled with replacement from the specified population. \r\n[L397] As a result, the calculator sometimes selects the same number more than once in \r\n[L398] a given sample. To deal with this problem, you can generate additional random \r\n[L399] numbers as needed to replace any repeats. Or you can use a method other than \r\n[L400] randInt (like randSamp on the TI-Nspire) to sample without replacement. Refer \r\n[L401] to your device\u2019s reference manual or ask your teacher.\r\n[L402] We can trust results from an SRS, as well as from other types of random samples \r\n[L403] that we will meet later, because the use of impersonal chance avoids bias. Online\r\n[L404] and call-in polls also produce samples. But we can\u2019t trust results from these sam\ufffeples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. The first question to ask about \r\n[L405] any sample is whether it was chosen at random.\r\n[L406] Other Sampling Methods\r\n[L407] The basic idea of sampling is straightforward: take an SRS from the population \r\n[L408] and use your sample results to gain information about the population. Unfor\ufffetunately, it\u2019s usually very difficult to actually get an SRS from the population of \r\n[L409] interest. Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L410] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L411] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L412] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L413] selected.

Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L420] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L421] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L422] between strata.\r\n[L423] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L424] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L425] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L426] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L427] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L428] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L429] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L430] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L431] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size. Not convinced? Try \r\n[L432] the following Activity.\r\n[L433] ACTIVITY Sampling sunflowers\r\n[L434] A British farmer grows sunflowers for making sunflower oil. Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L435] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L436] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L437] money she\u2019ll make from selling them.

How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L481] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L482] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L483] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L484] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L485] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L486] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L487] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L488] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L489] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L490] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L491] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L492] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L493] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups.

They don\u2019t offer the statistical advantage of better information about the \r\n[L507] population that stratified random samples do.

Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L619] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L620] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L621] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L622] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L623] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L624] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L625] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L626] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L627] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L628] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L629] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L630] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L631] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L632] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L633] Sampling Units, or PSUs. Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\n[L634] the 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\n[L635] of the others.\r\n[L636] Stage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\n[L637] Stratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\n[L638] Stage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\n[L639] units. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\n[L640] Analyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\n[L641] beyond basic statistics. But the SRS is the building block of more elaborate \r\n[L642] methods, and the principles of analysis remain much the same for these other \r\n[L643] methods.\r\n[L644] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L645] The manager of a sports arena wants to learn more about the financial status of the people \r\n[L646] who are attending an NBA basketball game.

Ticket prices for the game vary a \r\n[L647] great deal: seats near the court cost over $100 each, while seats in \r\n[L648] the top rows of the arena cost $25 each. The arena is divided into \r\n[L649] 30 numbered sections, from 101 to 130.

The \r\n[L666] process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\n[L667] called inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\n[L668] we know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\n[L669] response samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\n[L670] the population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\n[L671] selecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\n[L672] Still, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\n[L673] the entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\n[L674] the monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\n[L675] population. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\n[L676] almost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\n[L677] Inference\r\n[L678] ACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\n[L679] MATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\n[L680] other container that students can\u2019t see through\r\n[L681] In this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\n[L682] in relation to the population truth.\r\n[L683] 1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\n[L684] particular color.\r\n[L685] 2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\n[L686] record the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\n[L687] returned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n[L688] 3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\n[L689] is the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\n[L690] center? Is there a clear shape?\r\n[L691] Why can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\n[L692] results of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\n[L693] Because we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\n[L694] govern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\n[L695] results are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\n[L696] random sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\n[L697] the population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\n[L698] sets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\n[L699] for sampling later.\r\n[L700] One point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples. For instance, in the Activity, \r\n[L701] you would get a better estimate of the proportion of red chips in the popula\ufffeMargin of error","[L702] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 16 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://136106c58c36cbc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_15.jpg","size_bytes":54135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L703] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>","[L704] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 221\r\n[L705] tion using random samples of 40 chips than 20 chips. By taking a very large \r\n[L706] sample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\n[L707] about the population.\r\n[L708] The Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\n[L709] expect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\n[L710] of the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n[L711] 3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\n[L712] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L713] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L714] clicked a response.\r\n[L715] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L716] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L717] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L718] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L719] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L720] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L721] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L722] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L723] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L724] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L725] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L726] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L727] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L728] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L729] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L730] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L731] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L732] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L733] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L734] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L735] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L736] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L737] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L738] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L739] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L740] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L741] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L742] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L743] Sampling frame","[L744] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L745] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","[L746] 222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L747] EXAMPLE\r\n[L748] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L749] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L750] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L751] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L752] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L753] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L754] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L755] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L756] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L757] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L758] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L759] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L760] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L761] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L762] refuses to participate.\r\n[L763] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L764] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L765] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L766] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L767] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L768] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L769] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L770] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L771] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L772] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L773] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L774] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L775] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L776] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L777] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L778] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L779] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","[L780] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L781] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","[L782] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L783] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L784] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L785] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L786] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L787] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L788] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L789] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L790] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L791] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L792] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L793] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L794] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L795] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L796] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L797] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L798] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L799] memory. \u201cHave you visited a dentist in the last 6 months?\u201d will often draw a \r\n[L800] \u201cYes\u201d from someone who last visited a dentist 8 months ago.10 Careful training \r\n[L801] of interviewers and careful supervision to avoid variation among the interview\ufffeers can reduce response bias.

Different questions \r\n[L818] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L819] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L820] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L821] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L822] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L823] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L824] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L825] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L826] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L827] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L828] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L829] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L830] 1.

Here is the actual question:\r\n[L837] It is estimated that disposable diapers account for less than 2% of the trash in today\u2019s \r\n[L838] landfills. In contrast, beverage containers, third-class mail and yard wastes are estimated\r\n[L839] to account for about 21% of the trash in landfills. Given this, in your opinion, would it \r\n[L840] be fair to ban disposable diapers?11\r\n[L841] Explain how the wording of the question could result in bias. Be sure to specify the direc\ufffetion of the bias.\r\n[L842] Wording of questions\r\n[L843] ?\r\n[L844] THINK\r\n[L845] ABOUT\r\n[L846] IT\r\n[L847] EXAMPLE","[L848] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 20 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://248f22efb09cc94#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_19.jpg","size_bytes":52135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L849] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>","[L850] s A sample survey selects a sample from the population of all individuals \r\n[L851] about which we desire information. We base conclusions about the \r\n[L852] population on data from the sample. It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L853] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L854] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L855] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L856] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L857] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L858] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L859] process.\r\n[L860] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L861] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L862] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L863] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L864] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L865] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L866] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L867] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L868] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L869] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L870] prone to large bias.\r\n[L871] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L872] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L873] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L874] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L875] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L876] errors. These have nothing to do with choosing a sample\u2014they are \r\n[L877] present even in a census. The single biggest problem for sample surveys \r\n[L878] is nonresponse: people can\u2019t be contacted or refuse to answer. Incorrect \r\n[L879] answers by respondents can lead to response bias. Finally, the exact \r\n[L880] wording of questions has a big influence on the answers.\r\n[L881] Summary SECTION 4.1\r\n[L882] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 225\r\n[L883] 4.1 TECHNOLOGY CORNER\r\n[L884] Choosing an SRS..................................................................... page 214\r\n[L885] TI-Nspire instructions in Appendix B","[L886] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://af94379ba136b08#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_20.jpg","size_bytes":47602,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 75>","[L888] 226 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L889] 1. Students as customers A high school\u2019s student \r\n[L890] newspaper plans to survey local businesses about the \r\n[L891] importance of students as customers. From telephone \r\n[L892] book listings, the newspaper staff chooses 150 busi\ufffenesses at random. Of these, 73 return the question\ufffenaire mailed by the staff. Identify the population and \r\n[L893] the sample.\r\n[L894] 2. Student archaeologists An archaeological dig turns \r\n[L895] up large numbers of pottery shards, broken stone \r\n[L896] tools, and other artifacts. Students working on the \r\n[L897] project classify each artifact and assign it a number. \r\n[L898] The counts in different categories are important for \r\n[L899] understanding the site, so the project director chooses \r\n[L900] 2% of the artifacts at random and checks the students\u2019 \r\n[L901] work. Identify the population and the sample.\r\n[L902] 3. Sampling stuffed envelopes A large retailer prepares \r\n[L903] its customers\u2019 monthly credit card bills using an \r\n[L904] automatic machine that folds the bills, stuffs them \r\n[L905] into envelopes, and seals the envelopes for mailing. \r\n[L906] Are the envelopes completely sealed? Inspectors \r\n[L907] choose 40 envelopes from the 1000 stuffed each hour \r\n[L908] for visual inspection. Identify the population and the \r\n[L909] sample.\r\n[L910] 4. Customer satisfaction A department store mails \r\n[L911] a customer satisfaction survey to people who make \r\n[L912] credit card purchases at the store. This month, 45,000 \r\n[L913] people made credit card purchases. Surveys are \r\n[L914] mailed to 1000 of these people, chosen at random, \r\n[L915] and 137 people return the survey form. Identify the \r\n[L916] population and the sample.\r\n[L917] 5. Call the shots A newspaper advertisement for an \r\n[L918] upcoming TV show said: \u201cShould handgun control \r\n[L919] be tougher? You call the shots in a special call-in \r\n[L920] poll tonight. If yes, call 1-900-720-6181. If no, call \r\n[L921] 1-900-720-6182. Charge is 50 cents for the first \r\n[L922] minute.\u201d Explain why this opinion poll is almost \r\n[L923] certainly biased.\r\n[L924] 6. Explain it to the congresswoman You are on the \r\n[L925] staff of a member of Congress who is considering a \r\n[L926] bill that would provide government-sponsored insur\ufffeance for nursing-home care. You report that 1128 letters \r\n[L927] have been received on the issue, of which 871 oppose \r\n[L928] the legislation. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that most of my con\ufffestituents oppose the bill. I thought it would be quite \r\n[L929] popular,\u201d says the congresswoman. Are you convinced \r\n[L930] that a majority of the voters oppose the bill? How would \r\n[L931] you explain the statistical issue to the congresswoman?\r\n[L932] 7. Instant opinion A recent online poll posed the ques\ufffetion \u201cShould female athletes be paid the same as men \r\n[L933] for the work they do?\u2019\u2019 In all, 13,147 (44%) said \u201cYes,\u2019\u2019 \r\n[L934] 15,182 (50%) said \u201cNo,\u2019\u2019 and the remaining 1448 said \r\n[L935] \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d In spite of the large sample size for this \r\n[L936] survey, we can\u2019t trust the result. Why not?\r\n[L937] 8. Online polls In June 2008, Parade magazine posed \r\n[L938] the following question: \u201cShould drivers be banned \r\n[L939] from using all cell phones?\u201d Readers were encour\ufffeaged to vote online at parade.com. The July 13, 2008, \r\n[L940] issue of Parade reported the results: 2407 \r\n[L941] (85%) said \u201cYes\u201d and 410 (15%) said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n[L942] (a) What type of sample did the Parade survey \r\n[L943] obtain?\r\n[L944] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n[L945] 85% probably higher or lower than the true percent \r\n[L946] of all adults who believe that cell phone use while \r\n[L947] driving should be banned? Why?\r\n[L948] 9. Sleepless nights How much sleep do high school \r\n[L949] students get on a typical school night? An interested \r\n[L950] student designed a survey to find out. To make data \r\n[L951] collection easier, the student surveyed the first 100 \r\n[L952] students to arrive at school on a particular morning. \r\n[L953] These students reported an average of 7.2 hours of \r\n[L954] sleep on the previous night.\r\n[L955] (a) What type of sample did the student obtain?\r\n[L956] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n[L957] 7.2 hours probably higher or lower than the true aver\ufffeage amount of sleep last night for all students at the \r\n[L958] school? Why?\r\n[L959] 10. Sampling at the mall You have probably seen the \r\n[L960] mall interviewer, approaching people passing by with \r\n[L961] clipboard in hand. Explain why even a large sample \r\n[L962] of mall shoppers would not provide a trustworthy \r\n[L963] estimate of the current unemployment rate.\r\n[L964] 11. Do you trust the Internet? You want to ask a sample \r\n[L965] of high school students the question \u201cHow much do \r\n[L966] you trust information about health that you find on \r\n[L967] the Internet\u2014a great deal, somewhat, not much, or \r\n[L968] not at all?\u201d You try out this and other questions on a \r\n[L969] pilot group of 5 students chosen from your class. The \r\n[L970] class members are listed at top right.\r\n[L971] (a) Explain how you would use a line of Table D to \r\n[L972] choose an SRS of 5 students from the following list. \r\n[L973] Explain your method clearly enough for a classmate \r\n[L974] to obtain your results.\r\n[L975] pg 208\r\n[L976] pg 210\r\n[L977] pg 213\r\n[L978] SECTION 4.1 Exercises\r\n[L979] www","[L980] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 22 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6ed199a819f4209#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_21.jpg","size_bytes":69624,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L981] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 75>","[L982] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 227\r\n[L983] (b) Use line 107 to select the sample.

Sampling the forest To gather data on a 1200-acre \r\n[L1013] pine forest in Louisiana, the U.S. Forest Service laid a \r\n[L1014] grid of 1410 equally spaced circular plots over a map \r\n[L1015] of the forest. A ground survey visited a sample of 10% \r\n[L1016] of these plots.12\r\n[L1017] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table D \r\n[L1018] to choose an SRS of 141 plots.

Sampling gravestones The local genealogical society \r\n[L1023] in Coles County, Illinois, has compiled records on all \r\n[L1024] 55,914 gravestones in cemeteries in the county for the \r\n[L1025] years 1825 to 1985. Historians plan to use these records \r\n[L1026] to learn about African Americans in Coles County\u2019s his\ufffetory. They first choose an SRS of 395 records to check \r\n[L1027] their accuracy by visiting the actual gravestones.13\r\n[L1028] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table \r\n[L1029] D to choose the SRS. Your description should be \r\n[L1030] clear enough for a classmate to obtain your results.\r\n[L1031] (b) Use your method from (a) to choose the first \r\n[L1032] 3 gravestones.\r\n[L1033] 15. Random digits In using Table D repeatedly to \r\n[L1034] choose random samples, you should not always begin \r\n[L1035] at the same place, such as line 101. Why not?\r\n[L1036] 16. Random digits Which of the following statements \r\n[L1037] are true of a table of random digits, and which are \r\n[L1038] false? Briefly explain your answers.\r\n[L1039] (a) There are exactly four 0s in each row of 40 digits.\r\n[L1040] (b) Each pair of digits has chance 1/100 of being 00.\r\n[L1041] (c) The digits 0000 can never appear as a group, \r\n[L1042] because this pattern is not random.\r\n[L1043] 17. iPhones Suppose 1000 iPhones are produced at a \r\n[L1044] factory today. Management would like to ensure \r\n[L1045] that the phones\u2019 display screens meet their quality \r\n[L1046] standards before shipping them to retail stores. Since \r\n[L1047] it takes about 10 minutes to inspect an individual \r\n[L1048] phone\u2019s display screen, managers decide to inspect a \r\n[L1049] sample of 20 phones from the day\u2019s production.\r\n[L1050] (a) Explain why it would be difficult for managers to \r\n[L1051] inspect an SRS of 20 iPhones that are produced today.\r\n[L1052] (b) An eager employee suggests that it would be easy \r\n[L1053] to inspect the last 20 iPhones that were produced \r\n[L1054] today. Why isn\u2019t this a good idea?\r\n[L1055] (c) Another employee recommends inspecting every \r\n[L1056] fiftieth iPhone that is produced. Explain carefully \r\n[L1057] why this sampling method is not an SRS.\r\n[L1058] 18. Dead trees On the west side of Rocky Mountain \r\n[L1059] National Park, many mature pine trees are dying due \r\n[L1060] to infestation by pine beetles. Scientists would like to \r\n[L1061] use sampling to estimate the proportion of all pine \r\n[L1062] trees in the area that have been infected.\r\n[L1063] (a) Explain why it wouldn\u2019t be practical for scientists \r\n[L1064] to obtain an SRS in this setting.\r\n[L1065] (b) A possible alternative would be to use every pine \r\n[L1066] tree along the park\u2019s main road as a sample. Why is \r\n[L1067] this sampling method biased?\r\n[L1068] (c) Suppose that a more complicated random sam\ufffepling plan is carried out, and that 35% of the pine trees \r\n[L1069] in the sample are infested by the pine beetle. Can \r\n[L1070] scientists conclude that 35% of all the pine trees on the \r\n[L1071] west side of the park are infested? Why or why not?\r\n[L1072] 19. Who goes to the convention?

It decides to choose those who will \r\n[L1087] go by random selection. How will you label the two \r\n[L1088] strata? Use Table D, beginning at line 123, to choose \r\n[L1089] a stratified random sample of 4 students and 2 faculty \r\n[L1090] members.\r\n[L1091] 20. Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\n[L1092] stratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\n[L1093] records of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\n[L1094] stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\n[L1095] and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\n[L1096] One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\n[L1097] these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\n[L1098] amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000. Using these \r\n[L1099] groups as strata, you decide to verify all the largest \r\n[L1100] accounts and to sample 5% of the midsize accounts \r\n[L1101] and 1% of the small accounts. How would you label \r\n[L1102] the two strata from which you will sample? Use Table \r\n[L1103] D, starting at line 115, to select only the first 3 \r\n[L1104] accounts from each of these strata.\r\n[L1105] 21. Go Blue! Michigan Stadium, also known as \u201cThe Big \r\n[L1106] House,\u201d seats over 100,000 fans for a football game. \r\n[L1107] The University of Michigan athletic department plans \r\n[L1108] to conduct a survey about concessions that are sold \r\n[L1109] during games. Tickets are most expensive for seats \r\n[L1110] near the field and on the sideline. The cheapest seats \r\n[L1111] are high up in the end zones (where one of the au\ufffethors sat as a student).

The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L1153] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L1154] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L1155] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L1156] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L1157] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L1158] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L1159] might be preferable to an SRS in this case. What \r\n[L1160] would you use as strata?\r\n[L1161] (b) Why might a cluster sample be a simpler option? \r\n[L1162] What would you use as clusters?\r\n[L1163] 23. Is it an SRS? A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L1164] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L1165] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L1166] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L1167] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L1168] Explain your answer.\r\n[L1169] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L1170] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L1171] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L1172] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L1173] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L1174] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L1175] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L1176] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L1177] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L1178] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L1179] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L1180] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L1181] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L1182] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L1183] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L1184] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L1185] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L1186] method?\r\n[L1187] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L1188] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L1189] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L1190] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L1191] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L1192] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L1193] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L1194] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1195] sample.\r\n[L1196] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L1197] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L1198] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L1199] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L1200] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L1201] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L1202] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L1203] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L1204] pg 218","[L1205] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1206] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","[L1207] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L1208] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1209] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200.

Then explain carefully why a system\ufffeatic sample is not an SRS.\r\n[L1214] 27. Sampling frame Ideally, the sampling frame in a \r\n[L1215] sample survey should list every individual in the \r\n[L1216] population, but in practice, this is often difficult. \r\n[L1217] Suppose that a sample of households in a community \r\n[L1218] is selected at random from the telephone directory. \r\n[L1219] Explain how this sampling method results in under\ufffecoverage that could lead to bias.\r\n[L1220] 28. Sampling frame Refer to the previous exercise. It is \r\n[L1221] more common in telephone surveys to use random \r\n[L1222] digit dialing equipment that selects the last four digits \r\n[L1223] of a telephone number at random after being given \r\n[L1224] the exchange (the first three digits).

You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\n[L1230] to conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\n[L1231] allow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\n[L1232] seats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\n[L1233] you randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\n[L1234] stadium. During the game, you ask the fans in those \r\n[L1235] seats how much they spent that day.\r\n[L1236] (a) Provide a reason why this survey might yield a \r\n[L1237] biased result.\r\n[L1238] (b) Explain whether the reason you provided in (a) is \r\n[L1239] a sampling error or a nonsampling error.\r\n[L1240] 30.

Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\n[L1248] sampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\n[L1249] the United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n[L1250] 5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\n[L1251] estimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n[L1252] (a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n[L1253] (b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\n[L1254] survey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n[L1255] 32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\n[L1256] in telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\n[L1257] call is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\n[L1258] The Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\n[L1259] nonresponse to a government survey of households \r\n[L1260] in Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\n[L1261] July 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\n[L1262] and 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\n[L1263] period versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\n[L1264] period.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\n[L1265] rate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\n[L1266] nonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n[L1267] 33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n[L1268] 31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\n[L1269] answer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\n[L1270] drove through, how many of them were red when you \r\n[L1271] entered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n[L1272] 171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\n[L1273] practical problem with this survey is that people may \r\n[L1274] not give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\n[L1275] of the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n[L1276] 880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n[L1277] 34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\n[L1278] belt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\n[L1279] chosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\n[L1280] they were invited to answer questions that included \r\n[L1281] questions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\n[L1282] always used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\n[L1283] seat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\n[L1284] lots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey.

Sample surveys are one kind of observational\r\n[L1406] study. Other observational studies watch the behavior of animals in the wild or the \r\n[L1407] interactions between teacher and students in the classroom. This section is about \r\n[L1408] statistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\n[L1409] Observational Study versus Experiment\r\n[L1410] In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\n[L1411] ask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\n[L1412] response. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\n[L1413] of a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\n[L1414] DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\n[L1415] An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\n[L1416] does not attempt to influence the responses.\r\n[L1417] An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\n[L1418] responses.\r\n[L1419] The goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\n[L1420] to compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\n[L1421] of an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\n[L1422] response. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\n[L1423] way to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\n[L1424] see the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\n[L1425] is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\n[L1426] data. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\n[L1427] is one of the most important in statistics.\r\n[L1428] Does Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\n[L1429] after Menopause?\r\n[L1430] Observation versus experiment\r\n[L1431] Should women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\n[L1432] production of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\n[L1433] a heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\n[L1434] small compared with the benefits.\r\n[L1435] The evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\n[L1436] hormones with others who were not. But the women who chose to \r\n[L1437] take hormones were richer and better educated and saw doctors \r\n[L1438] more often than women who didn\u2019t take hormones.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L1466] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L1467] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L1468] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L1469] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L1470] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L1471] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L1472] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L1473] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L1474] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L1475] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L1476] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L1477] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L1478] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L1479] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L1480] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L1481] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L1482] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L1483] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L1484] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L1485] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L1486] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L1487] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L1488] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L1489] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L1490] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L1491] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L1492] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L1493] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L1494] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L1495] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L1496] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L1497] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","[L1498] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1499] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","[L1500] Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L1501] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L1502] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L1503] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L1504] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L1505] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L1506] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L1507] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L1508] results of the earlier observational studies.

Suggest a lurking variable that may be confounded \r\n[L1523] with whether families eat dinner together.\r\n[L1524] The Language of Experiments\r\n[L1525] An experiment is a statistical study in which we actually do something (a treat\ufffement) to people, animals, or objects (the experimental units) to observe the re\ufffesponse. Here is the basic vocabulary of experiments.\r\n[L1526] DEFINITION: Treatment, experimental units, subjects\r\n[L1527] A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment.\r\n[L1528] If an experiment has several explanatory variables, a treatment is a combination of \r\n[L1529] specific values of these variables.\r\n[L1530] The experimental units are the smallest collection of individuals to which treatments \r\n[L1531] are applied. When the units are human beings, they often are called subjects.\r\n[L1532] The best way to learn the language of experiments is to practice using it.\r\n[L1533] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1534] are asked to identify a \r\n[L1535] possible confounding \r\n[L1536] variable in a given \r\n[L1537] setting, you are \r\n[L1538] expected to explain how \r\n[L1539] the variable you choose \r\n[L1540] (1) is associated with \r\n[L1541] the explanatory variable \r\n[L1542] and (2) affects the \r\n[L1543] response variable.","[L1544] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1545] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>","[L1546] 234 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1547] EXAMPLE When Will I Ever Use This Stuff?\r\n[L1548] Vocabulary of experiments\r\n[L1549] Researchers at the University of North Carolina were concerned about the \r\n[L1550] increasing dropout rate in the state\u2019s high schools, especially for low-income stu\ufffedents. Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\n[L1551] started to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\n[L1552] To change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\n[L1553] the topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\n[L1554] To test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\n[L1555] the schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\n[L1556] standard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\n[L1557] curriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\n[L1558] years, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\n[L1559] scores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\n[L1560] high school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\n[L1561] greater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\n[L1562] PROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\n[L1563] in the CareerStart experiment.\r\n[L1564] SOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\n[L1565] variable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\n[L1566] compares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\n[L1567] behavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\n[L1568] The previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\n[L1569] trying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\n[L1570] all 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\n[L1571] of schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\n[L1572] researchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\n[L1573] systematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\n[L1574] students from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\n[L1575] program made the difference.\r\n[L1576] Sometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\n[L1577] experiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\n[L1578] treatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\n[L1579] the factors. Here\u2019s an example of a multifactor experiment.\r\n[L1580] Factors\r\n[L1581] Level\r\n[L1582] For Practice Try Exercise 51","[L1583] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://26b92d516ab78a7#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_29.jpg","size_bytes":63833,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1584] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>","[L1585] Section 4.2 Experiments 235\r\n[L1586] EXAMPLE TV Advertising\r\n[L1587] Experiments with multiple explanatory variables\r\n[L1588] What are the effects of repeated exposure to an advertising message? The answer \r\n[L1589] may depend on both the length of the ad and on how often it is repeat\ufffeed. An experiment investigated this question using undergraduate stu\ufffedents as subjects. All subjects viewed a 40-minute television program \r\n[L1590] that included ads for a digital camera. Some subjects saw a 30-second \r\n[L1591] commercial; others, a 90-second version. The same commercial was \r\n[L1592] shown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After viewing, all the \r\n[L1593] subjects answered questions about their recall of the ad, their attitude \r\n[L1594] toward the camera, and their intention to purchase it.21\r\n[L1595] PROBLEM: For the advertising study,\r\n[L1596] (a) identify the explanatory and response variables, and\r\n[L1597] (b) list all the treatments.\r\n[L1598] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1599] (a) This experiment has 2 explanatory variables (factors): \r\n[L1600] length of the commercial and number of repetitions. The response \r\n[L1601] variables include measures of subjects\u2019 recall of the ad, their \r\n[L1602] attitudes about the digital camera, and whether they intend to \r\n[L1603] purchase it.\r\n[L1604] (b) There are 2 different lengths of commercial (30 and 90 seconds) \r\n[L1605] and three different numbers of repetitions (1, 3, and 5). The 6 combi\ufffenations consisting of one level of each factor form the 6 treatments \r\n[L1606] shown in Figure 4.3: (1) 30 seconds, 1 time; (2) 30 seconds, 3 times; \r\n[L1607] (3) 30 seconds, 5 times; (4) 90 seconds, 1 time; (5) 90 seconds, \r\n[L1608] 3 times; (6) 90 seconds, 5 times.\r\n[L1609] This example shows how experiments allow us to study the combined effect of \r\n[L1610] several factors. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\n[L1611] not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\n[L1612] commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\n[L1613] interest. But if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers \r\n[L1614] get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. The two-factor experiment in \r\n[L1615] the TV advertising example will help us find out.\r\n[L1616] How to Experiment Badly \r\n[L1617] Experiments are the preferred method for examining the effect of one variable on \r\n[L1618] another. By imposing the specific treatment of interest and controlling other \r\n[L1619] influences, we can pin down cause and effect. Good designs are essential for \r\n[L1620] effective experiments, just as they are for sampling.

This year, budget cuts will allow the school to offer only an \r\n[L1649] online version of the course. Over the past 10 years, the average SAT \r\n[L1650] score of students in the classroom course was 1620. The online group \r\n[L1651] gets an average score of 1780. That\u2019s roughly 10% higher than the long\ufffetime average for those who took the classroom review course. Is the \r\n[L1652] online course more effective?\r\n[L1653] This experiment has a very simple design. A group of subjects (the \r\n[L1654] students) were exposed to a treatment (the online course), and the \r\n[L1655] outcome (SAT scores) was observed. Here is the design:\r\n[L1656] Students \u2192 Online course \u2192 SAT scores\r\n[L1657] A closer look showed that the students in the online review course \r\n[L1658] were quite different from the students who took the classroom course \r\n[L1659] in past years. They had higher GPAs and were taking more AP classes.\r\n[L1660] The effect of online versus in-class instruction is mixed up with the \r\n[L1661] effect of these lurking variables. Maybe the online students earned \r\n[L1662] higher SAT scores because they were smarter to begin with, not \r\n[L1663] because the online course prepared them better. This confounding \r\n[L1664] prevents us from concluding that the online course is more effective than class\uffferoom instruction.\r\n[L1665] Many laboratory experiments use a design like the one in the online SAT course \r\n[L1666] example:\r\n[L1667] Experimental units \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Measure response\r\n[L1668] In the lab environment, simple designs often work well. Field experiments and \r\n[L1669] experiments with animals or people deal with more variable conditions.

Most well-designed experiments compare \r\n[L1675] two or more treatments.\r\n[L1676] Comparison alone isn\u2019t enough to produce results we can trust. If the treat\ufffements are given to groups that differ greatly when the experiment begins, bias will \r\n[L1677] result.

The solution to the problem of bias in sampling is \r\n[L1684] random selection. In experiments, the solution is random assignment.\r\n[L1685] DEFINITION: Random assignment\r\n[L1686] In an experiment, random assignment means that experimental units are assigned to \r\n[L1687] treatments at random, that is, using some sort of chance process.\r\n[L1688] Let\u2019s look at how random assignment can be used to improve the design of the \r\n[L1689] SAT prep course experiment.\r\n[L1690] SAT Prep: Online versus Classroom\r\n[L1691] How random assignment works\r\n[L1692] This year, the high school has enough budget money to compare the \r\n[L1693] online SAT course with traditional classroom instruction. Fifty students \r\n[L1694] have agreed to participate in an experiment comparing the two instruc\ufffetional methods.\r\n[L1695] PROBLEM: Describe how you would randomly assign 25 students to each of the two \r\n[L1696] methods:\r\n[L1697] (a) Using 50 identical slips of paper\r\n[L1698] (b) Using Table D\r\n[L1699] (c) Using technology\r\n[L1700] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1701] (a) The simplest way would be to use the \u201chat method.\u201d Write each subject\u2019s name on \r\n[L1702] one of the slips. Put all the slips in a hat and mix them thoroughly. Draw them out one \r\n[L1703] at a time until you have 25 slips. These 25 students will take the online course. The \r\n[L1704] remaining 25 students will take the classroom course. Alternatively, you could write \r\n[L1705] \u201conline\u201d on 25 of the slips and \u201cclassroom\u201d on the other 25 slips. Then put the slips in \r\n[L1706] a hat and mix them well. Have students come up one by one and (without looking) pick a slip from the \r\n[L1707] hat. This guarantees 25 students per group, with the treatments assigned by chance.\r\n[L1708] (b) We can use the two-step process from random sampling to do the random assignment.\r\n[L1709] Step 1: Label. Give labels 01, 02, 03, . . . , 49, 50 to the subjects in alphabetical order by last \r\n[L1710] name.\r\n[L1711] Step 2: Table.

It is randomized because the sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments by chance. The diagram in Figure 4.4 presents \r\n[L1725] the details: random assignment, the sizes of the groups and which treatment they \r\n[L1726] receive, and the response variable. There are, as we will see later, statistical rea\ufffesons for using treatment groups that are about equal in size. This type of design is \r\n[L1727] called a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1728] 50 volunteer\r\n[L1729] students\r\n[L1730] Random\r\n[L1731] assignment\r\n[L1732] Group 1\r\n[L1733] 25 students\r\n[L1734] Group 2\r\n[L1735] 25 students\r\n[L1736] Compare\r\n[L1737] SAT scores\r\n[L1738] Treatment 2\r\n[L1739] Classroom\r\n[L1740] Treatment 1\r\n[L1741] Online\r\n[L1742] FIGURE 4.4 Outline of a completely randomized design to compare online and classroom \r\n[L1743] instruction.\r\n[L1744] DEFINITION: Completely randomized design\r\n[L1745] In a completely randomized design, the treatments are assigned to all the experimen\ufffetal units completely by chance.\r\n[L1746] Notice that the definition of a completely randomized design does not require \r\n[L1747] that each treatment be assigned to an equal number of experimental units. It does \r\n[L1748] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L1749] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L1750] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L1751] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L1752] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L1753] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L1754] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1755] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L1756] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L1757] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L1758] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L1759] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L1760] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L1761] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L1762] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L1763] than it really is.\r\n[L1764] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments.

The remaining 20 houses will be given \r\n[L1811] information about energy consumption but no way to monitor their usage. At the end of the year, \r\n[L1812] compare how much electricity was used by the homes in the three groups.\r\n[L1813] Why did we include a control group of 20 houses in the energy conservation \r\n[L1814] experiment? The primary purpose of a control group is to provide a baseline for \r\n[L1815] comparing the effects of the other treatments. Without such a comparison group, \r\n[L1816] we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell whether homes with digital displays or charts used less \r\n[L1817] electricity than homes without such aids.\r\n[L1818] Control group\r\n[L1819] For Practice Try Exercise 61\r\n[L1820] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1821] are asked to describe \r\n[L1822] the design of an experi\ufffement on the AP exam, \r\n[L1823] you won\u2019t get full credit \r\n[L1824] for a diagram like Figure \r\n[L1825] 4.5.

You might be thinking that the change \r\n[L1843] in electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\n[L1844] would tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\n[L1845] Suppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\n[L1846] households might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\n[L1847] whether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\n[L1848] confounding?!)\r\n[L1849] Many experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\n[L1850] group that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\n[L1851] an active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\n[L1852] developed drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\n[L1853] work. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\n[L1854] control group.\r\n[L1855] Some experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group. That\u2019s appropriate \r\n[L1856] if researchers simply want to compare the effects of several treatments, and not \r\n[L1857] to determine whether any of them works better than an inactive treatment. For \r\n[L1858] instance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\n[L1859] of paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\n[L1860] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L1861] Music students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately. Can small-group \r\n[L1862] discussions help? The subjects were 29 students preparing for the end-of-semester per\ufffeformance that is an important part of their grade. Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L1863] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L1864] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L1865] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L1866] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L1867] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment. Follow the model of \r\n[L1868] Figure 4.4.\r\n[L1869] 2. Describe how you would carry out the random assignment. Provide enough detail that \r\n[L1870] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L1871] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L1872] Three Principles of \r\n[L1873] Experimental Design\r\n[L1874] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L1875] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L1876] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L1877] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L1878] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1879] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L1880] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L1881] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L1882] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1883] ?\r\n[L1884] THINK\r\n[L1885] ABOUT\r\n[L1886] IT","[L1887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","[L1888] Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L1889] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1890] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L1891] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L1892] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L1893] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L1894] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L1895] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L1896] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L1897] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L1898] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L1899] between the groups.\r\n[L1900] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L1901] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L1902] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L1903] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L1904] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L1905] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L1906] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L1907] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L1908] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L1909] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L1910] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L1911] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L1912] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L1913] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L1914] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L1915] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L1916] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L1917] experiment.\r\n[L1918] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L1919] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L1920] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks? The Phy\ufffesicians\u2019 Health Study was a medical experiment that helped answer this ques\ufffetion. In fact, the Physicians\u2019 Health Study looked at the effects of two drugs: \r\n[L1921] aspirin and beta-carotene. Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\n[L1922] help prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\n[L1923] male physicians. There were two explanatory variables (factors), each having \r\n[L1924] two levels: aspirin (yes or no) and beta-carotene (yes or no). Combinations of \r\n[L1925] Replication","[L1926] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6cc54f74ebd50cc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_36.jpg","size_bytes":62028,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1927] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>","[L1928] 242 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1929] For Practice Try Exercise 67\r\n[L1930] the levels of these factors form the four treatments shown in Figure 4.6. One\ufffefourth of the subjects were assigned at random to each of these treatments.\r\n[L1931] On odd-numbered days, the subjects took either a tablet that contained as\ufffepirin or a dummy pill that looked and tasted like the aspirin but had no \r\n[L1932] active ingredient (a placebo). On even-numbered days, they took either a \r\n[L1933] capsule containing beta-carotene or a placebo. There were several response \r\n[L1934] variables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\n[L1935] other medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\n[L1936] only 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\n[L1937] large enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\n[L1938] attacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\n[L1939] preventing cancer.\r\n[L1940] PROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\n[L1941] design was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\n[L1942] SOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\n[L1943] lurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\n[L1944] treatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\n[L1945] schedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\n[L1946] which subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\n[L1947] helped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\n[L1948] begin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\n[L1949] replication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\n[L1950] the groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\n[L1951] the random assignment.\r\n[L1952] The control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n[L1953] (placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\n[L1954] Experiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L1955] The logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\n[L1956] all the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\n[L1957] that all subjects really are treated identically.\r\n[L1958] If some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\n[L1959] group takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\n[L1960] the subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\n[L1961] experiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\n[L1962] On even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo. Many patients respond favorably to any treatment, even a placebo, perhaps \r\n[L1963] because they trust the doctor. The response to a dummy treatment is called the \r\n[L1964] Placebo\r\n[L1965] Factor 1:\r\n[L1966] Aspirin\r\n[L1967] Factor 2: Beta-carotene\r\n[L1968] Yes\r\n[L1969] Yes No\r\n[L1970] Aspirin Beta-carotene Aspirin Placebo\r\n[L1971] No\r\n[L1972] Placebo Beta-carotene Placebo Placebo\r\n[L1973] FIGURE 4.6 The treatments in the \r\n[L1974] Physicians\u2019 Health Study.","[L1975] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b06f1b5c1816f6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_37.jpg","size_bytes":61000,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1976] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>","[L1977] Section 4.2 Experiments 243\r\n[L1978] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1979] placebo effect. If some subjects did not take any pills, the effect of aspirin or \r\n[L1980] beta-carotene would be confounded with the placebo effect, the effect of simply \r\n[L1981] taking pills.\r\n[L1982] Curing Baldness and Soothing Pain\r\n[L1983] Do placebos work?\r\n[L1984] Want to help balding men keep their hair? Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\n[L1985] that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\n[L1986] heads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n[L1987] 24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\n[L1988] active medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\n[L1989] the pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\n[L1990] significantly less pain.24\r\n[L1991] When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\n[L1992] that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\n[L1993] placebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\n[L1994] treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\n[L1995] enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\n[L1996] place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\n[L1997] The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\n[L1998] their hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\n[L1999] beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\n[L2000] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L2001] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L2002] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L2003] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L2004] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L2005] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L2006] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L2007] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L2008] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L2009] Placebo effect","[L2010] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2011] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>","[L2012] 244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2013] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L2014] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L2015] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L2016] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L2017] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L2018] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L2019] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L2020] the response variable do know.\r\n[L2021] Single-blind\r\n[L2022] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L2023] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L2024] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L2025] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L2026] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L2027] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L2028] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L2029] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\n[L2030] received the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n[L2031] 1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n[L2032] 2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n[L2033] 3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L2034] experiment.\r\n[L2035] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L2036] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L2037] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L2038] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L2039] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L2040] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L2041] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L2042] significant.\r\n[L2043] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L2044] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L2045] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L2046] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L2047] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation.

David Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah \r\n[L2055] designed an experiment to help answer this question. They used 48 un\ufffedergraduate students as subjects. The researchers randomly assigned half \r\n[L2056] of the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\n[L2057] the other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger. One \r\n[L2058] response variable was whether the driver stopped at a rest area that was \r\n[L2059] specified by researchers before the simulation started.

Since \r\n[L2070] we\u2019re assuming that the treatment received won\u2019t change whether each driver \r\n[L2071] stops at the rest area, we use 33 cards to represent drivers who stop and 15 cards \r\n[L2072] to represent those who don\u2019t.

Let\u2019s return \r\n[L2104] to the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\n[L2105] one group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L2106] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L2107] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L2108] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L2109] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L2110] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L2111] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L2112] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L2113] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L2114] response to the treatments.\r\n[L2115] Blocking\r\n[L2116] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L2117] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L2118] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L2119] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L2120] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

The response variable is a cleanli\ufffeness rating on a scale of 0 (very dirty) to 10 (very clean). How \r\n[L2132] should researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water? They could \r\n[L2133] use a completely randomized design and hope that the \r\n[L2134] random assignment distributes the light-colored clothing \r\n[L2135] about evenly between the cold- and warm-water treatment \r\n[L2136] groups.

They control the effects of some outside \r\n[L2181] variables by bringing those variables into the experiment to form the blocks. \r\n[L2182] A randomized block design allows us to draw separate conclusions about each \r\n[L2183] block, for example, about light-colored and dark-colored clothes in the laundry \r\n[L2184] experiment.

A wise experimenter will form blocks based on the most important un\ufffeavoidable sources of variability (lurking variables) among the experimental units. \r\n[L2193] Randomization will then average out the effects of the remaining lurking vari\ufffeables and allow an unbiased comparison of the treatments.

This ignores the differences between men and women, which would probably result in a great \r\n[L2220] deal of variability in responses to the advertising in all three groups.

The idea is to create blocks by matching pairs of similar \r\n[L2262] experimental units. Then we can use chance to decide which member of a pair \r\n[L2263] gets the first treatment. The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L2264] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L2265] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L2266] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L2267] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L2268] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L2269] Matched pairs design\r\n[L2270] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L2271] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L2272] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L2273] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L2274] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L2275] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L2276] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L2277] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L2278] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L2279] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L2280] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L2281] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L2282] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L2283] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L2284] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L2285] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates?

Completely randomized design For the first experiment, you\u2019ll randomly \r\n[L2288] assign half of the students in your class to stand and the other half to sit.

Since you already sat or stood in Step 1, \r\n[L2295] you just need to do the opposite now. As before, everyone should measure their \r\n[L2296] pulses for one minute after completing the treatment (that is, once they are \r\n[L2297] standing or sitting).

Make a dotplot of these differences and cal\ufffeculate their mean. Is there evidence that standing pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2308] 5. What advantage does the matched pairs design have over the completely \r\n[L2309] randomized design?\r\n[L2310] An AP Statistics class with 24 students performed the \u201cGet Your Heart Beating\u201d \r\n[L2311] Activity. We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\n[L2312] EXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\n[L2313] Design determines analysis\r\n[L2314] A Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\n[L2315] randomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\n[L2316] standing group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n[L2317] 68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\n[L2318] higher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\n[L2319] pulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\n[L2320] graph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\n[L2321] standing pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\n[L2322] What about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\n[L2323] Fathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\n[L2324] rates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\n[L2325] difference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n[L2326] 24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\n[L2327] standing pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\n[L2328] evidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\n[L2329] Let\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\n[L2330] that we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\n[L2331] experimental designs. Blocking by subject in the matched pairs design greatly \r\n[L2332] reduced the variability in the response variable. That made it easier to detect \r\n[L2333] the fact that standing causes an increase in pulse rate. With the large amount \r\n[L2334] of variability in the completely randomized design, we were unable to draw \r\n[L2335] such a conclusion.","[L2336] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5c9678406de9a79#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_45.jpg","size_bytes":52515,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2337] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 47 / 75>","[L2338] Section 4.2 Experiments 251\r\n[L2339] Another important lesson to take away from the example is this: the design of the \r\n[L2340] study determines the appropriate method of analysis. For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\n[L2341] dotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\n[L2342] compare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\n[L2343] The following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\n[L2344] analyzing data from an experiment.\r\n[L2345] DATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\n[L2346] Most automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n[L2347] 78% nitrogen.

Could filling automobile tires with nitrogen improve safety, perfor\ufffemance, or both?\r\n[L2349] Consumers Union designed a study to test whether nitrogen-filled tires would \r\n[L2350] maintain pressure better than air-filled tires.

Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\n[L2384] be distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\n[L2385] experiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\n[L2386] actually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\n[L2387] variable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\n[L2388] s In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\n[L2389] is a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\n[L2390] s The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\n[L2391] manner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\n[L2392] principles of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\n[L2393] assignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\n[L2394] s The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\n[L2395] two or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\n[L2396] with other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\n[L2397] s Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\n[L2398] Random assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\n[L2399] chance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\n[L2400] comparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\n[L2401] s Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\n[L2402] reduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\n[L2403] likely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\n[L2404] s Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\n[L2405] neither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\n[L2406] responses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\n[L2407] the other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\n[L2408] s Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\n[L2409] That helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\n[L2410] patients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\n[L2411] they have received an inactive treatment.\r\n[L2412] s In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\n[L2413] individuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\n[L2414] Randomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\n[L2415] helps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\n[L2416] s Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\n[L2417] treatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\n[L2418] treatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\n[L2419] closely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\n[L2420] Summary SECTION 4.2","[L2421] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","[L2423] Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n[L2424] 45.

Researchers began by \r\n[L2428] asking 305 healthy pregnant women to report their \r\n[L2429] chocolate consumption. Six months after birth, the \r\n[L2430] researchers asked mothers to rate their infants\u2019 tem\ufffeperament, including smiling, laughter, and fear.

Learning biology with computers An educator wants \r\n[L2452] to compare the effectiveness of computer software for \r\n[L2453] teaching biology with that of a textbook presentation. \r\n[L2454] She gives a biology pretest to each of a group of high \r\n[L2455] school juniors, then randomly divides them into \r\n[L2456] two groups. One group uses the computer, and the \r\n[L2457] other studies the text.

Cell phones and brain cancer One study of cell \r\n[L2467] phones and the risk of brain cancer looked at a group \r\n[L2468] of 469 people who have brain cancer. The investiga\ufffetors matched each cancer patient with a person of \r\n[L2469] the same age, gender, and race who did not have \r\n[L2470] brain cancer, then asked about the use of cell phones. \r\n[L2471] Result: \u201cOur data suggest that the use of handheld \r\n[L2472] cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain \r\n[L2473] cancer.\u201d32\r\n[L2474] (a) Is this an observational study or an experiment? \r\n[L2475] Justify your answer.\r\n[L2476] (b) Based on this study, would you conclude that cell \r\n[L2477] phones do not increase the risk of brain cancer?

Effects of class size Do smaller classes in elementary \r\n[L2480] school really benefit students in areas such as scores \r\n[L2481] on standardized tests, staying in school, and going on \r\n[L2482] to college? We might do an observational study that \r\n[L2483] compares students who happened to be in smaller \r\n[L2484] and larger classes in their early school years. Identify \r\n[L2485] a lurking variable that may lead to confounding with \r\n[L2486] the effects of small classes. Explain how confounding \r\n[L2487] might occur.\r\n[L2488] 50. Effects of binge drinking A common definition of \r\n[L2489] \u201cbinge drinking\u201d is 5 or more drinks at one sitting for \r\n[L2490] men and 4 or more for women. An observational study \r\n[L2491] finds that students who binge drink have lower average \r\n[L2492] GPA than those who don\u2019t. Identify a lurking variable \r\n[L2493] that may be confounded with the effects of binge \r\n[L2494] drinking.

Growing in the shade Ability to grow in shade may \r\n[L2499] help pines found in the dry forests of Arizona to resist \r\n[L2500] drought. How well do these pines grow in shade? \r\n[L2501] Investigators planted pine seedlings in a greenhouse \r\n[L2502] in either full light, light reduced to 25% of normal \r\n[L2503] by shade cloth, or light reduced to 5% of normal.

Some students \r\n[L2517] will pay a low flat rate. Others will pay higher rates at \r\n[L2518] peak periods and very low rates off-peak. The univer\ufffesity is interested in the amount and time of use and in \r\n[L2519] the effect on the congestion of the network.\r\n[L2520] 53. Improving response rate How can we reduce the \r\n[L2521] rate of refusals in telephone surveys? Most people \r\n[L2522] who answer at all listen to the interviewer\u2019s introduc\ufffetory remarks and then decide whether to continue. \r\n[L2523] One study made telephone calls to randomly selected \r\n[L2524] households to ask opinions about the next election. In \r\n[L2525] some calls, the interviewer gave her name, in others \r\n[L2526] she identified the university she was representing, \r\n[L2527] and in still others she identified both herself and the \r\n[L2528] university. For each type of call, the interviewer either \r\n[L2529] did or did not offer to send a copy of the final survey \r\n[L2530] results to the person interviewed. Do these differences \r\n[L2531] in the introduction affect whether the interview is \r\n[L2532] completed?\r\n[L2533] 54. Eat well and exercise Most American adolescents \r\n[L2534] don\u2019t eat well and don\u2019t exercise enough. Can middle \r\n[L2535] schools increase physical activity among \r\n[L2536] their students? Can they persuade students to eat \r\n[L2537] better? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\n[L2538] intervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\n[L2539] school day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\n[L2540] for healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\n[L2541] school was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention. The \r\n[L2542] investigators observed physical activity and lunchtime \r\n[L2543] consumption of fat.\r\n[L2544] 55. Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\n[L2545] will use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\n[L2546] raise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\n[L2547] either 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n[L2548] 150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\n[L2549] combinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\n[L2550] fabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\n[L2551] for quality.\r\n[L2552] 56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\n[L2553] the increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\n[L2554] they stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\n[L2555] beat of a metronome. The step was either 5.75 or 11.5 \r\n[L2556] inches high and the metronome beat was 14, 21, or \r\n[L2557] 28 steps per minute. Five students stepped at each \r\n[L2558] combination of height and speed.\r\n[L2559] 57. Cocoa and blood flow A study conducted by Nor\ufffeman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham \r\n[L2560] and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, \r\n[L2561] involved 27 healthy people aged 18 to 72. Each \r\n[L2562] subject consumed a cocoa beverage containing 900 \r\n[L2563] milligrams of flavonols (a class of flavonoids) daily \r\n[L2564] for five days. Using a finger cuff, blood flow was mea\ufffesured on the first and fifth days of the study. After five \r\n[L2565] days, researchers measured what they called \u201csignifi\ufffecant improvement\u201d in blood flow and the function of \r\n[L2566] the cells that line the blood vessels.33 What flaw in the \r\n[L2567] design of this experiment makes it impossible to say \r\n[L2568] whether the cocoa really caused the improved blood \r\n[L2569] flow? Explain.\r\n[L2570] 58. Reducing unemployment Will cash bonuses speed \r\n[L2571] the return to work of unemployed people? A state \r\n[L2572] department of labor notes that last year 68% of people \r\n[L2573] who filed claims for unemployment insurance found \r\n[L2574] a new job within 15 weeks. As an experiment, this year \r\n[L2575] the state offers $500 to people filing unemployment \r\n[L2576] claims if they find a job within 15 weeks. The percent \r\n[L2577] who do so increases to 77%. What flaw in the design \r\n[L2578] of this experiment makes it impossible to say whether \r\n[L2579] the bonus really caused the increase? Explain.\r\n[L2580] 59. Layoffs and \u201csurvivor guilt\u201d Workers who survive a \r\n[L2581] layoff of other employees at their location may suffer \r\n[L2582] from \u201csurvivor guilt.\u201d A study of survivor guilt and \r\n[L2583] its effects used as subjects 120 students who were \r\n[L2584] offered an opportunity to earn extra course credit by \r\n[L2585] doing proofreading. Each subject worked in the same \r\n[L2586] cubicle as another student, who was an accomplice \r\n[L2587] of the experimenters. At a break midway through the \r\n[L2588] work, one of three things happened:\r\n[L2589] Treatment 1: The accomplice was told to leave; it was \r\n[L2590] explained that this was because she performed poorly.\r\n[L2591] Treatment 2: It was explained that unforeseen circum\ufffestances meant there was only enough work for one \r\n[L2592] person. By \u201cchance,\u201d the accomplice was chosen to \r\n[L2593] be laid off.\r\n[L2594] Treatment 3: Both students continued to work after \r\n[L2595] the break.\r\n[L2596] The subjects\u2019 work performance after the break \r\n[L2597] was compared with performance before the break.34\r\n[L2598] Describe how you would randomly assign the \r\n[L2599] subjects to the treatments\r\n[L2600] (a) using slips of paper.\r\n[L2601] (b) using Table D.\r\n[L2602] (c) using technology.\r\n[L2603] 60.

Headache relief Doctors identify \u201cchronic tension\ufffetype headaches\u201d as headaches that occur almost \r\n[L2615] daily for at least six months. Can antidepressant \r\n[L2616] medications or stress management training reduce \r\n[L2617] the number and severity of these headaches? Are both \r\n[L2618] together more effective than either alone? Investiga\ufffetors compared four treatments: antidepressant alone, \r\n[L2619] placebo alone, antidepressant plus stress manage\ufffement, and placebo plus stress management.

The changing climate will \r\n[L2634] probably bring more rain to California, but we don\u2019t \r\n[L2635] know whether the additional rain will come during the \r\n[L2636] winter wet season or extend into the long dry season in \r\n[L2637] spring and summer. Kenwyn Suttle of the University \r\n[L2638] of California at Berkeley and his coworkers carried \r\n[L2639] out an experiment to study the effects of more rain in \r\n[L2640] either season. They randomly assigned plots of open \r\n[L2641] grassland to 3 treatments: added water equal to 20% of \r\n[L2642] annual rainfall either during January to March (winter) \r\n[L2643] or during April to June (spring), and no added water \r\n[L2644] (control).

Treating prostate disease A large study used records \r\n[L2654] from Canada\u2019s national health care system to com\ufffepare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate \r\n[L2655] disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery \r\n[L2656] and a new method that does not require surgery. The \r\n[L2657] records described many patients whose doctors had \r\n[L2658] chosen each method.

All the infants received \r\n[L2716] nutritional supplements and help from social workers. \r\n[L2717] Half were also assigned at random to an intensive \r\n[L2718] preschool program.38\r\n[L2719] (a) Explain the purpose of each of the three experi\ufffemental design principles.\r\n[L2720] (b) Describe how each of these principles was used \r\n[L2721] in this study.\r\n[L2722] 68. Killing weeds A biologist would like to determine \r\n[L2723] which of two brands of weed killer is less likely to \r\n[L2724] harm the plants in a garden at the university. Before \r\n[L2725] spraying near the plants, the biologist decides to \r\n[L2726] conduct an experiment using 24 individual plants. \r\n[L2727] Which of the following two plans for randomly \r\n[L2728] assigning the treatments should the biologist use? \r\n[L2729] Why?\r\n[L2730] Plan A: Choose the 12 healthiest-looking plants. \r\n[L2731] Apply Brand X weed killer to all 12 of those plants. \r\n[L2732] Apply Brand Y weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2733] Plan B: Choose 12 of the 24 plants at random. Apply \r\n[L2734] Brand X weed killer to those 12 plants and Brand Y \r\n[L2735] weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2736] 69. Do placebos really work? Researchers in Japan \r\n[L2737] conducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\n[L2738] were extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\n[L2739] each subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\n[L2740] told the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\n[L2741] subject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\n[L2742] was poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\n[L2743] the arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n[L2744] 13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\n[L2745] poison ivy leaf.39\r\n[L2746] (a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n[L2747] (b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\n[L2748] idea of a placebo effect.\r\n[L2749] 70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\n[L2750] chronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\n[L2751] and needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\n[L2752] will be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\n[L2753] percent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n[L2754] (a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\n[L2755] drug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n[L2756] (b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\n[L2757] getting the new drug or a placebo? How would this \r\n[L2758] knowledge probably affect their reactions?\r\n[L2759] 71. Meditation for anxiety An experiment that claimed \r\n[L2760] to show that meditation lowers anxiety proceeded as \r\n[L2761] follows. The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\n[L2762] and rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\n[L2763] were randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\n[L2764] meditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\n[L2765] simply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\n[L2766] the experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\n[L2767] and rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\n[L2768] now had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\n[L2769] Explain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\n[L2770] could bias the reported results.\r\n[L2771] 72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\n[L2772] testosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\n[L2773] cause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\n[L2774] fat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\n[L2775] supplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\n[L2776] in the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\n[L2777] with low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\n[L2778] a testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\n[L2779] in the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\n[L2780] described the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\n[L2781] placebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\n[L2782] terms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n[L2783] 73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\n[L2784] determine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\n[L2785] acupuncture could help infertile women become \r\n[L2786] pregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\n[L2787] undergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\n[L2788] were recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\n[L2789] randomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n[L2790] 25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\n[L2791] minutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\n[L2792] were instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\n[L2793] embryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n[L2794] 34 women became pregnant. In the control group, \r\n[L2795] 21 women became pregnant.\r\n[L2796] (a) Describe how the three principles of experimen\ufffetal design were addressed in this study.\r\n[L2797] (b) The difference in the percent of women who \r\n[L2798] became pregnant in the two groups is statistically \r\n[L2799] significant. Explain what this means to someone who \r\n[L2800] knows little statistics.\r\n[L2801] (c) Explain why the placebo effect prevents us from \r\n[L2802] concluding that acupuncture caused the difference in \r\n[L2803] pregnancy rates.\r\n[L2804] pg 241","[L2805] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>","[L2806] Section 4.2 Experiments 257\r\n[L2807] 74. Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\n[L2808] colleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\n[L2809] Half of the participants were randomly assigned \r\n[L2810] to a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\n[L2811] assigned to a low-fat diet. Researchers measured each \r\n[L2812] participant\u2019s change in weight and cholesterol level \r\n[L2813] after six months and again after one year. Subjects in \r\n[L2814] the low-carb diet group lost significantly more weight \r\n[L2815] than subjects in the low-fat diet group during the first \r\n[L2816] six months of the study. At the end of a year, however, \r\n[L2817] the average weight loss for subjects in the two groups \r\n[L2818] was not significantly different.42\r\n[L2819] (a) Why did researchers randomly assign the subjects \r\n[L2820] to the diet treatments?\r\n[L2821] (b) Explain to someone who knows little statistics \r\n[L2822] what \u201clost significantly more weight\u201d means.\r\n[L2823] (c) The subjects in the low-carb diet group lost an aver\ufffeage of 5.1 kg in a year. The subjects in the low-fat diet \r\n[L2824] group lost an average of 3.1 kg. Explain how this infor\ufffemation could be consistent with the fact that weight loss \r\n[L2825] in the two groups was not significantly different.\r\n[L2826] 75. Is yawning contagious? According to the popular \r\n[L2827] TV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\n[L2828] March 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\n[L2829] presented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\n[L2830] subjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\n[L2831] an extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\n[L2832] camera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\n[L2833] seed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\n[L2834] yawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\n[L2835] who had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\n[L2836] given a yawn seed, 10 yawned. Adam Savage and Ja\ufffemie Hyneman, the cohosts of Mythbusters, used these \r\n[L2837] results to conclude that yawning is contagious.\r\n[L2838] (a) Explain how you could use slips of paper to ran\ufffedomly reassign the subjects to the treatment groups.\r\n[L2839] (b) Suppose we used your method in (a) to redo the \r\n[L2840] random assignment 50 times.

The researchers decided to \r\n[L2846] analyze the patients\u2019 final pain ratings. It also makes \r\n[L2847] sense to examine the difference between patients\u2019 \r\n[L2848] initial pain ratings and their final pain ratings in both \r\n[L2849] groups. Here are the data:\r\n[L2850] Active: 10, 6, 1, 10, 6, 8, 5, 5, 6, 8, 7, 8, 7, 6, 4, 4, 7, 10, 6, 10, 6, 5, 5, 1, \r\n[L2851] 0, 0, 0, 0, 1\r\n[L2852] Inactive: 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1\r\n[L2853] (a) Construct a comparative dotplot of the data. \r\n[L2854] Describe what you see.\r\n[L2855] (b) Calculate the mean (average) change in pain \r\n[L2856] rating for each group.

Doctors and nurses Nurse-practitioners are nurses \r\n[L2864] with advanced qualifications who often act much like \r\n[L2865] primary-care physicians. Are they as effective as \r\n[L2866] doctors at treating patients with chronic conditions? \r\n[L2867] An experiment was conducted with 1316 patients \r\n[L2868] who had been diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, or \r\n[L2869] high blood pressure. Within each condition, patients \r\n[L2870] were randomly assigned to either a doctor or a \r\n[L2871] nurse-practitioner. The response variables included \r\n[L2872] measures of the patients\u2019 health and of their \r\n[L2873] satisfaction with their medical care after 6 months.43\r\n[L2874] (a) Which are the blocks in this experiment: the \r\n[L2875] different diagnoses (asthma, etc.) or the type of care \r\n[L2876] (nurse or doctor)?

Comparing cancer treatments The progress of a \r\n[L2881] type of cancer differs in women and men. Researchers \r\n[L2882] want to design an experiment to compare three thera\ufffepies for this cancer.

In the cornfield An agriculture researcher wants to \r\n[L2895] compare the yield of 5 corn varieties: A, B, C, D, and \r\n[L2896] E. The field in which the experiment will be carried \r\n[L2897] out increases in fertility from north to south. The \r\n[L2898] researcher therefore divides the field into 25 plots \r\n[L2899] of equal size, arranged in 5 east\u2013west rows of 5 plots \r\n[L2900] each, as shown in the diagram.\r\n[L2901] North\r\n[L2902] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2903] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2904] setting.\r\n[L2905] (b) Should the researcher use the rows or the \r\n[L2906] columns of the field as blocks?

Comparing weight-loss treatments Twenty over\ufffeweight females have agreed to participate in a study \r\n[L2911] of the effectiveness of four weight-loss treatments: \r\n[L2912] A, B, C, and D. The researcher first calculates how \r\n[L2913] overweight each subject is by comparing the subject\u2019s \r\n[L2914] actual weight with her \u201cideal\u201d weight. The subjects \r\n[L2915] and their excess weights in pounds are as follows:\r\n[L2916] Birnbaum 35 Hernandez 25 Moses 25 Smith 29\r\n[L2917] Brown 34 Jackson 33 Nevesky 39 Stall 33\r\n[L2918] Brunk 30 Kendall 28 Obrach 30 Tran 35\r\n[L2919] Cruz 34 Loren 32 Rodriguez 30 Wilansky 42\r\n[L2920] Deng 24 Mann 28 Santiago 27 Williams 22\r\n[L2921] The response variable is the weight lost after 8 weeks of \r\n[L2922] treatment. Previous studies have shown that the effects \r\n[L2923] of a diet may vary based on a subject\u2019s initial weight.\r\n[L2924] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2925] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2926] setting.\r\n[L2927] (b) Should researchers form blocks of size 4 based on \r\n[L2928] subjects\u2019 last names in alphabetical order or by how \r\n[L2929] overweight the subjects are? Explain.\r\n[L2930] (c) Use technology or Table D to carry out the \r\n[L2931] random assignment required by your design. Explain \r\n[L2932] your method clearly.\r\n[L2933] 81. Aw, rats! A nutrition experimenter intends to \r\n[L2934] compare the weight gain of newly weaned male \r\n[L2935] rats fed Diet A with that of rats fed Diet B. To do this, \r\n[L2936] she will feed each diet to 10 rats. She has available \r\n[L2937] 10 rats from one litter and 10 rats from a second \r\n[L2938] litter. Rats in the first litter appear to be slightly \r\n[L2939] healthier.\r\n[L2940] (a) If the 10 rats from Litter 1 were fed Diet A, the \r\n[L2941] effects of genetics and diet would be confounded, and \r\n[L2942] the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A. \r\n[L2943] Explain this statement carefully.\r\n[L2944] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2945] 82. Technology for teaching statistics The Brigham \r\n[L2946] Young University (BYU) statistics department is \r\n[L2947] performing experiments to compare teaching meth\ufffeods. Response variables include students\u2019 final-exam \r\n[L2948] scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. \r\n[L2949] One study compares two levels of technology for large \r\n[L2950] lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) \r\n[L2951] and multimedia. There are 8 lecture sections of a \r\n[L2952] basic statistics course at BYU, each with about 200 \r\n[L2953] students. There are four instructors, each of whom \r\n[L2954] teaches two sections.44 Suppose the sections and \r\n[L2955] lecturers are as follows:\r\n[L2956] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2957] 1 Hilton\r\n[L2958] 2 Christensen\r\n[L2959] 3 Hadfield\r\n[L2960] 4 Hadfield\r\n[L2961] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2962] 5 Tolley\r\n[L2963] 6 Hilton\r\n[L2964] 7 Tolley\r\n[L2965] 8 Christensen\r\n[L2966] (a) Suppose we randomly assign two lecturers to use \r\n[L2967] standard technology in their sections and the other \r\n[L2968] two lecturers to use multimedia technology.

Chocolate gets my heart pumping Cardiologists \r\n[L3000] at Athens Medical School in Greece wanted to test \r\n[L3001] whether chocolate affected blood flow in the blood \r\n[L3002] vessels. The researchers recruited 17 healthy young \r\n[L3003] volunteers, who were each given a 3.5-ounce bar of \r\n[L3004] dark chocolate, either bittersweet or fake chocolate. \r\n[L3005] On another day, the volunteers were switched. The \r\n[L3006] subjects had no chocolate outside the study, and \r\n[L3007] investigators didn\u2019t know whether a subject had eaten \r\n[L3008] the real or the fake chocolate. An ultrasound was \r\n[L3009] taken of each volunteer\u2019s upper arm to see the func\ufffetioning of the cells in the walls of the main artery. \r\n[L3010] The investigators found that blood vessel function was \r\n[L3011] improved when the subjects ate bittersweet chocolate, \r\n[L3012] and that there were no such changes when they ate \r\n[L3013] the placebo (fake chocolate).45\r\n[L3014] (a) What type of design did the investigators use in \r\n[L3015] their study?\r\n[L3016] (b) Explain why the investigators chose this design \r\n[L3017] instead of a completely randomized design.\r\n[L3018] (c) Why is it important to randomly assign the order \r\n[L3019] of the treatments for the subjects?\r\n[L3020] 85. Room temperature and dexterity An expert on \r\n[L3021] worker performance is interested in the effect of \r\n[L3022] room temperature on the performance of tasks \r\n[L3023] requiring manual dexterity. She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\n[L3024] variable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\n[L3025] a 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\n[L3026] requires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\n[L3027] subject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\n[L3028] make as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\n[L3029] continuous effort.\r\n[L3030] (a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\n[L3031] compare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\n[L3032] available.\r\n[L3033] (b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\n[L3034] wide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\n[L3035] subjects in each group. Describe in detail the design \r\n[L3036] of a matched pairs experiment in which each subject \r\n[L3037] serves as his or her own control.\r\n[L3038] 86. Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\n[L3039] of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\n[L3040] increasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\n[L3041] Because plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\n[L3042] CO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\n[L3043] An elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\n[L3044] CO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\n[L3045] the growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\n[L3046] untreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\n[L3047] growth. We can afford to treat three circular areas.46\r\n[L3048] (a) Describe the design of a completely randomized \r\n[L3049] experiment using 6 well-separated 30-meter circular \r\n[L3050] areas in a pine forest. Sketch the circles and carry out \r\n[L3051] the randomization your design calls for.\r\n[L3052] (b) Areas within the forest may differ in soil fertility. \r\n[L3053] Describe a matched pairs design using three pairs \r\n[L3054] of circles that will reduce the extra variation due to \r\n[L3055] different fertility. Sketch the circles and carry out the \r\n[L3056] randomization your design calls for.\r\n[L3057] 87. Got deodorant? A group of students wants to per\ufffeform an experiment to determine whether Brand A or \r\n[L3058] Brand B deodorant lasts longer. One group member \r\n[L3059] suggests the following design: Recruit 40 student \r\n[L3060] volunteers\u201420 male and 20 female.

Can changing diet reduce high blood pressure? \r\n[L3098] Vegetarian diets and low-salt diets are both promising. \r\n[L3099] Men with high blood pressure are assigned at random \r\n[L3100] to four diets: (1) normal diet with unrestricted salt; \r\n[L3101] (2) vegetarian with unrestricted salt; (3) normal with \r\n[L3102] restricted salt; and (4) vegetarian with restricted salt. \r\n[L3103] This experiment has\r\n[L3104] (a) one factor, the type of diet.\r\n[L3105] (b) two factors, high blood pressure and type of diet.\r\n[L3106] (c) two factors, normal/vegetarian diet and unre\ufffestricted/restricted salt.\r\n[L3107] (d) three factors, men, high blood pressure, and type \r\n[L3108] of diet.\r\n[L3109] (e) four factors, the four diets being compared.\r\n[L3110] 92.

Is this \r\n[L3152] good evidence that ibuprofen is effective in prevent\ufffeing Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\r\n[L3153] (a) Yes, because the study was a randomized, \r\n[L3154] comparative experiment.\r\n[L3155] (b) No, because the effect of ibuprofen is confounded \r\n[L3156] with the placebo effect.\r\n[L3157] (c) Yes, because the results were published in a \r\n[L3158] reputable professional journal.\r\n[L3159] (d) No, because this is an observational study.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L3219] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L3220] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L3221] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L3222] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L3223] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L3224] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3225] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L3226] on the design of the study.\r\n[L3227] Scope of Inference\r\n[L3228] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L3229] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L3230] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L3231] results of the sample.\r\n[L3232] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L3233] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L3234] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L3235] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L3236] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L3237] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L3238] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L3239] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L3240] 4.3\r\n[L3241] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","[L3242] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3243] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","[L3244] 262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3245] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L3246] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L3247] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L3248] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L3249] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L3250] Yes No\r\n[L3251] Were individuals \r\n[L3252] randomly selected?\r\n[L3253] Yes\r\n[L3254] Inference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\n[L3255] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3256] No Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\n[L3257] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3258] Well-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\n[L3259] However, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\n[L3260] larger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\n[L3261] effect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\n[L3262] rules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\n[L3263] random sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\n[L3264] example illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\n[L3265] EXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\n[L3266] Determining scope of inference\r\n[L3267] A small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\n[L3268] The dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\n[L3269] Design 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3270] to take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L3271] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L3272] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L3273] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L3274] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3275] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L3276] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3277] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3278] part in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3279] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3280] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L3281] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3282] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L3283] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L3284] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L3285] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L3286] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L3287] SOLUTION:\r\n[L3288] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L3289] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments ","[L3290] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a9a2c4c5c24a51b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_57.jpg","size_bytes":59616,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3291] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>","[L3292] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L3293] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3294] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L3295] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L3296] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L3297] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L3298] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L3299] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L3300] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L3301] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L3302] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L3303] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L3304] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L3305] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L3306] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L3307] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L3308] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L3309] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L3310] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L3311] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L3312] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L3313] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L3314] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L3315] the town.\r\n[L3316] The Challenges of \r\n[L3317] Establishing Causation\r\n[L3318] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L3319] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L3320] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L3321] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L3322] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L3323] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L3324] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\n[L3325] Lack of realism\r\n[L3326] Do those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3327] since 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\n[L3328] showed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\n[L3329] But requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\n[L3330] What happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\n[L3331] all cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\n[L3332] For Practice Try Exercise 105","[L3333] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3334] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","[L3335] 264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3336] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3337] In some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\n[L3338] these important questions:\r\n[L3339] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L3340] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L3341] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L3342] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L3343] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L3344] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L3345] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L3346] studies.\r\n[L3347] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L3348] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L3349] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L3350] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L3351] Living with observational studies\r\n[L3352] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L3353] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L3354] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L3355] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L3356] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L3357] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L3358] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L3359] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L3360] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L3361] experiment?\r\n[L3362] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L3363] very strong.\r\n[L3364] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L3365] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L3366] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L3367] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L3368] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L3369] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L3370] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L3371] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L3372] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L3373] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L3374] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L3375] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L3376] cancer death among women.","[L3377] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3378] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","[L3379] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L3380] sThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\n[L3381] cigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\n[L3382] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L3383] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3384] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L3385] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L3386] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L3387] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\n[L3388] observational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\n[L3389] Data Ethics*\r\n[L3390] Medical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\n[L3391] Shouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\n[L3392] reasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L3393] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L3394] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L3395] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L3396] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L3397] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L3398] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L3399] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L3400] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L3401] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L3402] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L3403] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\n[L3404] knows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\n[L3405] the physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\n[L3406] sWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L3407] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L3408] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L3409] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L3410] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L3411] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\n[L3412] are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\n[L3413] data from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\n[L3414] Basic Data Ethics\r\n[L3415] All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\n[L3416] board charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\n[L3417] All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\n[L3418] before data are collected.\r\n[L3419] All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\n[L3420] groups of subjects may be made public.\r\n[L3421] *This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","[L3422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","[L3423] 266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3424] The law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\n[L3425] obey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\n[L3426] Institutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\n[L3427] to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\n[L3428] it is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\n[L3429] board, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\n[L3430] recruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\n[L3431] study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\n[L3432] are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\n[L3433] research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\n[L3434] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L3435] boards.\r\n[L3436] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L3437] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L3438] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L3439] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L3440] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L3441] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L3442] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L3443] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L3444] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L3445] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L3446] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L3447] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L3448] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L3449] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L3450] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity. Anonym\ufffeity means that individuals are anonymous\u2014their names ","[L3451] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 63 / 75>","[L3452] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 267\r\n[L3453] are not known even to the director of the study. Anonymity is rare in statistical stud\ufffeies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it \r\n[L3454] prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform individuals of results.\r\n[L3455] Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L3456] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L3457] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L3458] other identification have been removed from the data available for search. Privacy \r\n[L3459] and confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the computer age.\r\n[L3460] ACTIVITY Response bias\r\n[L3461] In this Activity, your team will design and conduct an experiment to investigate \r\n[L3462] the effects of response bias in surveys.53 You may choose the topic for your sur\ufffeveys, but you must design your experiment so that it can answer at least one of the \r\n[L3463] following questions:\r\n[L3464] sCan the wording of a question create response bias?\r\n[L3465] sDo the characteristics of the interviewer create response bias?\r\n[L3466] sDoes anonymity change the responses to sensitive questions?\r\n[L3467] sDoes manipulating the answer choices change the response?\r\n[L3468] 1. Write a proposal describing the design of your experiment. Be sure to \r\n[L3469] include\r\n[L3470] (a) your chosen topic and which of the above questions you\u2019ll try to answer.\r\n[L3471] (b) a detailed description of how you will obtain your subjects (minimum of \r\n[L3472] 50). Your plan must be practical!\r\n[L3473] (c) what your questions will be and how they will be asked.\r\n[L3474] (d) a clear explanation of how you will implement your design.\r\n[L3475] (e) precautions you will take to collect data ethically.\r\n[L3476] Here are two examples of successful student projects:\r\n[L3477] \u201cMake-Up,\u201d by Caryn S. and Trisha T.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L3496] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L3497] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L3498] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L3499] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L3500] results.\r\n[L3501] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L3502] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L3503] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L3504] lurking variables.\r\n[L3505] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L3506] review board. All participants must give their informed consent before \r\n[L3507] taking part. Any information about the individuals in the study must be \r\n[L3508] kept confidential.\r\n[L3509] s Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions \r\n[L3510] that can\u2019t be answered without them. Also remember that \u201cthe interests of \r\n[L3511] the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\u201d54\r\n[L3512] Summary SECTION 4.3\r\n[L3513] Magnets and Pain\r\n[L3514] Let\u2019s return to the chapter-opening Case Study (page 205). Researchers carried \r\n[L3515] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L3516] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\n[L3517] dotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\n[L3518] magnet).\r\n[L3519] The average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\n[L3520] and 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\n[L3521] significant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\n[L3522] The difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\n[L3523] too large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain. But since the subjects were volunteers, we can\u2019t \r\n[L3524] safely generalize the findings of this experiment to any larger \r\n[L3525] population.\r\n[L3526] case closed","[L3527] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 65 / 75>","[L3528] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 269\r\n[L3529] 102.

Foster care versus orphanages Do abandoned \r\n[L3534] children placed in foster homes do better than \r\n[L3535] similar children placed in an institution? The \r\n[L3536] Bucharest Early Intervention Project found that \r\n[L3537] the answer is a clear \u201cYes.\u201d The subjects were 136 \r\n[L3538] young children abandoned at birth and living in \r\n[L3539] orphanages in Bucharest, Romania. Half of the \r\n[L3540] children, chosen at random, were placed in foster \r\n[L3541] homes. The other half remained in the orphanages.55\r\n[L3542] (Foster care was not easily available in Romania at \r\n[L3543] the time and so was paid for by the study.)

At the end of that time \r\n[L3552] period, each battery\u2019s charge is tested. Result:\r\n[L3553] Batteries stored in the freezer had a higher average \r\n[L3554] charge, and the difference between the groups was \r\n[L3555] statistically significant.

According to \r\n[L3558] Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain,\r\n[L3559] women say nearly three times as many words per day \r\n[L3560] as men. Skeptical researchers devised a study to test \r\n[L3561] this claim. They used electronic devices to record \r\n[L3562] the talking patterns of 396 university students who \r\n[L3563] volunteered to participate in the study. The device \r\n[L3564] was programmed to record 30 seconds of sound \r\n[L3565] every 12.5 minutes without the carrier\u2019s knowledge. \r\n[L3566] According to a published report of the study in \r\n[L3567] Scientific American, \u201cMen showed a slightly wider \r\n[L3568] variability in words uttered.... But in the end, the \r\n[L3569] sexes came out just about even in the daily averages: \r\n[L3570] women at 16,215 words and men at 15,669.\u201d56 This \r\n[L3571] difference was not statistically significant.

One of the better \r\n[L3574] studies of the effect of regular attendance at religious \r\n[L3575] services gathered data from a random sample of \r\n[L3576] 3617 adults. The researchers then measured lots of \r\n[L3577] variables, not just the explanatory variable (religious \r\n[L3578] activities) and the response variable (length of life). \r\n[L3579] A news article said: \u201cChurchgoers were more likely \r\n[L3580] to be nonsmokers, physically active, and at their \r\n[L3581] right weight. But even after health behaviors were \r\n[L3582] taken into account, those not attending religious \r\n[L3583] services regularly still were about 25% more likely to \r\n[L3584] have died.\u201d57 What conclusion can we draw from \r\n[L3585] this study? Explain.\r\n[L3586] 107. Daytime running lights Canada requires that cars \r\n[L3587] be equipped with \u201cdaytime running lights,\u201d \r\n[L3588] headlights that automatically come on at a low \r\n[L3589] level when the car is started. Some manufacturers \r\n[L3590] are now equipping cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3591] with running lights. Will running lights reduce \r\n[L3592] accidents by making cars more visible?

Studying frustration A psychologist wants to study \r\n[L3598] the effects of failure and frustration on the \r\n[L3599] relationships among members of a work team. \r\n[L3600] She forms a team of students, brings them to the \r\n[L3601] psychology lab, and has them play a game that \r\n[L3602] requires teamwork. The game is rigged so that they \r\n[L3603] lose regularly. The psychologist observes the students \r\n[L3604] through a one-way window and notes the changes in \r\n[L3605] their behavior during an evening of game playing. \r\n[L3606] Can the psychologist generalize the results of her \r\n[L3607] study to a team of employees that spends months \r\n[L3608] developing a new product that never works right and \r\n[L3609] is finally abandoned by their company?

The researchers \r\n[L3684] argued that almost all children in the institution \r\n[L3685] quickly became infected anyway. The studies \r\n[L3686] showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis \r\n[L3687] existed. This finding contributed to the development \r\n[L3688] of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, \r\n[L3689] the Willowbrook studies are now considered an \r\n[L3690] example of unethical research. Explain why, \r\n[L3691] according to current ethical standards, useful results \r\n[L3692] are not enough to allow a study.\r\n[L3693] 116.* Unequal benefits Researchers on aging proposed to \r\n[L3694] investigate the effect of supplemental health services \r\n[L3695] on the quality of life of older people. Eligible \r\n[L3696] patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to \r\n[L3697] be randomly assigned to treatment and control \r\n[L3698] groups.

Potatoes are kept refrigerated before being \r\n[L3852] cut for french fries to prevent spoiling and preserve flavor. \r\n[L3853] But immediate processing of cold potatoes causes discol\ufffeoring due to complex chemical reactions. The potatoes \r\n[L3854] must therefore be brought to room temperature before \r\n[L3855] processing. Researchers want to design an experiment in \r\n[L3856] which tasters will rate the color and flavor of french fries \r\n[L3857] prepared from several groups of potatoes. The potatoes \r\n[L3858] will be freshly picked or stored for a month at room tem\ufffeperature or stored for a month refrigerated.

In all, 1347 of the teachers return \r\n[L4085] the survey. Of those who responded, 32% say that they favor \r\n[L4086] some kind of national proficiency test. Which of the follow\ufffeing statements about this situation is true?\r\n[L4087] (a) Since random sampling was used, we can feel confi\ufffedent that the percent of all American high school teachers \r\n[L4088] who would say they favor a national proficiency test is close \r\n[L4089] to 32%.\r\n[L4090] (b) We cannot trust these results, because the survey was \r\n[L4091] mailed. Only survey results from face-to-face interviews are \r\n[L4092] considered valid.\r\n[L4093] (c) Because over half of those who were mailed the survey \r\n[L4094] actually responded, we can feel pretty confident that the ac\ufffetual percent of all American high school teachers who would \r\n[L4095] say they favor a national proficiency test is close to 32%.\r\n[L4096] (d) The results of this survey may be affected by nonre\ufffesponse bias.\r\n[L4097] (e) The results of this survey cannot be trusted due to vol\ufffeuntary response bias.\r\n[L4098] Section II: Free Response Show all your work.

Many people start their day with a jolt of caffeine \r\n[L4140] from coffee or a soft drink. Most experts agree that people \r\n[L4141] who take in large amounts of caffeine each day may suf\ufffefer from physical withdrawal symptoms if they stop ingest\ufffeing their usual amounts of caffeine. Researchers recruited \r\n[L4142] 11 volunteers who were caffeine dependent and who were \r\n[L4143] willing to take part in a caffeine withdrawal experiment. \r\n[L4144] The experiment was conducted on two 2-day periods that \r\n[L4145] occurred one week apart. During one of the 2-day periods, \r\n[L4146] each subject was given a capsule containing the amount \r\n[L4147] of caffeine normally ingested by that subject in one day. \r\n[L4148] During the other study period, the subjects were given pla\ufffecebos.

Those who advocate for monetary incentives in \r\n[L4403] a work environment claim that this type of incentive has \r\n[L4404] the greatest appeal because it allows the winners to do what \r\n[L4405] they want with their winnings.

Not only are there national brands for \r\n[L4428] most products, but many stores have their own in-house \r\n[L4429] brands. Since shelf space is not infinite, the question is \r\n[L4430] how many linear feet to allocate to each product and \r\n[L4431] which shelf (top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle) \r\n[L4432] to put it on. The middle shelf is the most popular and lu\ufffecrative, since many shoppers, if undecided, will simply \r\n[L4433] pick the product that is at eye level. \r\n[L4434] A local store that sells many upscale goods is trying to \r\n[L4435] determine how much shelf space to allocate to its own \r\n[L4436] brand of men\u2019s personal-grooming products.

By the end of the chapter, you\u2019ll be ready to interpret \r\n[L7] the results of this study.\r\n[L8] Early research showed that magnetic fields affected living tissue in humans. Some doc\ufffetors have begun to use magnets to treat patients with chronic pain. Scientists wondered \r\n[L9] whether this type of therapy really worked. They designed a study to find out.\r\n[L10] Fifty patients with chronic pain were recruited for the study. A doctor identified a painful \r\n[L11] site on each patient and asked him or her to rate the pain on a scale from 0 (mild pain) to \r\n[L12] 10 (severe pain). Then, the doctor selected a sealed envelope containing a magnet from a \r\n[L13] box that contained both active and inactive magnets. That way, neither the doctor nor the \r\n[L14] patient knew which type of magnet was being used. The chosen magnet was applied to \r\n[L15] the site of the pain for 45 minutes. After \u201ctreatment,\u201d each patient was again asked to rate \r\n[L16] the level of pain from 0 to 10.\r\n[L17] In all, 29 patients were given active magnets and 21 patients received inactive magnets. \r\n[L18] All but one of the patients rated their initial pain as an 8, 9, or 10.

Here are \r\n[L26] some examples:\r\n[L27] sThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\n[L28] seat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\n[L29] sAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\n[L30] an average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\n[L31] teens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\n[L32] unsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\n[L33] sA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\n[L34] of catching a cold.4\r\n[L35] sFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\n[L36] that listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\n[L37] Can we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\n[L38] depends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\n[L39] look at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\n[L40] Each year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\n[L41] vehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\n[L42] people in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\n[L43] of an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\n[L44] asking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\n[L45] conducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\n[L46] about some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\n[L47] In the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\n[L48] questions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\n[L49] them a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\n[L50] observational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\n[L51] drawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\n[L52] while listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\n[L53] list of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\n[L54] The goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\n[L55] changes in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\n[L56] the ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\n[L57] Here\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\n[L58] ACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\n[L59] MATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\n[L60] clock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\n[L61] Confucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget.

To answer the question, we will interview 16- to 20-year-olds \r\n[L70] who live in the United States and drive. Ideally, we would ask them all (take a \r\n[L71] census). But contacting every driver in this age group wouldn\u2019t be practical: it \r\n[L72] would take too much time and cost too much money. Instead, we put the question \r\n[L73] to a sample chosen to represent the entire population of young drivers.\r\n[L74] 4.1\r\n[L75] In Section 4.1, \r\n[L76] you\u2019ll learn about: \r\n[L77] sThe idea of a sample \r\n[L78] survey\r\n[L79] sHow to sample badly\r\n[L80] sHow to sample well: \r\n[L81] Random sampling\r\n[L82] sOther sampling methods\r\n[L83] sInference for sampling\r\n[L84] sSample surveys: What \r\n[L85] can go wrong?\r\n[L86] 1.

Do not look at the numbers until it is time for you to do the \r\n[L89] experiment.\r\n[L90] 3. Flip a coin to decide which of you is Student A and which is Student B. \r\n[L91] Shuffle the index cards and deal one face down to each partner.\r\n[L92] 4. Student A will attempt a memory task while Student B keeps time.\r\n[L93] Directions: Study the pairs of numbers on the index card for 30 seconds. Then \r\n[L94] turn the card over. Recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.). Then tell your part\ufffener (Student B) what you think the numbers on the card are. Student B will \r\n[L95] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L96] 5. Now it\u2019s Student B\u2019s turn to do a memory task while Student A records the data.\r\n[L97] Directions: Your partner will read the pairs of numbers on your index card aloud \r\n[L98] three times slowly. Next, you will recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.) and \r\n[L99] then tell your partner what you think the numbers on the card are. Student A will \r\n[L100] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L101] 6. Your teacher will scale and label axes on the board for parallel dotplots of the re\ufffesults. Plot the number of pairs you remembered correctly on the appropriate graph.\r\n[L102] 7. Did students in your class remember numbers better when they saw them or \r\n[L103] when they heard them? Give appropriate evidence to support your answer.\r\n[L104] 8. Based on the results of this experiment, can we conclude that people in gen\ufffeeral remember better when they see than when they hear? Why or why not?\r\n[L105] DEFINITION: Population and sample\r\n[L106] The population in a statistical study is the entire group of individuals about which we \r\n[L107] want information.\r\n[L108] A sample is the part of the population from which we actually collect information. We \r\n[L109] use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\n[L110] The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\n[L111] sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\n[L112] Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\n[L113] uses of sampling.","[L114] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L115] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","[L116] 208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L117] EXAMPLE\r\n[L118] EXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\n[L119] Populations and samples\r\n[L120] PROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n[L121] (a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\n[L122] before shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\n[L123] five pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\n[L124] moisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n[L125] (b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\n[L126] SOLUTION:\r\n[L127] (a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\n[L128] that are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n[L129] (b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\n[L130] For Practice Try Exercise 1\r\n[L131] The Idea of a Sample Survey\r\n[L132] We often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\n[L133] basis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\n[L134] and ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\n[L135] cream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\n[L136] whole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\n[L137] varied population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\n[L138] The first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\n[L139] what population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\n[L140] exactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\n[L141] We reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\n[L142] example. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\n[L143] or \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\n[L144] or more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example. We\u2019ll avoid this more \r\n[L145] restrictive terminology.\r\n[L146] Sample survey\r\n[L147] How Does the Current Population Survey Work?\r\n[L148] A sample survey\r\n[L149] One of the most important government sample surveys in the United States is \r\n[L150] the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS).

A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\n[L164] easiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\n[L165] produce unrepresentative data.\r\n[L166] other economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\n[L167] specify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\n[L168] all U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\n[L169] not in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\n[L170] news refers to this specific population.\r\n[L171] What does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\n[L172] for example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\n[L173] she is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\n[L174] first asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\n[L175] work in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\n[L176] you are not in the labor force.\r\n[L177] If you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\n[L178] you did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\n[L179] you are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\n[L180] pay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\n[L181] because of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason. An unemployment rate \r\n[L182] of 9.7% means that 9.7% of the sample was unemployed, using the exact CPS \r\n[L183] definitions of both \u201clabor force\u201d and \u201cunemployed.\u201d\r\n[L184] DEFINITION: Convenience sample\r\n[L185] Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach results in a convenience sample.\r\n[L186] What\u2019s wrong with our convenience sample of students in the library? It\u2019s \r\n[L187] unlikely that this sample represents the homework habits of all students at the \r\n[L188] school well. In fact, we\u2019d expect the sample to overestimate the average homework \r\n[L189] time in the population since students who hang out in the library might tend to \r\n[L190] be more studious. This is bias: using a method that will consistently overestimate \r\n[L191] or underestimate the value you want to know.","[L192] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bea60ae105051c9#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_4.jpg","size_bytes":53957,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L193] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>","[L194] 210 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L195] EXAMPLE\r\n[L196] DEFINITION: Bias\r\n[L197] The design of a statistical study shows bias if it systematically favors certain outcomes.\r\n[L198] Convenience samples are almost guaranteed to show bias. So are voluntary \r\n[L199] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L200] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L201] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L202] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L203] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L204] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L205] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L206] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L207] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L208] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L209] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L210] to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\n[L211] Illegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\n[L212] Online polls\r\n[L213] Former CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\n[L214] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L215] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L216] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L217] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L218] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L219] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L220] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L221] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L222] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L223] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L224] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L225] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L226] the direction of the bias.

In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L247] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L248] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L249] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L250] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L251] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L252] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L253] random sample.\r\n[L254] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L255] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L256] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L257] sample actually selected.\r\n[L258] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L259] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L260] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L261] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L262] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L263] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L264] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L265] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L266] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L267] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L268] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L269] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L270] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L271] if the population is large. Think about the \r\n[L272] Current Population Survey, for example, \r\n[L273] Random sampling","[L274] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://3a54b1107c99c35#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_6.jpg","size_bytes":57187,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L275] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>","[L276] 212 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L277] which must draw a sample of size 60,000 every month from the population of \r\n[L278] over 117 million U.S. households.\r\n[L279] In practice, people use random numbers generated by a computer or calcula\ufffetor to choose samples. If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L280] random digits.\r\n[L281] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L282] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L283] these properties:\r\n[L284] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L285] s The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\n[L286] gives no information about any other part.\r\n[L287] Table D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\n[L288] digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\n[L289] in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\n[L290] the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\n[L291] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L292] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L293] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L294] same length.\r\n[L295] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L296] from Table D.\r\n[L297] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L298] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L299] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L300] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L301] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L302] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L303] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L304] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L305] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L306] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L307] and so on\u2014because the table has no order. We recommend reading across rows \r\n[L308] from left to right.","[L309] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://fed072027c0760d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_7.jpg","size_bytes":43027,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L310] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 75>","[L311] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 213\r\n[L312] Spring Break!\r\n[L313] Choosing an SRS with Table D\r\n[L314] The school newspaper is planning an article on family-friendly \r\n[L315] places to stay over spring break at a nearby beach town.

The applet sampled without replacement from the \u201cPopulation hop\ufffeper,\u201d but the calculator sampled with replacement from the specified population. \r\n[L397] As a result, the calculator sometimes selects the same number more than once in \r\n[L398] a given sample. To deal with this problem, you can generate additional random \r\n[L399] numbers as needed to replace any repeats. Or you can use a method other than \r\n[L400] randInt (like randSamp on the TI-Nspire) to sample without replacement. Refer \r\n[L401] to your device\u2019s reference manual or ask your teacher.\r\n[L402] We can trust results from an SRS, as well as from other types of random samples \r\n[L403] that we will meet later, because the use of impersonal chance avoids bias. Online\r\n[L404] and call-in polls also produce samples. But we can\u2019t trust results from these sam\ufffeples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. The first question to ask about \r\n[L405] any sample is whether it was chosen at random.\r\n[L406] Other Sampling Methods\r\n[L407] The basic idea of sampling is straightforward: take an SRS from the population \r\n[L408] and use your sample results to gain information about the population. Unfor\ufffetunately, it\u2019s usually very difficult to actually get an SRS from the population of \r\n[L409] interest. Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L410] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L411] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L412] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L413] selected.

Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L420] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L421] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L422] between strata.\r\n[L423] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L424] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L425] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L426] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L427] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L428] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L429] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L430] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L431] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size.

Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L435] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L436] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L437] money she\u2019ll make from selling them. It would take too much time to \r\n[L438] count the plants in all 100 squares, so she\u2019ll accept an estimate based on \r\n[L439] a sample of 10 squares.\r\n[L440] 1. Use Table D or technology to take a simple random sample of 10 \r\n[L441] grid squares. Record the location (for example, B6) of each square you \r\n[L442] select.\r\n[L443] 2. This time, you\u2019ll take a stratified random sample using the \r\n[L444] rows as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select \r\n[L445] one square from each (horizontal) row. Record the location of \r\n[L446] each square.\r\n[L447] 3. Now, take a stratified random sample using the columns\r\n[L448] as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select one \r\n[L449] square from each (vertical) column. Record the location of \r\n[L450] each square.\r\n[L451] 4. The table on page N/DS-6 gives the actual number of \r\n[L452] sunflowers in each grid square. Use the information provided \r\n[L453] to calculate your estimate of the mean number of sunflowers \r\n[L454] per square for each of your samples in Steps 1, 2, and 3. 10\r\n[L455] 9\r\n[L456] 8\r\n[L457] 7\r\n[L458] 6\r\n[L459] 5\r\n[L460] 4\r\n[L461] 3\r\n[L462] 2\r\n[L463] 1\r\n[L464] ABCDE FGH I J","[L465] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://4ec2fd9c327650e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60115,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L466] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 75>","[L467] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 217\r\n[L468] EXAMPLE\r\n[L469] 5.

How did the three sampling methods do?\r\n[L472] The following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\n[L473] in the music business.\r\n[L474] Who Wrote That Song?\r\n[L475] Using a stratified random sample\r\n[L476] A radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\n[L477] The organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\n[L478] members by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\n[L479] ASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\n[L480] year. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L481] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L482] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L483] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L484] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L485] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L486] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L487] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L488] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L489] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L490] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L491] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L492] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L493] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups. Ideally, these \r\n[L494] clusters should mirror the characteristics of the population. Then choose an SRS of the \r\n[L495] clusters. All individuals in the chosen clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L496] Imagine a large high school that assigns its students to homerooms alphabeti\ufffecally by last name.

They don\u2019t offer the statistical advantage of better information about the \r\n[L507] population that stratified random samples do. That\u2019s because clusters are often \r\n[L508] chosen for ease or convenience, so they may have as much variability as the popu\ufffelation itself. Be sure you understand the difference between strata and clusters. \r\n[L509] We want each stratum to contain similar individuals, and for there to be large \r\n[L510] differences between strata. For a cluster sample, we\u2019d like each cluster to look just \r\n[L511] like the population, but on a smaller scale.\r\n[L512] Sampling at a School Assembly\r\n[L513] Strata or clusters?\r\n[L514] The student council wants to conduct a survey during the first \r\n[L515] five minutes of an all-school assembly in the auditorium about \r\n[L516] use of the school library. They would like to announce the \r\n[L517] results of the survey at the end of the assembly.

Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L619] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L620] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L621] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L622] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L623] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L624] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L625] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L626] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L627] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L628] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L629] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L630] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L631] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L632] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L633] Sampling Units, or PSUs. Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\n[L634] the 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\n[L635] of the others.\r\n[L636] Stage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\n[L637] Stratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\n[L638] Stage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\n[L639] units. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\n[L640] Analyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\n[L641] beyond basic statistics. But the SRS is the building block of more elaborate \r\n[L642] methods, and the principles of analysis remain much the same for these other \r\n[L643] methods.\r\n[L644] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L645] The manager of a sports arena wants to learn more about the financial status of the people \r\n[L646] who are attending an NBA basketball game.

The \r\n[L666] process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\n[L667] called inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\n[L668] we know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\n[L669] response samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\n[L670] the population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\n[L671] selecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\n[L672] Still, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\n[L673] the entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\n[L674] the monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\n[L675] population. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\n[L676] almost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\n[L677] Inference\r\n[L678] ACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\n[L679] MATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\n[L680] other container that students can\u2019t see through\r\n[L681] In this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\n[L682] in relation to the population truth.\r\n[L683] 1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\n[L684] particular color.\r\n[L685] 2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\n[L686] record the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\n[L687] returned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n[L688] 3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\n[L689] is the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\n[L690] center? Is there a clear shape?\r\n[L691] Why can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\n[L692] results of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\n[L693] Because we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\n[L694] govern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\n[L695] results are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\n[L696] random sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\n[L697] the population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\n[L698] sets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\n[L699] for sampling later.\r\n[L700] One point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples. For instance, in the Activity, \r\n[L701] you would get a better estimate of the proportion of red chips in the popula\ufffeMargin of error","[L702] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 16 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://136106c58c36cbc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_15.jpg","size_bytes":54135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L703] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>","[L704] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 221\r\n[L705] tion using random samples of 40 chips than 20 chips. By taking a very large \r\n[L706] sample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\n[L707] about the population.\r\n[L708] The Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\n[L709] expect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\n[L710] of the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n[L711] 3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\n[L712] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L713] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L714] clicked a response.\r\n[L715] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L716] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L717] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L718] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L719] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L720] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L721] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L722] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L723] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L724] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L725] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L726] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L727] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L728] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L729] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L730] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L731] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L732] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L733] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L734] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L735] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L736] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L737] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L738] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L739] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L740] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L741] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L742] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L743] Sampling frame","[L744] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L745] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","[L746] 222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L747] EXAMPLE\r\n[L748] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L749] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L750] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L751] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L752] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L753] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L754] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L755] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L756] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L757] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L758] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L759] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L760] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L761] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L762] refuses to participate.\r\n[L763] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L764] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L765] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L766] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L767] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L768] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L769] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L770] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L771] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L772] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L773] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L774] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L775] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L776] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L777] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L778] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L779] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","[L780] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L781] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","[L782] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L783] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L784] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L785] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L786] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L787] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L788] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L789] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L790] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L791] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L792] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L793] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L794] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L795] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L796] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L797] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L798] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L799] memory. \u201cHave you visited a dentist in the last 6 months?\u201d will often draw a \r\n[L800] \u201cYes\u201d from someone who last visited a dentist 8 months ago.10 Careful training \r\n[L801] of interviewers and careful supervision to avoid variation among the interview\ufffeers can reduce response bias.

Confusing or leading questions can introduce strong bias, and \r\n[L809] changes in wording can greatly change a survey\u2019s outcome. Even the order in \r\n[L810] which questions are asked matters.\r\n[L811] How Do Americans Feel about Illegal Immigrants?\r\n[L812] Question wording matters\r\n[L813] \u201cShould illegal immigrants be prosecuted and deported for being in the U.S. illegally, \r\n[L814] or shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Asked this question in an opinion poll, 69% favored deportation. \r\n[L815] But when the very same sample was asked whether illegal immigrants who have \r\n[L816] worked in the United States for two years \u201cshould be given a chance to keep their jobs \r\n[L817] and eventually apply for legal status,\u201d 62% said that they should. Different questions \r\n[L818] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L819] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L820] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L821] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L822] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L823] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L824] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L825] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L826] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L827] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L828] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L829] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L830] 1. Each of the following is a source of error in a sample survey. Label each as sampling\r\n[L831] error or nonsampling error, and explain your answers.\r\n[L832] (a) The telephone directory is used as a sampling frame.\r\n[L833] (b) The person cannot be contacted in five calls.\r\n[L834] (c) Interviewers choose people walking by on the sidewalk to interview.\r\n[L835] 2. A survey paid for by makers of disposable diapers found that 84% of the sample opposed \r\n[L836] banning disposable diapers. Here is the actual question:\r\n[L837] It is estimated that disposable diapers account for less than 2% of the trash in today\u2019s \r\n[L838] landfills. In contrast, beverage containers, third-class mail and yard wastes are estimated\r\n[L839] to account for about 21% of the trash in landfills. Given this, in your opinion, would it \r\n[L840] be fair to ban disposable diapers?11\r\n[L841] Explain how the wording of the question could result in bias.

We base conclusions about the \r\n[L852] population on data from the sample. It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L853] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L854] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L855] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L856] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L857] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L858] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L859] process.\r\n[L860] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L861] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L862] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L863] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L864] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L865] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L866] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L867] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L868] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L869] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L870] prone to large bias.\r\n[L871] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L872] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L873] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L874] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L875] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L876] errors. These have nothing to do with choosing a sample\u2014they are \r\n[L877] present even in a census. The single biggest problem for sample surveys \r\n[L878] is nonresponse: people can\u2019t be contacted or refuse to answer. Incorrect \r\n[L879] answers by respondents can lead to response bias.

Student archaeologists An archaeological dig turns \r\n[L895] up large numbers of pottery shards, broken stone \r\n[L896] tools, and other artifacts. Students working on the \r\n[L897] project classify each artifact and assign it a number. \r\n[L898] The counts in different categories are important for \r\n[L899] understanding the site, so the project director chooses \r\n[L900] 2% of the artifacts at random and checks the students\u2019 \r\n[L901] work.

Sampling stuffed envelopes A large retailer prepares \r\n[L903] its customers\u2019 monthly credit card bills using an \r\n[L904] automatic machine that folds the bills, stuffs them \r\n[L905] into envelopes, and seals the envelopes for mailing. \r\n[L906] Are the envelopes completely sealed?

Sleepless nights How much sleep do high school \r\n[L949] students get on a typical school night? An interested \r\n[L950] student designed a survey to find out. To make data \r\n[L951] collection easier, the student surveyed the first 100 \r\n[L952] students to arrive at school on a particular morning. \r\n[L953] These students reported an average of 7.2 hours of \r\n[L954] sleep on the previous night.\r\n[L955] (a) What type of sample did the student obtain?\r\n[L956] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased.

Management would like to ensure \r\n[L1045] that the phones\u2019 display screens meet their quality \r\n[L1046] standards before shipping them to retail stores. Since \r\n[L1047] it takes about 10 minutes to inspect an individual \r\n[L1048] phone\u2019s display screen, managers decide to inspect a \r\n[L1049] sample of 20 phones from the day\u2019s production.\r\n[L1050] (a) Explain why it would be difficult for managers to \r\n[L1051] inspect an SRS of 20 iPhones that are produced today.\r\n[L1052] (b) An eager employee suggests that it would be easy \r\n[L1053] to inspect the last 20 iPhones that were produced \r\n[L1054] today. Why isn\u2019t this a good idea?\r\n[L1055] (c) Another employee recommends inspecting every \r\n[L1056] fiftieth iPhone that is produced.

Why is \r\n[L1067] this sampling method biased?\r\n[L1068] (c) Suppose that a more complicated random sam\ufffepling plan is carried out, and that 35% of the pine trees \r\n[L1069] in the sample are infested by the pine beetle. Can \r\n[L1070] scientists conclude that 35% of all the pine trees on the \r\n[L1071] west side of the park are infested? Why or why not?\r\n[L1072] 19. Who goes to the convention?

It decides to choose those who will \r\n[L1087] go by random selection. How will you label the two \r\n[L1088] strata? Use Table D, beginning at line 123, to choose \r\n[L1089] a stratified random sample of 4 students and 2 faculty \r\n[L1090] members.\r\n[L1091] 20. Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\n[L1092] stratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\n[L1093] records of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\n[L1094] stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\n[L1095] and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\n[L1096] One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\n[L1097] these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\n[L1098] amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000. Using these \r\n[L1099] groups as strata, you decide to verify all the largest \r\n[L1100] accounts and to sample 5% of the midsize accounts \r\n[L1101] and 1% of the small accounts. How would you label \r\n[L1102] the two strata from which you will sample? Use Table \r\n[L1103] D, starting at line 115, to select only the first 3 \r\n[L1104] accounts from each of these strata.\r\n[L1105] 21. Go Blue! Michigan Stadium, also known as \u201cThe Big \r\n[L1106] House,\u201d seats over 100,000 fans for a football game. \r\n[L1107] The University of Michigan athletic department plans \r\n[L1108] to conduct a survey about concessions that are sold \r\n[L1109] during games. Tickets are most expensive for seats \r\n[L1110] near the field and on the sideline. The cheapest seats \r\n[L1111] are high up in the end zones (where one of the au\ufffethors sat as a student).

The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L1153] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L1154] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L1155] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L1156] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L1157] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L1158] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L1159] might be preferable to an SRS in this case. What \r\n[L1160] would you use as strata?\r\n[L1161] (b) Why might a cluster sample be a simpler option? \r\n[L1162] What would you use as clusters?\r\n[L1163] 23. Is it an SRS? A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L1164] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L1165] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L1166] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L1167] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L1168] Explain your answer.\r\n[L1169] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L1170] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L1171] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L1172] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L1173] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L1174] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L1175] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L1176] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L1177] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L1178] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L1179] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L1180] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L1181] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L1182] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L1183] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L1184] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L1185] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L1186] method?\r\n[L1187] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L1188] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L1189] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L1190] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L1191] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L1192] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L1193] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L1194] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1195] sample.\r\n[L1196] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L1197] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L1198] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L1199] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L1200] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L1201] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L1202] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L1203] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L1204] pg 218","[L1205] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1206] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","[L1207] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L1208] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1209] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200. Enter the \r\n[L1210] table at line 120.\r\n[L1211] (b) Like an SRS, a systematic random sample gives \r\n[L1212] all individuals the same chance to be chosen. Explain \r\n[L1213] why this is true. Then explain carefully why a system\ufffeatic sample is not an SRS.\r\n[L1214] 27. Sampling frame Ideally, the sampling frame in a \r\n[L1215] sample survey should list every individual in the \r\n[L1216] population, but in practice, this is often difficult. \r\n[L1217] Suppose that a sample of households in a community \r\n[L1218] is selected at random from the telephone directory. \r\n[L1219] Explain how this sampling method results in under\ufffecoverage that could lead to bias.\r\n[L1220] 28. Sampling frame Refer to the previous exercise. It is \r\n[L1221] more common in telephone surveys to use random \r\n[L1222] digit dialing equipment that selects the last four digits \r\n[L1223] of a telephone number at random after being given \r\n[L1224] the exchange (the first three digits). Explain how this \r\n[L1225] sampling method results in undercoverage that could \r\n[L1226] lead to bias.\r\n[L1227] 29. Baseball tickets Suppose you want to know the \r\n[L1228] average amount of money spent by the fans attending \r\n[L1229] opening day for the Cleveland Indians baseball sea\ufffeson. You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\n[L1230] to conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\n[L1231] allow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\n[L1232] seats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\n[L1233] you randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\n[L1234] stadium. During the game, you ask the fans in those \r\n[L1235] seats how much they spent that day.\r\n[L1236] (a) Provide a reason why this survey might yield a \r\n[L1237] biased result.\r\n[L1238] (b) Explain whether the reason you provided in (a) is \r\n[L1239] a sampling error or a nonsampling error.\r\n[L1240] 30. What kind of error? Which of the following are \r\n[L1241] sources of sampling error and which are sources of \r\n[L1242] nonsampling error? Explain your answers.\r\n[L1243] (a) The subject lies about past drug use.\r\n[L1244] (b) A typing error is made in recording the data.\r\n[L1245] (c) Data are gathered by asking people to mail in a \r\n[L1246] coupon printed in a newspaper.\r\n[L1247] 31. Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\n[L1248] sampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\n[L1249] the United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n[L1250] 5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\n[L1251] estimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n[L1252] (a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n[L1253] (b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\n[L1254] survey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n[L1255] 32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\n[L1256] in telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\n[L1257] call is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\n[L1258] The Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\n[L1259] nonresponse to a government survey of households \r\n[L1260] in Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\n[L1261] July 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\n[L1262] and 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\n[L1263] period versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\n[L1264] period.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\n[L1265] rate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\n[L1266] nonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n[L1267] 33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n[L1268] 31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\n[L1269] answer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\n[L1270] drove through, how many of them were red when you \r\n[L1271] entered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n[L1272] 171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\n[L1273] practical problem with this survey is that people may \r\n[L1274] not give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\n[L1275] of the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n[L1276] 880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n[L1277] 34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\n[L1278] belt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\n[L1279] chosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\n[L1280] they were invited to answer questions that included \r\n[L1281] questions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\n[L1282] always used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\n[L1283] seat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\n[L1284] lots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey. Do you expect bias in the same \r\n[L1285] direction in most surveys about seat belt use?\r\n[L1286] 35. Wording bias Comment on each of the following \r\n[L1287] as a potential sample survey question. Is the question \r\n[L1288] clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1289] (a) \u201cSome cell phone users have developed brain \r\n[L1290] cancer. Should all cell phones come with a warning \r\n[L1291] label explaining the danger of using cell phones?\u201d\r\n[L1292] (b) \u201cDo you agree that a national system of health \r\n[L1293] insurance should be favored because it would provide \r\n[L1294] health insurance for everyone and would reduce \r\n[L1295] administrative costs?\u201d\r\n[L1296] (c) \u201cIn view of escalating environmental degradation \r\n[L1297] and incipient resource depletion, would you favor \r\n[L1298] economic incentives for recycling of resource\ufffeintensive consumer goods?\u201d\r\n[L1299] 36. Checking for bias Comment on each of the fol\ufffelowing as a potential sample survey question. Is the \r\n[L1300] question clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1301] (a) Which of the following best represents your \r\n[L1302] opinion on gun control?\r\n[L1303] 1.

This section is about \r\n[L1408] statistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\n[L1409] Observational Study versus Experiment\r\n[L1410] In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\n[L1411] ask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\n[L1412] response. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\n[L1413] of a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\n[L1414] DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\n[L1415] An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\n[L1416] does not attempt to influence the responses.\r\n[L1417] An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\n[L1418] responses.\r\n[L1419] The goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\n[L1420] to compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\n[L1421] of an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\n[L1422] response. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\n[L1423] way to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\n[L1424] see the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\n[L1425] is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\n[L1426] data. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\n[L1427] is one of the most important in statistics.\r\n[L1428] Does Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\n[L1429] after Menopause?\r\n[L1430] Observation versus experiment\r\n[L1431] Should women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\n[L1432] production of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\n[L1433] a heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\n[L1434] small compared with the benefits.\r\n[L1435] The evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\n[L1436] hormones with others who were not. But the women who chose to \r\n[L1437] take hormones were richer and better educated and saw doctors \r\n[L1438] more often than women who didn\u2019t take hormones. Because the \r\n[L1439] 4.2\r\n[L1440] In Section 4.2, \r\n[L1441] you\u2019ll learn about: \r\n[L1442] sObservational study \r\n[L1443] versus experiment\r\n[L1444] sThe language of \r\n[L1445] experiments\r\n[L1446] sHow to experiment \r\n[L1447] badly\r\n[L1448] sHow to experiment \r\n[L1449] well: The randomized \r\n[L1450] comparative experiment\r\n[L1451] sThree principles of \r\n[L1452] experimental design\r\n[L1453] sExperiments: What can \r\n[L1454] go wrong?\r\n[L1455] sInference for experiments\r\n[L1456] sBlocking\r\n[L1457] sMatched pairs design\r\n[L1458] Section 4.2 Experiments 231","[L1459] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 27 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://7aacadbacce6f03#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_26.jpg","size_bytes":68207,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1460] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>","[L1461] 232 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1462] women who took hormones did many other things to maintain their health, it isn\u2019t \r\n[L1463] surprising that they had fewer heart attacks.\r\n[L1464] To get convincing data on the link between hormone replacement and heart \r\n[L1465] attacks, we should do an experiment. Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L1466] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L1467] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L1468] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L1469] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L1470] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L1471] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L1472] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L1473] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L1474] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L1475] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L1476] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L1477] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L1478] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L1479] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L1480] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L1481] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L1482] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L1483] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L1484] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L1485] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L1486] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L1487] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L1488] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L1489] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L1490] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L1491] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L1492] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L1493] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L1494] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L1495] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L1496] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L1497] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","[L1498] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1499] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","[L1500] Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L1501] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L1502] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L1503] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L1504] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L1505] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L1506] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L1507] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L1508] results of the earlier observational studies.

Here is the basic vocabulary of experiments.\r\n[L1526] DEFINITION: Treatment, experimental units, subjects\r\n[L1527] A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment.\r\n[L1528] If an experiment has several explanatory variables, a treatment is a combination of \r\n[L1529] specific values of these variables.\r\n[L1530] The experimental units are the smallest collection of individuals to which treatments \r\n[L1531] are applied. When the units are human beings, they often are called subjects.\r\n[L1532] The best way to learn the language of experiments is to practice using it.\r\n[L1533] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1534] are asked to identify a \r\n[L1535] possible confounding \r\n[L1536] variable in a given \r\n[L1537] setting, you are \r\n[L1538] expected to explain how \r\n[L1539] the variable you choose \r\n[L1540] (1) is associated with \r\n[L1541] the explanatory variable \r\n[L1542] and (2) affects the \r\n[L1543] response variable.","[L1544] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1545] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>","[L1546] 234 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1547] EXAMPLE When Will I Ever Use This Stuff?\r\n[L1548] Vocabulary of experiments\r\n[L1549] Researchers at the University of North Carolina were concerned about the \r\n[L1550] increasing dropout rate in the state\u2019s high schools, especially for low-income stu\ufffedents. Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\n[L1551] started to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\n[L1552] To change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\n[L1553] the topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\n[L1554] To test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\n[L1555] the schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\n[L1556] standard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\n[L1557] curriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\n[L1558] years, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\n[L1559] scores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\n[L1560] high school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\n[L1561] greater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\n[L1562] PROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\n[L1563] in the CareerStart experiment.\r\n[L1564] SOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\n[L1565] variable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\n[L1566] compares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\n[L1567] behavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\n[L1568] The previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\n[L1569] trying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\n[L1570] all 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\n[L1571] of schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\n[L1572] researchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\n[L1573] systematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\n[L1574] students from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\n[L1575] program made the difference.\r\n[L1576] Sometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\n[L1577] experiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\n[L1578] treatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\n[L1579] the factors. Here\u2019s an example of a multifactor experiment.\r\n[L1580] Factors\r\n[L1581] Level\r\n[L1582] For Practice Try Exercise 51","[L1583] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://26b92d516ab78a7#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_29.jpg","size_bytes":63833,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1584] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>","[L1585] Section 4.2 Experiments 235\r\n[L1586] EXAMPLE TV Advertising\r\n[L1587] Experiments with multiple explanatory variables\r\n[L1588] What are the effects of repeated exposure to an advertising message? The answer \r\n[L1589] may depend on both the length of the ad and on how often it is repeat\ufffeed. An experiment investigated this question using undergraduate stu\ufffedents as subjects. All subjects viewed a 40-minute television program \r\n[L1590] that included ads for a digital camera. Some subjects saw a 30-second \r\n[L1591] commercial; others, a 90-second version. The same commercial was \r\n[L1592] shown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After viewing, all the \r\n[L1593] subjects answered questions about their recall of the ad, their attitude \r\n[L1594] toward the camera, and their intention to purchase it.21\r\n[L1595] PROBLEM: For the advertising study,\r\n[L1596] (a) identify the explanatory and response variables, and\r\n[L1597] (b) list all the treatments.\r\n[L1598] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1599] (a) This experiment has 2 explanatory variables (factors): \r\n[L1600] length of the commercial and number of repetitions. The response \r\n[L1601] variables include measures of subjects\u2019 recall of the ad, their \r\n[L1602] attitudes about the digital camera, and whether they intend to \r\n[L1603] purchase it.\r\n[L1604] (b) There are 2 different lengths of commercial (30 and 90 seconds) \r\n[L1605] and three different numbers of repetitions (1, 3, and 5). The 6 combi\ufffenations consisting of one level of each factor form the 6 treatments \r\n[L1606] shown in Figure 4.3: (1) 30 seconds, 1 time; (2) 30 seconds, 3 times; \r\n[L1607] (3) 30 seconds, 5 times; (4) 90 seconds, 1 time; (5) 90 seconds, \r\n[L1608] 3 times; (6) 90 seconds, 5 times.\r\n[L1609] This example shows how experiments allow us to study the combined effect of \r\n[L1610] several factors. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\n[L1611] not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\n[L1612] commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\n[L1613] interest. But if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers \r\n[L1614] get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. The two-factor experiment in \r\n[L1615] the TV advertising example will help us find out.\r\n[L1616] How to Experiment Badly \r\n[L1617] Experiments are the preferred method for examining the effect of one variable on \r\n[L1618] another. By imposing the specific treatment of interest and controlling other \r\n[L1619] influences, we can pin down cause and effect. Good designs are essential for \r\n[L1620] effective experiments, just as they are for sampling.

This year, budget cuts will allow the school to offer only an \r\n[L1649] online version of the course. Over the past 10 years, the average SAT \r\n[L1650] score of students in the classroom course was 1620. The online group \r\n[L1651] gets an average score of 1780. That\u2019s roughly 10% higher than the long\ufffetime average for those who took the classroom review course. Is the \r\n[L1652] online course more effective?\r\n[L1653] This experiment has a very simple design. A group of subjects (the \r\n[L1654] students) were exposed to a treatment (the online course), and the \r\n[L1655] outcome (SAT scores) was observed. Here is the design:\r\n[L1656] Students \u2192 Online course \u2192 SAT scores\r\n[L1657] A closer look showed that the students in the online review course \r\n[L1658] were quite different from the students who took the classroom course \r\n[L1659] in past years. They had higher GPAs and were taking more AP classes.\r\n[L1660] The effect of online versus in-class instruction is mixed up with the \r\n[L1661] effect of these lurking variables. Maybe the online students earned \r\n[L1662] higher SAT scores because they were smarter to begin with, not \r\n[L1663] because the online course prepared them better. This confounding \r\n[L1664] prevents us from concluding that the online course is more effective than class\uffferoom instruction.\r\n[L1665] Many laboratory experiments use a design like the one in the online SAT course \r\n[L1666] example:\r\n[L1667] Experimental units \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Measure response\r\n[L1668] In the lab environment, simple designs often work well. Field experiments and \r\n[L1669] experiments with animals or people deal with more variable conditions.

Most well-designed experiments compare \r\n[L1675] two or more treatments.\r\n[L1676] Comparison alone isn\u2019t enough to produce results we can trust. If the treat\ufffements are given to groups that differ greatly when the experiment begins, bias will \r\n[L1677] result.

Put all the slips in a hat and mix them thoroughly. Draw them out one \r\n[L1703] at a time until you have 25 slips. These 25 students will take the online course. The \r\n[L1704] remaining 25 students will take the classroom course. Alternatively, you could write \r\n[L1705] \u201conline\u201d on 25 of the slips and \u201cclassroom\u201d on the other 25 slips. Then put the slips in \r\n[L1706] a hat and mix them well. Have students come up one by one and (without looking) pick a slip from the \r\n[L1707] hat.

It is randomized because the sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments by chance. The diagram in Figure 4.4 presents \r\n[L1725] the details: random assignment, the sizes of the groups and which treatment they \r\n[L1726] receive, and the response variable. There are, as we will see later, statistical rea\ufffesons for using treatment groups that are about equal in size.

It does \r\n[L1748] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L1749] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L1750] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L1751] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L1752] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L1753] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L1754] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1755] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L1756] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L1757] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L1758] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L1759] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L1760] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L1761] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L1762] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L1763] than it really is.\r\n[L1764] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments. Here \r\n[L1765] is an experiment that compares three treatments.\r\n[L1766] ?\r\n[L1767] THINK\r\n[L1768] ABOUT\r\n[L1769] IT","[L1770] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 34 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://805b683d71708bc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_33.jpg","size_bytes":52261,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1771] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 75>","[L1772] Section 4.2 Experiments 239\r\n[L1773] EXAMPLE Conserving Energy\r\n[L1774] A completely randomized design\r\n[L1775] Many utility companies have introduced programs to encourage energy con\ufffeservation among their customers. An electric company considers placing small \r\n[L1776] digital displays in households to show current electricity use and what the cost \r\n[L1777] would be if this use continued for a month. Will the displays reduce electricity \r\n[L1778] use? One cheaper approach is to give customers a chart and information about \r\n[L1779] monitoring their electricity use from their outside meter. Would this method \r\n[L1780] work almost as well? The company decides to conduct an experiment to com\ufffepare these two approaches (display, chart) with a control group of customers \r\n[L1781] who receive information about energy consumption but no help in monitoring \r\n[L1782] electricity use.\r\n[L1783] PROBLEM: Outline a completely randomized design involving 60 single-family residences in the \r\n[L1784] same city who are willing to participate in such an experiment.

You might be thinking that the change \r\n[L1843] in electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\n[L1844] would tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\n[L1845] Suppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\n[L1846] households might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\n[L1847] whether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\n[L1848] confounding?!)\r\n[L1849] Many experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\n[L1850] group that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\n[L1851] an active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\n[L1852] developed drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\n[L1853] work. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\n[L1854] control group.\r\n[L1855] Some experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group. That\u2019s appropriate \r\n[L1856] if researchers simply want to compare the effects of several treatments, and not \r\n[L1857] to determine whether any of them works better than an inactive treatment. For \r\n[L1858] instance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\n[L1859] of paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\n[L1860] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L1861] Music students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately.

Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L1863] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L1864] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L1865] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L1866] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L1867] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment.

Provide enough detail that \r\n[L1870] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L1871] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L1872] Three Principles of \r\n[L1873] Experimental Design\r\n[L1874] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L1875] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L1876] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L1877] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L1878] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1879] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L1880] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L1881] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L1882] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1883] ?\r\n[L1884] THINK\r\n[L1885] ABOUT\r\n[L1886] IT","[L1887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","[L1888] Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L1889] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1890] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L1891] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L1892] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L1893] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L1894] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L1895] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L1896] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L1897] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L1898] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L1899] between the groups.\r\n[L1900] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L1901] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L1902] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L1903] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L1904] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L1905] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L1906] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L1907] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L1908] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L1909] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L1910] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L1911] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L1912] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L1913] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L1914] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L1915] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L1916] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L1917] experiment.\r\n[L1918] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L1919] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L1920] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks? The Phy\ufffesicians\u2019 Health Study was a medical experiment that helped answer this ques\ufffetion. In fact, the Physicians\u2019 Health Study looked at the effects of two drugs: \r\n[L1921] aspirin and beta-carotene. Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\n[L1922] help prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\n[L1923] male physicians. There were two explanatory variables (factors), each having \r\n[L1924] two levels: aspirin (yes or no) and beta-carotene (yes or no).

One\ufffefourth of the subjects were assigned at random to each of these treatments.\r\n[L1931] On odd-numbered days, the subjects took either a tablet that contained as\ufffepirin or a dummy pill that looked and tasted like the aspirin but had no \r\n[L1932] active ingredient (a placebo). On even-numbered days, they took either a \r\n[L1933] capsule containing beta-carotene or a placebo. There were several response \r\n[L1934] variables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\n[L1935] other medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\n[L1936] only 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\n[L1937] large enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\n[L1938] attacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\n[L1939] preventing cancer.\r\n[L1940] PROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\n[L1941] design was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\n[L1942] SOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\n[L1943] lurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\n[L1944] treatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\n[L1945] schedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\n[L1946] which subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\n[L1947] helped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\n[L1948] begin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\n[L1949] replication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\n[L1950] the groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\n[L1951] the random assignment.\r\n[L1952] The control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n[L1953] (placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\n[L1954] Experiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L1955] The logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\n[L1956] all the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\n[L1957] that all subjects really are treated identically.\r\n[L1958] If some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\n[L1959] group takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\n[L1960] the subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\n[L1961] experiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\n[L1962] On even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo. Many patients respond favorably to any treatment, even a placebo, perhaps \r\n[L1963] because they trust the doctor. The response to a dummy treatment is called the \r\n[L1964] Placebo\r\n[L1965] Factor 1:\r\n[L1966] Aspirin\r\n[L1967] Factor 2: Beta-carotene\r\n[L1968] Yes\r\n[L1969] Yes No\r\n[L1970] Aspirin Beta-carotene Aspirin Placebo\r\n[L1971] No\r\n[L1972] Placebo Beta-carotene Placebo Placebo\r\n[L1973] FIGURE 4.6 The treatments in the \r\n[L1974] Physicians\u2019 Health Study.","[L1975] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b06f1b5c1816f6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_37.jpg","size_bytes":61000,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1976] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>","[L1977] Section 4.2 Experiments 243\r\n[L1978] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1979] placebo effect.

Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\n[L1985] that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\n[L1986] heads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n[L1987] 24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\n[L1988] active medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\n[L1989] the pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\n[L1990] significantly less pain.24\r\n[L1991] When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\n[L1992] that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\n[L1993] placebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\n[L1994] treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\n[L1995] enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\n[L1996] place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\n[L1997] The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\n[L1998] their hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\n[L1999] beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\n[L2000] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L2001] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L2002] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L2003] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L2004] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L2005] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L2006] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L2007] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L2008] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L2009] Placebo effect","[L2010] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2011] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>","[L2012] 244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2013] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L2014] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L2015] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L2016] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L2017] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L2018] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L2019] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L2020] the response variable do know.\r\n[L2021] Single-blind\r\n[L2022] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L2023] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L2024] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L2025] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L2026] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L2027] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L2028] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L2029] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\n[L2030] received the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n[L2031] 1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n[L2032] 2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n[L2033] 3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L2034] experiment.\r\n[L2035] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L2036] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L2037] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L2038] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L2039] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L2040] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L2041] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L2042] significant.\r\n[L2043] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L2044] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L2045] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L2046] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L2047] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation. A statistically sig\ufffenificant association in data from a well-designed experiment does imply causation.","[L2048] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b86211c359fd2c0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_39.jpg","size_bytes":53857,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2049] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 41 / 75>","[L2050] Section 4.2 Experiments 245\r\n[L2051] ACTIVITY Distracted driving\r\n[L2052] MATERIALS: Deck of cards for each team of 3 to 4 students\r\n[L2053] Is talking on a cell phone while driving more distracting than talking to \r\n[L2054] a passenger? David Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah \r\n[L2055] designed an experiment to help answer this question. They used 48 un\ufffedergraduate students as subjects. The researchers randomly assigned half \r\n[L2056] of the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\n[L2057] the other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger. One \r\n[L2058] response variable was whether the driver stopped at a rest area that was \r\n[L2059] specified by researchers before the simulation started.

We need 48 cards from the deck to represent the drivers in this study. In the \r\n[L2069] original experiment, 33 drivers stopped at the rest area and 15 didn\u2019t. Since \r\n[L2070] we\u2019re assuming that the treatment received won\u2019t change whether each driver \r\n[L2071] stops at the rest area, we use 33 cards to represent drivers who stop and 15 cards \r\n[L2072] to represent those who don\u2019t.

Let\u2019s return \r\n[L2104] to the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\n[L2105] one group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L2106] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L2107] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L2108] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L2109] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L2110] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L2111] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L2112] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L2113] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L2114] response to the treatments.\r\n[L2115] Blocking\r\n[L2116] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L2117] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L2118] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L2119] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L2120] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

How \r\n[L2132] should researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water? They could \r\n[L2133] use a completely randomized design and hope that the \r\n[L2134] random assignment distributes the light-colored clothing \r\n[L2135] about evenly between the cold- and warm-water treatment \r\n[L2136] groups.

The idea is to create blocks by matching pairs of similar \r\n[L2262] experimental units. Then we can use chance to decide which member of a pair \r\n[L2263] gets the first treatment. The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L2264] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L2265] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L2266] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L2267] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L2268] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L2269] Matched pairs design\r\n[L2270] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L2271] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L2272] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L2273] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L2274] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L2275] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L2276] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L2277] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L2278] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L2279] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L2280] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L2281] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L2282] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L2283] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L2284] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L2285] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates?

We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\n[L2312] EXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\n[L2313] Design determines analysis\r\n[L2314] A Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\n[L2315] randomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\n[L2316] standing group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n[L2317] 68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\n[L2318] higher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\n[L2319] pulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\n[L2320] graph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\n[L2321] standing pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\n[L2322] What about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\n[L2323] Fathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\n[L2324] rates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\n[L2325] difference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n[L2326] 24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\n[L2327] standing pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\n[L2328] evidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\n[L2329] Let\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\n[L2330] that we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\n[L2331] experimental designs. Blocking by subject in the matched pairs design greatly \r\n[L2332] reduced the variability in the response variable. That made it easier to detect \r\n[L2333] the fact that standing causes an increase in pulse rate. With the large amount \r\n[L2334] of variability in the completely randomized design, we were unable to draw \r\n[L2335] such a conclusion.","[L2336] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5c9678406de9a79#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_45.jpg","size_bytes":52515,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2337] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 47 / 75>","[L2338] Section 4.2 Experiments 251\r\n[L2339] Another important lesson to take away from the example is this: the design of the \r\n[L2340] study determines the appropriate method of analysis. For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\n[L2341] dotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\n[L2342] compare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\n[L2343] The following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\n[L2344] analyzing data from an experiment.\r\n[L2345] DATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\n[L2346] Most automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n[L2347] 78% nitrogen. Aircraft tires are filled with pure nitrogen, which is safer than air \r\n[L2348] in case of fire. Could filling automobile tires with nitrogen improve safety, perfor\ufffemance, or both?\r\n[L2349] Consumers Union designed a study to test whether nitrogen-filled tires would \r\n[L2350] maintain pressure better than air-filled tires. They obtained two tires from each of \r\n[L2351] several brands and then filled one tire in each pair with air and one with nitrogen. \r\n[L2352] All tires were inflated to a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch and then placed \r\n[L2353] outside for a year. At the end of the year, Consumers Union measured the pres\ufffesure in each tire. The amount of pressure lost (in pounds per square inch) during \r\n[L2354] the year for the air-filled and nitrogen-filled tires of each brand is shown in the \r\n[L2355] table below.29\r\n[L2356] Brand Air Nitrogen Brand Air Nitrogen\r\n[L2357] BF Goodrich Traction T/A HR 7.6 7.2 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 4.4 4.2\r\n[L2358] Bridgestone HP50 (Sears) 3.8 2.5 Sumitomo HTR H4 1.4 2.1\r\n[L2359] Bridgestone Potenza G009 3.7 1.6 Yokohama Avid H4S 4.3 3.0\r\n[L2360] Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.7 1.5 BF Goodrich Traction T/A V 5.5 3.4\r\n[L2361] Bridgestone Potenza EL400 2.1 1.0 Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.1 2.8\r\n[L2362] Continental Premier Contact H 4.9 3.1 Continental ContiExtreme Contact 5.0 3.4\r\n[L2363] Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 5.2 3.5 Continental ContiProContact 4.8 3.3\r\n[L2364] Dayton Daytona HR 3.4 3.2 Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 3.2 2.5\r\n[L2365] Falken Ziex ZE-512 4.1 3.3 General Exclaim UHP 6.8 2.7\r\n[L2366] Fuzion Hrl 2.7 2.2 Hankook Ventus V4 H105 3.1 1.4\r\n[L2367] General Exclaim 3.1 3.4 Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.5 1.5\r\n[L2368] Goodyear Assurance Tripletred 3.8 3.2 Michelin Pilot Exalto A/S 6.6 2.2\r\n[L2369] Hankook Optimo H418 3.0 0.9 Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 2.2 2.0\r\n[L2370] Kumho Solus KH16 6.2 3.4 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 2.5 2.7\r\n[L2371] Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.0 1.8 Sumitomo HTR+ 4.4 3.7\r\n[L2372] Michelin Pilot XGT H4 1.1 0.7\r\n[L2373] Does filling tires with nitrogen instead of compressed air reduce pressure loss? \r\n[L2374] Give appropriate graphical and numerical evidence to support your answer.","[L2375] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>","[L2376] 252 CHAPTER CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2377] s We can produce data intended to answer specific questions by observational\r\n[L2378] studies or experiments. An observational study gathers data on individuals \r\n[L2379] as they are. Experiments actively do something to people, animals, or \r\n[L2380] objects in order to measure their response.\r\n[L2381] s Statistical studies often try to show that changing one variable (the \r\n[L2382] explanatory variable) causes changes in another variable (the response\r\n[L2383] variable). Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\n[L2384] be distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\n[L2385] experiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\n[L2386] actually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\n[L2387] variable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\n[L2388] s In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\n[L2389] is a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\n[L2390] s The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\n[L2391] manner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\n[L2392] principles of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\n[L2393] assignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\n[L2394] s The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\n[L2395] two or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\n[L2396] with other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\n[L2397] s Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\n[L2398] Random assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\n[L2399] chance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\n[L2400] comparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\n[L2401] s Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\n[L2402] reduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\n[L2403] likely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\n[L2404] s Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\n[L2405] neither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\n[L2406] responses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\n[L2407] the other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\n[L2408] s Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\n[L2409] That helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\n[L2410] patients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\n[L2411] they have received an inactive treatment.\r\n[L2412] s In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\n[L2413] individuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\n[L2414] Randomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\n[L2415] helps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\n[L2416] s Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\n[L2417] treatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\n[L2418] treatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\n[L2419] closely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\n[L2420] Summary SECTION 4.2","[L2421] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","[L2423] Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n[L2424] 45.

Researchers began by \r\n[L2428] asking 305 healthy pregnant women to report their \r\n[L2429] chocolate consumption. Six months after birth, the \r\n[L2430] researchers asked mothers to rate their infants\u2019 tem\ufffeperament, including smiling, laughter, and fear.

Learning biology with computers An educator wants \r\n[L2452] to compare the effectiveness of computer software for \r\n[L2453] teaching biology with that of a textbook presentation. \r\n[L2454] She gives a biology pretest to each of a group of high \r\n[L2455] school juniors, then randomly divides them into \r\n[L2456] two groups. One group uses the computer, and the \r\n[L2457] other studies the text.

Cell phones and brain cancer One study of cell \r\n[L2467] phones and the risk of brain cancer looked at a group \r\n[L2468] of 469 people who have brain cancer. The investiga\ufffetors matched each cancer patient with a person of \r\n[L2469] the same age, gender, and race who did not have \r\n[L2470] brain cancer, then asked about the use of cell phones. \r\n[L2471] Result: \u201cOur data suggest that the use of handheld \r\n[L2472] cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain \r\n[L2473] cancer.\u201d32\r\n[L2474] (a) Is this an observational study or an experiment? \r\n[L2475] Justify your answer.\r\n[L2476] (b) Based on this study, would you conclude that cell \r\n[L2477] phones do not increase the risk of brain cancer?

Effects of class size Do smaller classes in elementary \r\n[L2480] school really benefit students in areas such as scores \r\n[L2481] on standardized tests, staying in school, and going on \r\n[L2482] to college? We might do an observational study that \r\n[L2483] compares students who happened to be in smaller \r\n[L2484] and larger classes in their early school years. Identify \r\n[L2485] a lurking variable that may lead to confounding with \r\n[L2486] the effects of small classes. Explain how confounding \r\n[L2487] might occur.\r\n[L2488] 50. Effects of binge drinking A common definition of \r\n[L2489] \u201cbinge drinking\u201d is 5 or more drinks at one sitting for \r\n[L2490] men and 4 or more for women. An observational study \r\n[L2491] finds that students who binge drink have lower average \r\n[L2492] GPA than those who don\u2019t. Identify a lurking variable \r\n[L2493] that may be confounded with the effects of binge \r\n[L2494] drinking.

Improving response rate How can we reduce the \r\n[L2521] rate of refusals in telephone surveys? Most people \r\n[L2522] who answer at all listen to the interviewer\u2019s introduc\ufffetory remarks and then decide whether to continue. \r\n[L2523] One study made telephone calls to randomly selected \r\n[L2524] households to ask opinions about the next election. In \r\n[L2525] some calls, the interviewer gave her name, in others \r\n[L2526] she identified the university she was representing, \r\n[L2527] and in still others she identified both herself and the \r\n[L2528] university. For each type of call, the interviewer either \r\n[L2529] did or did not offer to send a copy of the final survey \r\n[L2530] results to the person interviewed. Do these differences \r\n[L2531] in the introduction affect whether the interview is \r\n[L2532] completed?\r\n[L2533] 54. Eat well and exercise Most American adolescents \r\n[L2534] don\u2019t eat well and don\u2019t exercise enough. Can middle \r\n[L2535] schools increase physical activity among \r\n[L2536] their students? Can they persuade students to eat \r\n[L2537] better? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\n[L2538] intervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\n[L2539] school day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\n[L2540] for healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\n[L2541] school was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention. The \r\n[L2542] investigators observed physical activity and lunchtime \r\n[L2543] consumption of fat.\r\n[L2544] 55. Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\n[L2545] will use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\n[L2546] raise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\n[L2547] either 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n[L2548] 150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\n[L2549] combinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\n[L2550] fabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\n[L2551] for quality.\r\n[L2552] 56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\n[L2553] the increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\n[L2554] they stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\n[L2555] beat of a metronome. The step was either 5.75 or 11.5 \r\n[L2556] inches high and the metronome beat was 14, 21, or \r\n[L2557] 28 steps per minute. Five students stepped at each \r\n[L2558] combination of height and speed.\r\n[L2559] 57. Cocoa and blood flow A study conducted by Nor\ufffeman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham \r\n[L2560] and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, \r\n[L2561] involved 27 healthy people aged 18 to 72. Each \r\n[L2562] subject consumed a cocoa beverage containing 900 \r\n[L2563] milligrams of flavonols (a class of flavonoids) daily \r\n[L2564] for five days. Using a finger cuff, blood flow was mea\ufffesured on the first and fifth days of the study. After five \r\n[L2565] days, researchers measured what they called \u201csignifi\ufffecant improvement\u201d in blood flow and the function of \r\n[L2566] the cells that line the blood vessels.33 What flaw in the \r\n[L2567] design of this experiment makes it impossible to say \r\n[L2568] whether the cocoa really caused the improved blood \r\n[L2569] flow? Explain.\r\n[L2570] 58. Reducing unemployment Will cash bonuses speed \r\n[L2571] the return to work of unemployed people? A state \r\n[L2572] department of labor notes that last year 68% of people \r\n[L2573] who filed claims for unemployment insurance found \r\n[L2574] a new job within 15 weeks. As an experiment, this year \r\n[L2575] the state offers $500 to people filing unemployment \r\n[L2576] claims if they find a job within 15 weeks. The percent \r\n[L2577] who do so increases to 77%. What flaw in the design \r\n[L2578] of this experiment makes it impossible to say whether \r\n[L2579] the bonus really caused the increase? Explain.\r\n[L2580] 59.

Then carry out \r\n[L2632] your random assignment.\r\n[L2633] 62. More rain for California? The changing climate will \r\n[L2634] probably bring more rain to California, but we don\u2019t \r\n[L2635] know whether the additional rain will come during the \r\n[L2636] winter wet season or extend into the long dry season in \r\n[L2637] spring and summer. Kenwyn Suttle of the University \r\n[L2638] of California at Berkeley and his coworkers carried \r\n[L2639] out an experiment to study the effects of more rain in \r\n[L2640] either season. They randomly assigned plots of open \r\n[L2641] grassland to 3 treatments: added water equal to 20% of \r\n[L2642] annual rainfall either during January to March (winter) \r\n[L2643] or during April to June (spring), and no added water \r\n[L2644] (control). Thirty-six circular plots of area 70 square me\ufffeters were available (see the photo), of which 18 were \r\n[L2645] used for this study. One response variable was total \r\n[L2646] plant biomass, in grams per square meter, produced in \r\n[L2647] a plot over a year.35\r\n[L2648] (a) Outline the design of the experiment. What is \r\n[L2649] this type of design called?\r\n[L2650] (b) Explain how you would randomly assign the \r\n[L2651] experimental units to the three treatments. Then \r\n[L2652] carry out your random assignment.\r\n[L2653] 63. Treating prostate disease A large study used records \r\n[L2654] from Canada\u2019s national health care system to com\ufffepare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate \r\n[L2655] disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery \r\n[L2656] and a new method that does not require surgery. The \r\n[L2657] records described many patients whose doctors had \r\n[L2658] chosen each method. The study found that patients \r\n[L2659] treated by the new method were significantly more \r\n[L2660] likely to die within 8 years.36\r\n[L2661] (a) Further study of the data showed that this conclu\ufffesion was wrong. The extra deaths among patients who \r\n[L2662] got the new method could be explained by lurking vari\ufffeables. What lurking variables might be confounded with \r\n[L2663] a doctor\u2019s choice of surgical or nonsurgical treatment?\r\n[L2664] (b) You have 300 prostate patients who are willing to \r\n[L2665] serve as subjects in an experiment to compare the two \r\n[L2666] methods. Write a few sentences describing how you \r\n[L2667] would design this experiment.\r\n[L2668] 64. Getting teachers to come to school Elementary \r\n[L2669] schools in rural India are usually small, with a single \r\n[L2670] teacher. The teachers often fail to show up for work. \r\n[L2671] Here is an idea for improving attendance: give the \r\n[L2672] teacher a digital camera with a tamperproof time \r\n[L2673] and date stamp and ask a student to take a photo of \r\n[L2674] the teacher and class at the beginning and end of the \r\n[L2675] day. Offer the teacher better pay for good attendance, \r\n[L2676] verified by the photos. Will this work? Researchers \r\n[L2677] obtained permission to use 120 rural schools in \r\n[L2678] Rajasthan for an experiment to find out.37\r\n[L2679] (a) Explain why it would not be a good idea to offer \r\n[L2680] better pay for good attendance to the teachers in all \r\n[L2681] 120 schools and then to compare this year\u2019s atten\ufffedance with last year\u2019s.\r\n[L2682] (b) Write a few sentences describing how you would \r\n[L2683] design this experiment.\r\n[L2684] 65. Stronger players A football coach hears that a new \r\n[L2685] exercise program will increase upper-body strength \r\n[L2686] better than lifting weights. He is eager to test this new \r\n[L2687] program in the off-season with the players on his high \r\n[L2688] school team. The coach decides to let his players \r\n[L2689] choose which of the two treatments they will undergo \r\n[L2690] for 3 weeks\u2014exercise or weight lifting. He will use \r\n[L2691] the number of push-ups a player can do at the end of \r\n[L2692] the experiment as the response variable.\r\n[L2693] (a) Which principle of experimental design does the \r\n[L2694] coach\u2019s plan violate? Explain how this violation could \r\n[L2695] lead to confounding.\r\n[L2696] (b) Comment on the coach\u2019s choice of response \r\n[L2697] variable.\r\n[L2698] 66. Prayer and meditation You read in a magazine \r\n[L2699] that \u201cnonphysical treatments such as meditation and \r\n[L2700] prayer have been shown to be effective in controlled \r\n[L2701] scientific studies for such ailments as high blood \r\n[L2702] pg 239","[L2703] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 51 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://108fc5c94b0996f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_50.jpg","size_bytes":71434,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2704] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 52 / 75>","[L2705] 256 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2706] pressure, insomnia, ulcers, and asthma.\u201d Explain \r\n[L2707] in simple language what the article means by \r\n[L2708] \u201ccontrolled scientific studies.\u201d Why can such studies \r\n[L2709] provide good evidence that meditation is an effective \r\n[L2710] treatment for high blood pressure?\r\n[L2711] 67. The effects of day care Does day care help low\ufffeincome children stay in school and hold good jobs \r\n[L2712] later in life? The Carolina Abecedarian Project (the \r\n[L2713] name suggests the ABCs) has followed a group of \r\n[L2714] 111 children since 1972. Back then, these individu\ufffeals were all healthy but low-income black infants in \r\n[L2715] Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All the infants received \r\n[L2716] nutritional supplements and help from social workers. \r\n[L2717] Half were also assigned at random to an intensive \r\n[L2718] preschool program.38\r\n[L2719] (a) Explain the purpose of each of the three experi\ufffemental design principles.\r\n[L2720] (b) Describe how each of these principles was used \r\n[L2721] in this study.\r\n[L2722] 68. Killing weeds A biologist would like to determine \r\n[L2723] which of two brands of weed killer is less likely to \r\n[L2724] harm the plants in a garden at the university. Before \r\n[L2725] spraying near the plants, the biologist decides to \r\n[L2726] conduct an experiment using 24 individual plants. \r\n[L2727] Which of the following two plans for randomly \r\n[L2728] assigning the treatments should the biologist use? \r\n[L2729] Why?\r\n[L2730] Plan A: Choose the 12 healthiest-looking plants. \r\n[L2731] Apply Brand X weed killer to all 12 of those plants. \r\n[L2732] Apply Brand Y weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2733] Plan B: Choose 12 of the 24 plants at random. Apply \r\n[L2734] Brand X weed killer to those 12 plants and Brand Y \r\n[L2735] weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2736] 69. Do placebos really work? Researchers in Japan \r\n[L2737] conducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\n[L2738] were extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\n[L2739] each subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\n[L2740] told the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\n[L2741] subject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\n[L2742] was poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\n[L2743] the arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n[L2744] 13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\n[L2745] poison ivy leaf.39\r\n[L2746] (a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n[L2747] (b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\n[L2748] idea of a placebo effect.\r\n[L2749] 70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\n[L2750] chronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\n[L2751] and needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\n[L2752] will be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\n[L2753] percent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n[L2754] (a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\n[L2755] drug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n[L2756] (b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\n[L2757] getting the new drug or a placebo? How would this \r\n[L2758] knowledge probably affect their reactions?\r\n[L2759] 71. Meditation for anxiety An experiment that claimed \r\n[L2760] to show that meditation lowers anxiety proceeded as \r\n[L2761] follows. The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\n[L2762] and rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\n[L2763] were randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\n[L2764] meditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\n[L2765] simply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\n[L2766] the experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\n[L2767] and rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\n[L2768] now had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\n[L2769] Explain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\n[L2770] could bias the reported results.\r\n[L2771] 72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\n[L2772] testosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\n[L2773] cause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\n[L2774] fat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\n[L2775] supplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\n[L2776] in the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\n[L2777] with low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\n[L2778] a testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\n[L2779] in the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\n[L2780] described the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\n[L2781] placebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\n[L2782] terms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n[L2783] 73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\n[L2784] determine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\n[L2785] acupuncture could help infertile women become \r\n[L2786] pregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\n[L2787] undergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\n[L2788] were recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\n[L2789] randomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n[L2790] 25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\n[L2791] minutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\n[L2792] were instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\n[L2793] embryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n[L2794] 34 women became pregnant. In the control group, \r\n[L2795] 21 women became pregnant.\r\n[L2796] (a) Describe how the three principles of experimen\ufffetal design were addressed in this study.\r\n[L2797] (b) The difference in the percent of women who \r\n[L2798] became pregnant in the two groups is statistically \r\n[L2799] significant. Explain what this means to someone who \r\n[L2800] knows little statistics.\r\n[L2801] (c) Explain why the placebo effect prevents us from \r\n[L2802] concluding that acupuncture caused the difference in \r\n[L2803] pregnancy rates.\r\n[L2804] pg 241","[L2805] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>","[L2806] Section 4.2 Experiments 257\r\n[L2807] 74. Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\n[L2808] colleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\n[L2809] Half of the participants were randomly assigned \r\n[L2810] to a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\n[L2811] assigned to a low-fat diet. Researchers measured each \r\n[L2812] participant\u2019s change in weight and cholesterol level \r\n[L2813] after six months and again after one year. Subjects in \r\n[L2814] the low-carb diet group lost significantly more weight \r\n[L2815] than subjects in the low-fat diet group during the first \r\n[L2816] six months of the study. At the end of a year, however, \r\n[L2817] the average weight loss for subjects in the two groups \r\n[L2818] was not significantly different.42\r\n[L2819] (a) Why did researchers randomly assign the subjects \r\n[L2820] to the diet treatments?\r\n[L2821] (b) Explain to someone who knows little statistics \r\n[L2822] what \u201clost significantly more weight\u201d means.\r\n[L2823] (c) The subjects in the low-carb diet group lost an aver\ufffeage of 5.1 kg in a year. The subjects in the low-fat diet \r\n[L2824] group lost an average of 3.1 kg. Explain how this infor\ufffemation could be consistent with the fact that weight loss \r\n[L2825] in the two groups was not significantly different.\r\n[L2826] 75. Is yawning contagious? According to the popular \r\n[L2827] TV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\n[L2828] March 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\n[L2829] presented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\n[L2830] subjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\n[L2831] an extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\n[L2832] camera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\n[L2833] seed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\n[L2834] yawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\n[L2835] who had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\n[L2836] given a yawn seed, 10 yawned. Adam Savage and Ja\ufffemie Hyneman, the cohosts of Mythbusters, used these \r\n[L2837] results to conclude that yawning is contagious.\r\n[L2838] (a) Explain how you could use slips of paper to ran\ufffedomly reassign the subjects to the treatment groups.\r\n[L2839] (b) Suppose we used your method in (a) to redo the \r\n[L2840] random assignment 50 times.

The researchers decided to \r\n[L2846] analyze the patients\u2019 final pain ratings. It also makes \r\n[L2847] sense to examine the difference between patients\u2019 \r\n[L2848] initial pain ratings and their final pain ratings in both \r\n[L2849] groups.

A nutrition experimenter intends to \r\n[L2934] compare the weight gain of newly weaned male \r\n[L2935] rats fed Diet A with that of rats fed Diet B. To do this, \r\n[L2936] she will feed each diet to 10 rats. She has available \r\n[L2937] 10 rats from one litter and 10 rats from a second \r\n[L2938] litter. Rats in the first litter appear to be slightly \r\n[L2939] healthier.\r\n[L2940] (a) If the 10 rats from Litter 1 were fed Diet A, the \r\n[L2941] effects of genetics and diet would be confounded, and \r\n[L2942] the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A. \r\n[L2943] Explain this statement carefully.\r\n[L2944] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2945] 82. Technology for teaching statistics The Brigham \r\n[L2946] Young University (BYU) statistics department is \r\n[L2947] performing experiments to compare teaching meth\ufffeods. Response variables include students\u2019 final-exam \r\n[L2948] scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. \r\n[L2949] One study compares two levels of technology for large \r\n[L2950] lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) \r\n[L2951] and multimedia. There are 8 lecture sections of a \r\n[L2952] basic statistics course at BYU, each with about 200 \r\n[L2953] students. There are four instructors, each of whom \r\n[L2954] teaches two sections.44 Suppose the sections and \r\n[L2955] lecturers are as follows:\r\n[L2956] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2957] 1 Hilton\r\n[L2958] 2 Christensen\r\n[L2959] 3 Hadfield\r\n[L2960] 4 Hadfield\r\n[L2961] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2962] 5 Tolley\r\n[L2963] 6 Hilton\r\n[L2964] 7 Tolley\r\n[L2965] 8 Christensen\r\n[L2966] (a) Suppose we randomly assign two lecturers to use \r\n[L2967] standard technology in their sections and the other \r\n[L2968] two lecturers to use multimedia technology. Explain \r\n[L2969] how this could lead to confounding.\r\n[L2970] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2971] 83. Look, Ma, no hands! Does talking on a hands-free \r\n[L2972] cell phone distract drivers? Researchers recruit 40 \r\n[L2973] student subjects for an experiment to investigate \r\n[L2974] this question. They have a driving simulator \r\n[L2975] equipped with a hands-free phone for use in the \r\n[L2976] study.\r\n[L2977] (a) Researchers are considering the design shown in \r\n[L2978] the figure below.

Chocolate gets my heart pumping Cardiologists \r\n[L3000] at Athens Medical School in Greece wanted to test \r\n[L3001] whether chocolate affected blood flow in the blood \r\n[L3002] vessels. The researchers recruited 17 healthy young \r\n[L3003] volunteers, who were each given a 3.5-ounce bar of \r\n[L3004] dark chocolate, either bittersweet or fake chocolate. \r\n[L3005] On another day, the volunteers were switched. The \r\n[L3006] subjects had no chocolate outside the study, and \r\n[L3007] investigators didn\u2019t know whether a subject had eaten \r\n[L3008] the real or the fake chocolate. An ultrasound was \r\n[L3009] taken of each volunteer\u2019s upper arm to see the func\ufffetioning of the cells in the walls of the main artery. \r\n[L3010] The investigators found that blood vessel function was \r\n[L3011] improved when the subjects ate bittersweet chocolate, \r\n[L3012] and that there were no such changes when they ate \r\n[L3013] the placebo (fake chocolate).45\r\n[L3014] (a) What type of design did the investigators use in \r\n[L3015] their study?\r\n[L3016] (b) Explain why the investigators chose this design \r\n[L3017] instead of a completely randomized design.\r\n[L3018] (c) Why is it important to randomly assign the order \r\n[L3019] of the treatments for the subjects?\r\n[L3020] 85. Room temperature and dexterity An expert on \r\n[L3021] worker performance is interested in the effect of \r\n[L3022] room temperature on the performance of tasks \r\n[L3023] requiring manual dexterity. She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\n[L3024] variable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\n[L3025] a 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\n[L3026] requires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\n[L3027] subject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\n[L3028] make as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\n[L3029] continuous effort.\r\n[L3030] (a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\n[L3031] compare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\n[L3032] available.\r\n[L3033] (b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\n[L3034] wide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\n[L3035] subjects in each group. Describe in detail the design \r\n[L3036] of a matched pairs experiment in which each subject \r\n[L3037] serves as his or her own control.\r\n[L3038] 86. Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\n[L3039] of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\n[L3040] increasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\n[L3041] Because plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\n[L3042] CO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\n[L3043] An elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\n[L3044] CO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\n[L3045] the growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\n[L3046] untreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\n[L3047] growth. We can afford to treat three circular areas.46\r\n[L3048] (a) Describe the design of a completely randomized \r\n[L3049] experiment using 6 well-separated 30-meter circular \r\n[L3050] areas in a pine forest.

Sketch the circles and carry out the \r\n[L3056] randomization your design calls for.\r\n[L3057] 87. Got deodorant? A group of students wants to per\ufffeform an experiment to determine whether Brand A or \r\n[L3058] Brand B deodorant lasts longer. One group member \r\n[L3059] suggests the following design: Recruit 40 student \r\n[L3060] volunteers\u201420 male and 20 female. Separate by \r\n[L3061] gender, since male and female bodies might respond \r\n[L3062] differently to deodorant. Give all the males Brand A \r\n[L3063] deodorant and all the females Brand B. Have each \r\n[L3064] student rate how well the deodorant is still working \r\n[L3065] at the end of the school day on a 0 to 10 scale. Then \r\n[L3066] compare ratings for the two treatments.\r\n[L3067] (a) Identify any flaws you see in the proposed design \r\n[L3068] for this experiment.\r\n[L3069] (b) Describe how you would design the experiment. \r\n[L3070] Explain how your design addresses each of the \r\n[L3071] problems you identified in (a).\r\n[L3072] 88.

Justin \r\n[L3074] decides to conduct his own experiment to find out. \r\n[L3075] On Friday and Saturday nights, he doesn\u2019t set the \r\n[L3076] alarm before going to bed. On Monday and Tuesday, \r\n[L3077] he sets the alarm for 7 a.m. Justin records the time \r\n[L3078] when he wakes up each day and then compares his \r\n[L3079] average wake-up time with and without the alarm.\r\n[L3080] (a) Identify any flaws you see in the proposed design \r\n[L3081] for this experiment.\r\n[L3082] (b) Describe how you would design the experiment. \r\n[L3083] Explain how your design addresses each of the prob\ufffelems you identified in (a).\r\n[L3084] 89.

Can changing diet reduce high blood pressure? \r\n[L3098] Vegetarian diets and low-salt diets are both promising. \r\n[L3099] Men with high blood pressure are assigned at random \r\n[L3100] to four diets: (1) normal diet with unrestricted salt; \r\n[L3101] (2) vegetarian with unrestricted salt; (3) normal with \r\n[L3102] restricted salt; and (4) vegetarian with restricted salt. \r\n[L3103] This experiment has\r\n[L3104] (a) one factor, the type of diet.\r\n[L3105] (b) two factors, high blood pressure and type of diet.\r\n[L3106] (c) two factors, normal/vegetarian diet and unre\ufffestricted/restricted salt.\r\n[L3107] (d) three factors, men, high blood pressure, and type \r\n[L3108] of diet.\r\n[L3109] (e) four factors, the four diets being compared.\r\n[L3110] 92.

The Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Ces\ufffesation asked whether a community-wide advertising \r\n[L3119] campaign would reduce smoking.

One com\ufffemunity in each pair participated in the advertising \r\n[L3122] campaign and the other did not.

Is this \r\n[L3152] good evidence that ibuprofen is effective in prevent\ufffeing Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\r\n[L3153] (a) Yes, because the study was a randomized, \r\n[L3154] comparative experiment.\r\n[L3155] (b) No, because the effect of ibuprofen is confounded \r\n[L3156] with the placebo effect.\r\n[L3157] (c) Yes, because the results were published in a \r\n[L3158] reputable professional journal.\r\n[L3159] (d) No, because this is an observational study.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L3219] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L3220] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L3221] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L3222] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L3223] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L3224] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3225] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L3226] on the design of the study.\r\n[L3227] Scope of Inference\r\n[L3228] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L3229] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L3230] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L3231] results of the sample.\r\n[L3232] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L3233] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L3234] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L3235] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L3236] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L3237] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L3238] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L3239] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L3240] 4.3\r\n[L3241] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","[L3242] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3243] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","[L3244] 262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3245] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L3246] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L3247] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L3248] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L3249] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L3250] Yes No\r\n[L3251] Were individuals \r\n[L3252] randomly selected?\r\n[L3253] Yes\r\n[L3254] Inference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\n[L3255] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3256] No Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\n[L3257] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3258] Well-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\n[L3259] However, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\n[L3260] larger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\n[L3261] effect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\n[L3262] rules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\n[L3263] random sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\n[L3264] example illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\n[L3265] EXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\n[L3266] Determining scope of inference\r\n[L3267] A small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\n[L3268] The dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\n[L3269] Design 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3270] to take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L3271] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L3272] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L3273] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L3274] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3275] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L3276] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3277] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3278] part in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3279] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3280] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L3281] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3282] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L3283] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L3284] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L3285] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L3286] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L3287] SOLUTION:\r\n[L3288] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L3289] holds for a larger population of dental patients.

However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L3299] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L3300] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L3301] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L3302] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L3303] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L3304] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L3305] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L3306] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L3307] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L3308] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L3309] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L3310] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L3311] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L3312] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L3313] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L3314] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L3315] the town.\r\n[L3316] The Challenges of \r\n[L3317] Establishing Causation\r\n[L3318] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L3319] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L3320] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L3321] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L3322] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L3323] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L3324] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\n[L3325] Lack of realism\r\n[L3326] Do those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3327] since 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\n[L3328] showed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\n[L3329] But requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\n[L3330] What happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\n[L3331] all cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\n[L3332] For Practice Try Exercise 105","[L3333] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3334] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","[L3335] 264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3336] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3337] In some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\n[L3338] these important questions:\r\n[L3339] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L3340] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L3341] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L3342] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L3343] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L3344] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L3345] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L3346] studies.\r\n[L3347] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L3348] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L3349] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L3350] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L3351] Living with observational studies\r\n[L3352] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L3353] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L3354] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L3355] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L3356] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L3357] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L3358] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L3359] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L3360] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L3361] experiment?\r\n[L3362] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L3363] very strong.\r\n[L3364] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L3365] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L3366] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L3367] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L3368] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L3369] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L3370] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L3371] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L3372] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L3373] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L3374] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L3375] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L3376] cancer death among women.","[L3377] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3378] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","[L3379] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L3380] sThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\n[L3381] cigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\n[L3382] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L3383] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3384] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L3385] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L3386] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L3387] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\n[L3388] observational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\n[L3389] Data Ethics*\r\n[L3390] Medical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\n[L3391] Shouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\n[L3392] reasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L3393] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L3394] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L3395] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L3396] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L3397] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L3398] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L3399] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L3400] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L3401] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L3402] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L3403] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\n[L3404] knows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\n[L3405] the physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\n[L3406] sWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L3407] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L3408] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L3409] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L3410] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L3411] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\n[L3412] are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\n[L3413] data from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\n[L3414] Basic Data Ethics\r\n[L3415] All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\n[L3416] board charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\n[L3417] All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\n[L3418] before data are collected.\r\n[L3419] All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\n[L3420] groups of subjects may be made public.\r\n[L3421] *This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","[L3422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","[L3423] 266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3424] The law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\n[L3425] obey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\n[L3426] Institutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\n[L3427] to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\n[L3428] it is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\n[L3429] board, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\n[L3430] recruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\n[L3431] study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\n[L3432] are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\n[L3433] research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\n[L3434] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L3435] boards.\r\n[L3436] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L3437] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L3438] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L3439] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L3440] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L3441] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L3442] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L3443] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L3444] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L3445] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L3446] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L3447] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L3448] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L3449] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L3450] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity.

The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L3456] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L3457] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L3458] other identification have been removed from the data available for search.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L3496] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L3497] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L3498] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L3499] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L3500] results.\r\n[L3501] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L3502] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L3503] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L3504] lurking variables.\r\n[L3505] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L3506] review board.

Researchers carried \r\n[L3515] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L3516] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\n[L3517] dotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\n[L3518] magnet).\r\n[L3519] The average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\n[L3520] and 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\n[L3521] significant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\n[L3522] The difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\n[L3523] too large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain.

According to \r\n[L3558] Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain,\r\n[L3559] women say nearly three times as many words per day \r\n[L3560] as men. Skeptical researchers devised a study to test \r\n[L3561] this claim.

The psychologist observes the students \r\n[L3604] through a one-way window and notes the changes in \r\n[L3605] their behavior during an evening of game playing. \r\n[L3606] Can the psychologist generalize the results of her \r\n[L3607] study to a team of employees that spends months \r\n[L3608] developing a new product that never works right and \r\n[L3609] is finally abandoned by their company? Explain.\r\n[L3610] 109.* Minimal risk? You have been invited to serve on \r\n[L3611] a college\u2019s institutional review board. You must \r\n[L3612] decide whether several research proposals qualify for \r\n[L3613] lighter review because they involve only minimal \r\n[L3614] risk to subjects. Federal regulations say that \u201cminimal \r\n[L3615] risk\u201d means the risks are no greater than \u201cthose \r\n[L3616] ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the \r\n[L3617] performance of routine physical or psychological \r\n[L3618] examinations or tests.\u201d That\u2019s vague. Which of these \r\n[L3619] do you think qualifies as \u201cminimal risk\u201d?\r\n[L3620] *Exercises 109 to 116: This is an important topic, but it is not \r\n[L3621] required for the AP Statistics exam.\r\n[L3622] pg 262\r\n[L3623] SECTION 4.3 Exercises","[L3624] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 66 / 75>","[L3625] 270 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3626] (a) Draw a drop of blood by pricking a finger to \r\n[L3627] measure blood sugar.\r\n[L3628] (b) Draw blood from the arm for a full set of blood tests.\r\n[L3629] (c) Insert a tube that remains in the arm, so that \r\n[L3630] blood can be drawn regularly.\r\n[L3631] 110.*Who reviews? Government regulations require that \r\n[L3632] institutional review boards consist of at least five people, \r\n[L3633] including at least one scientist, one nonscientist, and \r\n[L3634] one person from outside the institution. Most boards \r\n[L3635] are larger, but many contain just one outsider.\r\n[L3636] (a) Why should review boards contain people who \r\n[L3637] are not scientists?\r\n[L3638] (b) Do you think that one outside member is \r\n[L3639] enough?

One of the most impor\ufffetant nongovernment surveys in the United States is the \r\n[L3664] National Opinion Research Center\u2019s General Social \r\n[L3665] Survey. The GSS regularly monitors public opinion \r\n[L3666] on a wide variety of political and social issues. Inter\ufffeviews are conducted in person in the subject\u2019s home. \r\n[L3667] Are a subject\u2019s responses to GSS questions anonymous, \r\n[L3668] confidential, or both?

Does this describe the \r\n[L3679] anonymous or the confidential screening? Why?\r\n[L3680] 115.* The Willowbrook hepatitis studies In the 1960s, \r\n[L3681] children entering the Willowbrook State School, an \r\n[L3682] institution for the mentally retarded, were \r\n[L3683] deliberately infected with hepatitis. The researchers \r\n[L3684] argued that almost all children in the institution \r\n[L3685] quickly became infected anyway. The studies \r\n[L3686] showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis \r\n[L3687] existed. This finding contributed to the development \r\n[L3688] of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, \r\n[L3689] the Willowbrook studies are now considered an \r\n[L3690] example of unethical research. Explain why, \r\n[L3691] according to current ethical standards, useful results \r\n[L3692] are not enough to allow a study.\r\n[L3693] 116.* Unequal benefits Researchers on aging proposed to \r\n[L3694] investigate the effect of supplemental health services \r\n[L3695] on the quality of life of older people. Eligible \r\n[L3696] patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to \r\n[L3697] be randomly assigned to treatment and control \r\n[L3698] groups. The treatment group would be offered \r\n[L3699] hearing aids, dentures, transportation, and other \r\n[L3700] services not available without charge to the control \r\n[L3701] group. The review board felt that providing these \r\n[L3702] services to some but not other persons in the same \r\n[L3703] institution raised ethical questions. Do you agree?\r\n[L3704] 117. Animal testing (1.1) \u201cIt is right to use animals for \r\n[L3705] medical testing if it might save human lives.\u201d The \r\n[L3706] General Social Survey asked 1152 adults to react to this \r\n[L3707] statement.

Initial public offerings (1.3) The business \r\n[L3718] magazine Forbes reports that 4567 companies sold \r\n[L3719] their first stock to the public between 1990 and \r\n[L3720] 2000. The mean change in the stock price of these \r\n[L3721] companies since the first stock was issued was \r\n[L3722] +111%. The median change was \u221231%.58 Explain \r\n[L3723] how this could happen.

Ontario Health Survey The Ministry of Health in \r\n[L3757] the province of Ontario, Canada, wants to know whether \r\n[L3758] the national health care system is achieving its goals in the \r\n[L3759] province. Much information about health care comes from \r\n[L3760] patient records, but that source doesn\u2019t allow us to compare \r\n[L3761] people who use health services with those who don\u2019t. So \r\n[L3762] the Ministry of Health conducted the Ontario Health Sur\ufffevey, which interviewed a random sample of 61,239 people \r\n[L3763] who live in the province of Ontario.59\r\n[L3764] (a) What is the population for this sample survey? \r\n[L3765] What is the sample?\r\n[L3766] (b) The survey found that 76% of males and 86% of \r\n[L3767] females in the sample had visited a general practi\ufffetioner at least once in the past year.

Polling the faculty A researcher wants to study the \r\n[L3805] attitudes of college faculty members about the work hab\ufffeits of entering freshmen. These attitudes appear to differ \r\n[L3806] depending on the type of college. The American Associa\ufffetion of University Professors classifies colleges as follows:\r\n[L3807] Class I: Offer doctorate degrees and award at least 15 \r\n[L3808] per year.\r\n[L3809] Class IIA: Award degrees above the bachelor\u2019s but are \r\n[L3810] not in Class I.\r\n[L3811] Class IIB: Award no degrees beyond the bachelor\u2019s.\r\n[L3812] Class III: Two-year colleges.\r\n[L3813] The researcher would like to survey about 200 faculty mem\ufffebers.

Are anesthetics safe? The National Halothane Study \r\n[L3831] was a major investigation of the safety of anesthetics used \r\n[L3832] in surgery. Records of over 850,000 operations performed \r\n[L3833] in 34 major hospitals showed the following death rates for \r\n[L3834] four common anesthetics:60\r\n[L3835] Anesthetic: A B C D\r\n[L3836] Death rate: 1.7% 1.7% 3.4% 1.9%\r\n[L3837] There seems to be a clear association between the anesthet\ufffeic used and the death rate of patients. Anesthetic C appears\r\n[L3838] to be dangerous.\r\n[L3839] (a) Explain why we call the National Halothane Study \r\n[L3840] an observational study rather than an experiment,\r\n[L3841] even though it compared the results of using dif\ufffeferent anesthetics in actual surgery.\r\n[L3842] (b) When the study looked at lurking variables that \r\n[L3843] are related to a doctor\u2019s choice of anesthetic, it \r\n[L3844] found that Anesthetic C was not causing extra \r\n[L3845] deaths.

Ugly fries Few people want to eat discolored \r\n[L3851] french fries. Potatoes are kept refrigerated before being \r\n[L3852] cut for french fries to prevent spoiling and preserve flavor. \r\n[L3853] But immediate processing of cold potatoes causes discol\ufffeoring due to complex chemical reactions. The potatoes \r\n[L3854] must therefore be brought to room temperature before \r\n[L3855] processing. Researchers want to design an experiment in \r\n[L3856] which tasters will rate the color and flavor of french fries \r\n[L3857] prepared from several groups of potatoes. The potatoes \r\n[L3858] will be freshly picked or stored for a month at room tem\ufffeperature or stored for a month refrigerated. They will then \r\n[L3859] be sliced and cooked either immediately or after an hour \r\n[L3860] at room temperature.

A study of treatments for angina (pain due to low \r\n[L3970] blood supply to the heart) compared bypass surgery, angio\ufffeplasty, and use of drugs. The study looked at the medical \r\n[L3971] records of thousands of angina patients whose doctors had \r\n[L3972] chosen one of these treatments. It found that the average \r\n[L3973] survival time of patients given drugs was the highest.

Which of the follow\ufffeing statements about this situation is true?\r\n[L4087] (a) Since random sampling was used, we can feel confi\ufffedent that the percent of all American high school teachers \r\n[L4088] who would say they favor a national proficiency test is close \r\n[L4089] to 32%.\r\n[L4090] (b) We cannot trust these results, because the survey was \r\n[L4091] mailed. Only survey results from face-to-face interviews are \r\n[L4092] considered valid.\r\n[L4093] (c) Because over half of those who were mailed the survey \r\n[L4094] actually responded, we can feel pretty confident that the ac\ufffetual percent of all American high school teachers who would \r\n[L4095] say they favor a national proficiency test is close to 32%.\r\n[L4096] (d) The results of this survey may be affected by nonre\ufffesponse bias.\r\n[L4097] (e) The results of this survey cannot be trusted due to vol\ufffeuntary response bias.\r\n[L4098] Section II: Free Response Show all your work.

Here are the IQ scores of 10 randomly chosen \r\n[L4262] fifth-grade students:\r\n[L4263] 145 139 126 122 125 130 96 110 118 118\r\n[L4264] Which of the following statements about this data set is \r\n[L4265] not true?\r\n[L4266] (a) The student with an IQ of 96 is considered an outlier \r\n[L4267] by the 1.5 \u00d7 IQR rule.\r\n[L4268] (b) The five-number summary of the 10 IQ scores is 96, \r\n[L4269] 118, 123.5, 130, 145.\r\n[L4270] (c) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4271] mean of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be higher than \r\n[L4272] the mean of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4273] (d) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4274] standard deviation of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be \r\n[L4275] lower than the standard deviation of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4276] (e) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4277] IQR of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be lower than the \r\n[L4278] IQR of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4279] AP1.9. Before he goes to bed each night, Mr. Kleen pours \r\n[L4280] dishwasher powder into his dishwasher and turns it on. \r\n[L4281] Each morning, Mrs. Kleen weighs the box of dishwasher \r\n[L4282] powder. From an examination of the data, she concludes \r\n[L4283] that Mr. Kleen dispenses a rather consistent amount \r\n[L4284] of powder each night. Which of the following statements \r\n[L4285] is true?\r\n[L4286] I. There is a high positive correlation between the \r\n[L4287] number of days that have passed since the box of dish\ufffewasher powder was opened and the amount of powder \r\n[L4288] left in the box.\r\n[L4289] II. A scatterplot with days since purchase as the explana\ufffetory variable and amount of dishwasher powder used as \r\n[L4290] the response variable would display a strong positive \r\n[L4291] association.\r\n[L4292] III. The correlation between the amount of powder left in \r\n[L4293] the box and the amount of powder used should be \u22121.\r\n[L4294] (a) I only (c) III only (e) I, II, and III\r\n[L4295] (b) II only (d) II and III only\r\n[L4296] AP1.10. The General Social Survey (GSS), conducted by \r\n[L4297] the National Opinion Research Center at the University \r\n[L4298] of Chicago, is a major source of data on social attitudes in \r\n[L4299] the United States. Once each year, 1500 adults are inter\ufffeviewed in their homes all across the country. The subjects \r\n[L4300] are asked their opinions about sex and marriage, attitudes \r\n[L4301] toward women, welfare, foreign policy, and many other \r\n[L4302] issues. The GSS begins by selecting a sample of counties \r\n[L4303] from the 3000 counties in the country. The counties are \r\n[L4304] divided into urban, rural, and suburban; a separate sample \r\n[L4305] is chosen at random from each group.

You are planning an experiment to determine \r\n[L4317] the effect of the brand of gasoline and the weight of a car \r\n[L4318] on gas mileage measured in miles per gallon. You will use \r\n[L4319] a single test car, adding weights so that its total weight is \r\n[L4320] 3000, 3500, or 4000 pounds. The car will drive on a test \r\n[L4321] track at each weight using each of Amoco, Marathon, and \r\n[L4322] Speedway gasoline. Which is the best way to organize the \r\n[L4323] study?\r\n[L4324] (a) Start with 3000 pounds and Amoco and run the car on \r\n[L4325] the test track. Then do 3500 and 4000 pounds. Change to \r\n[L4326] Marathon and go through the three weights in order. Then \r\n[L4327] change to Speedway and do the three weights in order\r\n[L4328] once more.\r\n[L4329] (b) Start with 3000 pounds and Amoco and run the car \r\n[L4330] on the test track. Then change to Marathon and then to \r\n[L4331] Speedway without changing the weight. Then add weights \r\n[L4332] to get 3500 pounds and go through the three gasolines in \r\n[L4333] the same order. Then change to 4000 pounds and do the \r\n[L4334] three gasolines in order again.\r\n[L4335] (c) Choose a gasoline at random, and run the car with this \r\n[L4336] gasoline at 3000, 3500, and 4000 pounds in order. Choose \r\n[L4337] one of the two remaining gasolines at random and again \r\n[L4338] run the car at 3000, then 3500, then 4000 pounds.

Those who advocate for monetary incentives in \r\n[L4403] a work environment claim that this type of incentive has \r\n[L4404] the greatest appeal because it allows the winners to do what \r\n[L4405] they want with their winnings. Those in favor of tangible \r\n[L4406] incentives argue that money lacks the emotional appeal of, \r\n[L4407] say, a weekend for two at a romantic country inn or elegant \r\n[L4408] hotel or a weeklong trip to Europe.\r\n[L4409] A few years ago a national tire company, in an effort to \r\n[L4410] improve sales of a new line of tires, decided to test which \r\n[L4411] method\u2014offering cash incentives or offering non-cash \r\n[L4412] prizes such as vacations\u2014was more successful in increas\ufffeing sales.

Not only are there national brands for \r\n[L4428] most products, but many stores have their own in-house \r\n[L4429] brands. Since shelf space is not infinite, the question is \r\n[L4430] how many linear feet to allocate to each product and \r\n[L4431] which shelf (top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle) \r\n[L4432] to put it on. The middle shelf is the most popular and lu\ufffecrative, since many shoppers, if undecided, will simply \r\n[L4433] pick the product that is at eye level. \r\n[L4434] A local store that sells many upscale goods is trying to \r\n[L4435] determine how much shelf space to allocate to its own \r\n[L4436] brand of men\u2019s personal-grooming products. The middle \r\n[L4437] shelf space is randomly varied between three and six lin\ufffeear feet over the next 12 weeks, and weekly sales revenue \r\n[L4438] (in dollars) from the store\u2019s brand of personal-grooming \r\n[L4439] products for men is recorded.

That\u2019s observational: students self-select, so differences may reflect motivation, parental support, etc. (lurking variables), not tuition itself. This is exactly why experiments are emphasized for causation. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1421-L1427\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 2) Lurking variables and confounding (why observational evidence can mislead)\n- **Lurking variable:** not the explanatory or response variable, but it may influence the response. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1479-L1481\ue201  \n- **Confounding:** when effects of two variables on the response cannot be separated (because they are associated in a way that mixes their effects). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1487-L1497\ue201  \n\nThe hormone/heart-attack story is used to illustrate that observational comparisons can be distorted because the \u201ctreatment\u201d group differs systematically in other ways (doctor visits, education, etc.). Random assignment \u201cbreaks\u201d such systematic links, preventing confounding by distributing those background factors roughly evenly. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1464-L1478\ue202L1501-L1507\ue201  \n\n**Mini-example (confounding explanation):**  \nSuppose people who take a supplement also exercise more. If supplement users have fewer heart attacks, you can\u2019t tell whether that\u2019s due to the supplement or exercise\u2014unless design prevents that mixing (e.g., random assignment).\n\n---\n\n### 3) The language of experiments (definitions you must use precisely)\n- **Treatment:** a specific condition applied in an experiment; if there are multiple explanatory variables, a treatment is a *combination* of specific values. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1526-L1529\ue201  \n- **Experimental unit:** the smallest unit to which a treatment is applied (humans = **subjects**). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1530-L1531\ue201  \n- **Explanatory vs response variables:** the experiment aims to see whether changing the explanatory variable(s) changes the response. (This is used repeatedly in examples.) \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1472-L1475\ue201  \n\nAlso:\n- **Factors:** explanatory variables in an experiment.  \n- **Levels:** specific values of a factor.  \nTreatments are built by combining one level from each factor. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1576-L1579\ue201  \n\n**Mini-example (factor/level/treatments):**  \nFactor A = temperature {70\u00b0F, 90\u00b0F}; Factor B = caffeine {0 mg, 200 mg}.  \nThen there are \\(2\\times 2=4\\) treatments: (70,0), (70,200), (90,0), (90,200).\n\n---\n\n### 4) Multifactor experiments and interaction\nA multifactor experiment lets you study the combined effect of factors and detect **interaction**\u2014when the effect of one factor depends on the level of another. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1609-L1615\ue201  \n\nThe text\u2019s TV-advertising example uses two factors (ad length and repetition) and lists the six treatments (all combinations). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1586-L1608\ue201  \n\n**Mini-example (interaction intuition with numbers):**  \nLet \u201cinterest score\u201d be the response.  \n- Short ad: 1 showing \u2192 +2 points; 5 showings \u2192 +6 points.  \n- Long ad: 1 showing \u2192 +3 points; 5 showings \u2192 **\u20131** point (people get annoyed).  \nHere, repetition helps when ads are short but hurts when ads are long \u2192 interaction.\n\n---\n\n### 5) \u201cHow to experiment badly\u201d (classic failure mode)\nA common bad design is **no comparison group and/or no random assignment**, so treatment effects get mixed up with pre-existing differences. The SAT example illustrates confounding because the online group differs from past in-class groups (higher GPA, more AP classes). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1644-L1664\ue201  \n\n**Rule of thumb:** if the groups weren\u2019t made comparable by design, you should expect confounding.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Randomized comparative experiment and random assignment\n- **Random assignment (definition):** assigning experimental units to treatments using chance. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1685-L1687\ue201  \n- The point: it prevents systematic favoritism and tends to balance lurking variables across groups (up to chance variation). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1874-L1882\ue201  \n\nThe text also stresses a subtle pitfall: \u201cusing chance\u201d isn\u2019t enough if you later override chance to force a pattern (e.g., stopping coin flips early and dumping remaining students into one group). That breaks the design and can reintroduce bias. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1749-L1763\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 7) Completely randomized design (CRD)\n- **Completely randomized design (definition):** treatments assigned to all experimental units *purely by chance*. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1744-L1745\ue201  \nThe diagrammatic idea is: pool all units \u2192 random assignment \u2192 treatment groups \u2192 compare responses. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1723-L1743\ue201  \n\n**Mini-example (CRD with numbers):**  \n60 households, 3 treatments (Display / Chart / Control). Randomly assign 20 to each treatment and compare yearly electricity use. This is the exact structure described. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1773-L1812\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 8) Control and control group (comparison is the first form of control)\nThe simplest \u201ccontrol\u201d is **comparison**: include two or more treatments so that other influences operate similarly on each group. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1874-L1878\ue201  \nA **control group** provides a baseline for comparing other treatments. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1813-L1817\ue201  \n\n**Mini-example (why baseline matters):**  \nIf electricity use drops by 8% this year for the display group, you still can\u2019t attribute it to the display unless you know what happened to similar homes without the display (weather, energy prices, etc.). This is explicitly the confounding concern discussed. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1842-L1848\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 9) The three principles of experimental design (the core \u201cresults\u201d)\nThe section canonically packages the design logic into:\n1) **Control** for lurking variables (comparative design; only systematic difference is treatment).  \n2) **Random assignment** (chance creates comparable groups).  \n3) **Replication** (enough units per treatment to distinguish treatment effects from chance variation). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1907-L1915\ue201  \n\nReplication is motivated by: with too few units, chance differences between groups can dominate; with many, chance tends to \u201caverage out.\u201d \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1897-L1905\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 10) Placebo effect and blinding (what can go wrong in human studies)\n- **Placebo effect:** improvement (or response) caused by receiving a dummy treatment / expecting treatment, not by an active ingredient. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1979-L1981\ue201  \nHence many studies are **placebo-controlled** so \u201ctaking a pill\u201d isn\u2019t confounded with the drug itself. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1958-L1964\ue201  \n\n- **Double-blind (definition):** neither subjects nor the people interacting with them/measuring responses know which treatment was received. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2022-L2024\ue201  \nThis reduces expectation-driven bias from both subjects and staff. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2001-L2008\ue201  \n\n**Mini-example (placebo arithmetic):**  \nIf 42% of a placebo group improve but 86% improve on a new drug, the drug appears to have an effect beyond placebo. (These are the magnitudes used to illustrate the idea.) \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1984-L2000\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 11) Inference for experiments and \u201cstatistically significant\u201d\n- **Statistically significant (definition):** an observed effect so large it would rarely occur by chance alone. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2040-L2042\ue201  \nIf differences are statistically significant in a well-designed randomized comparative experiment, that supports a **causal** conclusion (in the setting of the experiment). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2043-L2047\ue201  \n\nThe section also emphasizes that chance can produce \u201cunlucky\u201d imbalances, but that isn\u2019t called confounding if the design properly accounts for it via random assignment; instead, it\u2019s part of what significance testing addresses. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2103-L2114\ue201  \n\n**Mini-example (difference in proportions):**  \nIn the distracted-driving table: \u201cdidn\u2019t stop\u201d counts are 12/24 (cell phone) vs 3/24 (passenger). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2055-L2065\ue201  \nCompute:\n\\[\n\\hat p_{\\text{cell}}=\\frac{12}{24}=0.50,\\quad\n\\hat p_{\\text{pass}}=\\frac{3}{24}=0.125,\\quad\n\\hat p_{\\text{cell}}-\\hat p_{\\text{pass}}=0.375.\n\\]\nA randomization/simulation test then asks: would a gap \\(\\ge 0.375\\) commonly appear just from random assignment if the treatment had no effect? \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2065-L2093\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 12) Blocking, randomized block design, and matched pairs\nBlocking is introduced as a second form of control (beyond simple comparison): create groups of similar units to remove predictable variability, then randomize *within* each block. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2115-L2121\ue202L2180-L2184\ue201  \n\n- **Block (definition):** a group of experimental units known in advance to be similar in a way expected to affect response. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2176-L2178\ue201  \n- **Randomized block design (definition):** random assignment carried out separately within each block. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2178-L2179\ue201  \n\n**Mini-example (blocking with numbers):**  \nLaundry: block by color (light/dark), then within each color randomly assign half to cold water and half to warm water; compare cleanliness within each block and overall. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2140-L2152\ue201  \n\n- **Matched pairs design:** a common block design for *two* treatments; either (i) match similar units into pairs and randomize within each pair, or (ii) each unit receives both treatments in random order (unit is its own control). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2259-L2268\ue201  \n\n**Mini-example (matched pairs \u201cdifference\u201d analysis):**  \nIf each subject experiences both conditions, define\n\\[\nd_i = (\\text{standing pulse})_i - (\\text{sitting pulse})_i,\\qquad\n\\bar d = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n d_i.\n\\]\nThe text explicitly stresses that matched pairs are analyzed via within-pair differences, not by treating the two samples as independent. \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2305-L2333\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Practical \u201cformulae\u201d you\u2019ll repeatedly use in Section 4.2 contexts\nEven though this section is design-focused, it repeatedly points toward a few core computations:\n\n1) **Group mean response** (quantitative outcome):  \n\\[\n\\bar y = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\n\\]\n2) **Estimated treatment effect (two groups)**:  \n\\[\n\\widehat{\\Delta}=\\bar y_1-\\bar y_2\n\\]\n(\u201cdifferences in average response\u201d is the central comparison logic.) \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L1890-L1893\ue201  \n\n3) **Proportion response** (yes/no outcome):  \n\\[\n\\hat p = \\frac{x}{n},\\qquad \\widehat{\\Delta}_p=\\hat p_1-\\hat p_2\n\\]\n(as in the distracted-driving table). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2055-L2065\ue201  \n\n4) **Matched pairs differences**:  \n\\[\nd_i = y_{i,\\text{treat1}}-y_{i,\\text{treat2}},\\qquad \\bar d=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum d_i\n\\]\n(the recommended first step for paired data). \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file2\ue202L2305-L2307\ue201  \n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019re happy with this coverage and emphasis, I\u2019ll convert it into the same \u201clecture notes\u201d LaTeX style as before, and then (separately) produce a concise-answers LaTeX document for a curated set of Section 4.2 exercises."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":279,"end_ix":312,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf","id":"file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70","source":"my_files","text":"DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\nAn observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but ","extra":{"retrieval_turn":7,"retrieval_file_index":2,"cited_message_idx":62,"cited_message_id":"9035a56d-19a9-416b-88c9-48f83c854fc0","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":[1414,1418],"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":442,"end_ix":475,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf","id":"file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70","source":"my_files","text":"In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \nask them questions.

We can use the \r\n[L21] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L22] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L23] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L24] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L25] significant.\r\n[L26] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L27] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L28] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L29] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L30] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation.

The treatments are warm and cold water.\r\n[L3] DEFINITION: Block and randomized block design\r\n[L4] A block is a group of experimental units that are known before the experiment to be \r\n[L5] similar in some way that is expected to affect the response to the treatments.\r\n[L6] In a randomized block design, the random assignment of experimental units to treat\ufffements is carried out separately within each block.\r\n[L7] Blocks are another form of control. They control the effects of some outside \r\n[L8] variables by bringing those variables into the experiment to form the blocks. \r\n[L9] A randomized block design allows us to draw separate conclusions about each \r\n[L10] block, for example, about light-colored and dark-colored clothes in the laundry \r\n[L11] experiment. Blocking also allows more precise overall conclusions, because the <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 43 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 44 / 75>248 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L12] systematic differences between light- and dark-colored clothes can be removed \r\n[L13] when we study the overall effects of using this detergent in warm and cold \r\n[L14] water.\r\n[L15] The idea of blocking is an important additional principle of experimental \r\n[L16] design. A wise experimenter will form blocks based on the most important un\ufffeavoidable sources of variability (lurking variables) among the experimental units. \r\n[L17] Randomization will then average out the effects of the remaining lurking vari\ufffeables and allow an unbiased comparison of the treatments. The moral of the story \r\n[L18] is: control what you can, block on what you can\u2019t control, and randomize to create \r\n[L19] comparable groups.\r\n[L20] AP EXAM TIP Don\u2019t mix the \r\n[L21] language of experiments and the \r\n[L22] language of sample surveys or \r\n[L23] other observational studies.

The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L3] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L4] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L5] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L6] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L7] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L8] Matched pairs design\r\n[L9] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L10] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L11] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L12] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L13] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L14] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L15] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L16] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L17] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L18] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L19] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L20] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L21] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L22] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L23] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L24] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates?

Matched pairs design In a matched pairs design, each student should receive \r\n[L33] both treatments in a random order. Since you already sat or stood in Step 1, \r\n[L34] you just need to do the opposite now. As before, everyone should measure their \r\n[L35] pulses for one minute after completing the treatment (that is, once they are \r\n[L36] standing or sitting).

Is the result statistically significant?\r\n[L4] 6. What conclusion would you draw about whether talking on a cell phone is \r\n[L5] more distracting than talking to a passenger?\r\n[L6] Can an \u201cunlucky\u201d random assignment lead to confounding? Let\u2019s return \r\n[L7] to the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\n[L8] one group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L9] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L10] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L11] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L12] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L13] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L14] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L15] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L16] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L17] response to the treatments.\r\n[L18] Blocking\r\n[L19] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L20] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L21] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L22] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L23] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample. This same logic \r\n[L24] applies in experiments.\r\n[L25] ?\r\n[L26] THINK\r\n[L27] ABOUT\r\n[L28] IT\r\n[L29] EXAMPLE Doing the Laundry\r\n[L30] The idea of blocking\r\n[L31] Suppose researchers want to test whether a new detergent for clothes that require \r\n[L32] hand-washing cleans better in warm or in cold water. They decide to \r\n[L33] perform an experiment using numerous pieces of dirty laundry \r\n[L34] as the experimental units. The response variable is a cleanli\ufffeness rating on a scale of 0 (very dirty) to 10 (very clean). How \r\n[L35] should researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water? They could \r\n[L36] use a completely randomized design and hope that the \r\n[L37] random assignment distributes the light-colored clothing \r\n[L38] about evenly between the cold- and warm-water treatment \r\n[L39] groups. Even so, there might be a lot of variability in cleanli\ufffeness ratings in both groups due to the color of the clothing. This <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 42 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 43 / 75>Section 4.2 Experiments 247\r\n[L40] Figure 4.7 outlines the randomized block design for our laundry experiment. \r\n[L41] The experimental units are first separated into blocks to deal with the potential \r\n[L42] confounding variable, color. Then, the two treatments are randomly assigned \r\n[L43] within each block.\r\n[L44] lurking variable might make it difficult to detect a difference in the effects of the \r\n[L45] treatments. What should the researchers do?\r\n[L46] Since the researchers know that color may affect cleanliness in a systematic way, \r\n[L47] they could start by separating the laundry into two piles\u2014one for lighter colors \r\n[L48] and one for darker colors. Each of these piles of similar experimental units is \r\n[L49] known as a block. Within each block, the researchers could then randomly assign\r\n[L50] about half the pieces of laundry to be hand-washed in cold water and the other \r\n[L51] half to be hand-washed in warm water. The same person should do all the wash\ufffeing as a form of control.\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b86211c359fd2c0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_39.jpg","size_bytes":53857,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d135289ae6dda69#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_40.jpg","size_bytes":55956,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://c993044aba78ec0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_41.jpg","size_bytes":57863,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a60d05555b4a86b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_42.jpg","size_bytes":45738,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://4b105e7c3a7bc6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_43.jpg","size_bytes":47864,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null}],"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":8,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["slurm_github_pulls","slurm_github_issues","recording_knowledge","files_uploaded_in_conversation","slurm_github_commits","slurm_github"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"afeb795c-9648-4aa3-8a5c-0bdb21b5da7e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"5e1827e6-5fca-46a3-9303-bea8e59e9993","turn_exchange_id":"3c3f5c76-1a1a-448b-a235-4082a0cbd265"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5e1827e6-5fca-46a3-9303-bea8e59e9993","children":["991a2389-5f39-46cd-b07b-272c9d01df73"]},"991a2389-5f39-46cd-b07b-272c9d01df73":{"id":"991a2389-5f39-46cd-b07b-272c9d01df73","message":{"id":"991a2389-5f39-46cd-b07b-272c9d01df73","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768713343.768836,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Fetching full Section 4.2 context","content":"I need to gather the full content of Section 4.2, starting with its definitions and concepts like observational vs experimental studies.

It does \r\n[L23] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L24] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L25] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L26] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L27] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L28] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L29] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L30] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L31] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L32] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L33] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L34] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L35] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L36] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L37] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L38] than it really is.\r\n[L39] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments.

Of \r\n[L6] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L7] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L8] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L9] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L10] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L11] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L12] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L13] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L14] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L15] Placebo effect<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L16] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L17] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L18] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L19] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L20] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L21] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L22] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L23] the response variable do know.\r\n[L24] Single-blind\r\n[L25] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L26] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L27] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L28] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L29] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L30] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L31] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L32] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\n[L33] received the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n[L34] 1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n[L35] 2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n[L36] 3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L37] experiment.\r\n[L38] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L39] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L40] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L41] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L42] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L43] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L44] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L45] significant.\r\n[L46] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L47] caused these differences.\n# \u30102\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn9file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"9:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Researchers \r\n[L2] want to design an experiment to compare three thera\ufffepies for this cancer.

It is randomized because the sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments by chance. The diagram in Figure 4.4 presents \r\n[L20] the details: random assignment, the sizes of the groups and which treatment they \r\n[L21] receive, and the response variable. There are, as we will see later, statistical rea\ufffesons for using treatment groups that are about equal in size. This type of design is \r\n[L22] called a completely randomized design.\r\n[L23] 50 volunteer\r\n[L24] students\r\n[L25] Random\r\n[L26] assignment\r\n[L27] Group 1\r\n[L28] 25 students\r\n[L29] Group 2\r\n[L30] 25 students\r\n[L31] Compare\r\n[L32] SAT scores\r\n[L33] Treatment 2\r\n[L34] Classroom\r\n[L35] Treatment 1\r\n[L36] Online\r\n[L37] FIGURE 4.4 Outline of a completely randomized design to compare online and classroom \r\n[L38] instruction.\r\n[L39] DEFINITION: Completely randomized design\r\n[L40] In a completely randomized design, the treatments are assigned to all the experimen\ufffetal units completely by chance.\r\n[L41] Notice that the definition of a completely randomized design does not require \r\n[L42] that each treatment be assigned to an equal number of experimental units. It does \r\n[L43] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L44] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L45] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L46] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L47] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L48] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L49] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L50] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L51] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L52] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L53] then place the remaining students in the other group.\n# \u30104\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn9file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"9:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L2] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L3] discuss the tape with a small group of other students.

At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L5] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L6] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment. Follow the model of \r\n[L7] Figure 4.4.\r\n[L8] 2. Describe how you would carry out the random assignment. Provide enough detail that \r\n[L9] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L10] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L11] Three Principles of \r\n[L12] Experimental Design\r\n[L13] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L14] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L15] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L16] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L17] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L18] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L19] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L20] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L21] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L22] ?\r\n[L23] THINK\r\n[L24] ABOUT\r\n[L25] IT<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L26] EXAMPLE\r\n[L27] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L28] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L29] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L30] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L31] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L32] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L33] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L34] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L35] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L36] between the groups.\r\n[L37] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L38] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L39] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L40] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L41] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L42] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L43] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L44] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L45] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L46] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L47] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L48] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L49] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L50] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L51] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L52] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L53] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L54] experiment.\r\n[L55] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L56] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L57] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks?\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://805b683d71708bc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_33.jpg","size_bytes":52261,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5f524e37e570d88#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_34.jpg","size_bytes":54929,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b86211c359fd2c0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_39.jpg","size_bytes":53857,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://4bf0dd1d3947b7c#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_52.jpg","size_bytes":68003,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null}],"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":9,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["slurm_github_pulls","slurm_github_issues","recording_knowledge","files_uploaded_in_conversation","slurm_github_commits","slurm_github"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"afeb795c-9648-4aa3-8a5c-0bdb21b5da7e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"5f91f970-87e6-4c32-a9eb-bf1cd7aba2e9","turn_exchange_id":"3c3f5c76-1a1a-448b-a235-4082a0cbd265"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5f91f970-87e6-4c32-a9eb-bf1cd7aba2e9","children":["6d6c90f7-59e5-4af6-8d26-1bb08a75d633"]},"6d6c90f7-59e5-4af6-8d26-1bb08a75d633":{"id":"6d6c90f7-59e5-4af6-8d26-1bb08a75d633","message":{"id":"6d6c90f7-59e5-4af6-8d26-1bb08a75d633","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768713358.802094,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Curating and verifying Section 4.2 exercises","content":"I\u2019ve identified exercises 79\u201382 and maybe 74\u201377.

A doctor identified a painful \r\n[L11] site on each patient and asked him or her to rate the pain on a scale from 0 (mild pain) to \r\n[L12] 10 (severe pain). Then, the doctor selected a sealed envelope containing a magnet from a \r\n[L13] box that contained both active and inactive magnets. That way, neither the doctor nor the \r\n[L14] patient knew which type of magnet was being used. The chosen magnet was applied to \r\n[L15] the site of the pain for 45 minutes. After \u201ctreatment,\u201d each patient was again asked to rate \r\n[L16] the level of pain from 0 to 10.\r\n[L17] In all, 29 patients were given active magnets and 21 patients received inactive magnets. \r\n[L18] All but one of the patients rated their initial pain as an 8, 9, or 10. So scientists decided to \r\n[L19] focus on patients\u2019 final pain ratings.

Here are \r\n[L26] some examples:\r\n[L27] sThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\n[L28] seat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\n[L29] sAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\n[L30] an average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\n[L31] teens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\n[L32] unsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\n[L33] sA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\n[L34] of catching a cold.4\r\n[L35] sFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\n[L36] that listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\n[L37] Can we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\n[L38] depends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\n[L39] look at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\n[L40] Each year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\n[L41] vehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\n[L42] people in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\n[L43] of an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\n[L44] asking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\n[L45] conducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\n[L46] about some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\n[L47] In the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\n[L48] questions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\n[L49] them a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\n[L50] observational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\n[L51] drawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\n[L52] while listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\n[L53] list of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\n[L54] The goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\n[L55] changes in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\n[L56] the ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\n[L57] Here\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\n[L58] ACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\n[L59] MATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\n[L60] clock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\n[L61] Confucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget.

To answer the question, we will interview 16- to 20-year-olds \r\n[L70] who live in the United States and drive. Ideally, we would ask them all (take a \r\n[L71] census). But contacting every driver in this age group wouldn\u2019t be practical: it \r\n[L72] would take too much time and cost too much money. Instead, we put the question \r\n[L73] to a sample chosen to represent the entire population of young drivers.\r\n[L74] 4.1\r\n[L75] In Section 4.1, \r\n[L76] you\u2019ll learn about: \r\n[L77] sThe idea of a sample \r\n[L78] survey\r\n[L79] sHow to sample badly\r\n[L80] sHow to sample well: \r\n[L81] Random sampling\r\n[L82] sOther sampling methods\r\n[L83] sInference for sampling\r\n[L84] sSample surveys: What \r\n[L85] can go wrong?\r\n[L86] 1. Divide the class into pairs of students by drawing names from a hat.\r\n[L87] 2. Your teacher will give each pair two index cards with 10 sets of numbers \r\n[L88] on them. Do not look at the numbers until it is time for you to do the \r\n[L89] experiment.\r\n[L90] 3. Flip a coin to decide which of you is Student A and which is Student B. \r\n[L91] Shuffle the index cards and deal one face down to each partner.\r\n[L92] 4. Student A will attempt a memory task while Student B keeps time.\r\n[L93] Directions: Study the pairs of numbers on the index card for 30 seconds. Then \r\n[L94] turn the card over. Recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.). Then tell your part\ufffener (Student B) what you think the numbers on the card are. Student B will \r\n[L95] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L96] 5. Now it\u2019s Student B\u2019s turn to do a memory task while Student A records the data.\r\n[L97] Directions: Your partner will read the pairs of numbers on your index card aloud \r\n[L98] three times slowly. Next, you will recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.) and \r\n[L99] then tell your partner what you think the numbers on the card are. Student A will \r\n[L100] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L101] 6. Your teacher will scale and label axes on the board for parallel dotplots of the re\ufffesults. Plot the number of pairs you remembered correctly on the appropriate graph.\r\n[L102] 7. Did students in your class remember numbers better when they saw them or \r\n[L103] when they heard them? Give appropriate evidence to support your answer.\r\n[L104] 8. Based on the results of this experiment, can we conclude that people in gen\ufffeeral remember better when they see than when they hear? Why or why not?\r\n[L105] DEFINITION: Population and sample\r\n[L106] The population in a statistical study is the entire group of individuals about which we \r\n[L107] want information.\r\n[L108] A sample is the part of the population from which we actually collect information. We \r\n[L109] use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\n[L110] The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\n[L111] sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\n[L112] Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\n[L113] uses of sampling.","[L114] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L115] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","[L116] 208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L117] EXAMPLE\r\n[L118] EXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\n[L119] Populations and samples\r\n[L120] PROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n[L121] (a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\n[L122] before shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\n[L123] five pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\n[L124] moisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n[L125] (b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\n[L126] SOLUTION:\r\n[L127] (a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\n[L128] that are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n[L129] (b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\n[L130] For Practice Try Exercise 1\r\n[L131] The Idea of a Sample Survey\r\n[L132] We often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\n[L133] basis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\n[L134] and ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\n[L135] cream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\n[L136] whole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\n[L137] varied population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\n[L138] The first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\n[L139] what population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\n[L140] exactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\n[L141] We reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\n[L142] example. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\n[L143] or \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\n[L144] or more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example. We\u2019ll avoid this more \r\n[L145] restrictive terminology.\r\n[L146] Sample survey\r\n[L147] How Does the Current Population Survey Work?\r\n[L148] A sample survey\r\n[L149] One of the most important government sample surveys in the United States is \r\n[L150] the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS contacts about 60,000 \r\n[L151] households each month. It produces the monthly unemployment rate and much ","[L152] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://78b0ae7eaeb088a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":58525,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L153] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>","[L154] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 209\r\n[L155] The final step in planning a sample survey is to decide how to choose a sample \r\n[L156] from the population. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some good and not-so-good sam\ufffepling methods.\r\n[L157] How to Sample Badly\r\n[L158] How can we choose a sample that we can trust to represent the population? \r\n[L159] The easiest\u2014but not the best\u2014sampling method just chooses individuals who \r\n[L160] are close by. Suppose we\u2019re interested in finding out how long students at a \r\n[L161] large high school spent on homework last week, for example. We might go to \r\n[L162] the school library and ask the first 30 students we see about their homework \r\n[L163] time. A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\n[L164] easiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\n[L165] produce unrepresentative data.\r\n[L166] other economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\n[L167] specify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\n[L168] all U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\n[L169] not in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\n[L170] news refers to this specific population.\r\n[L171] What does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\n[L172] for example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\n[L173] she is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\n[L174] first asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\n[L175] work in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\n[L176] you are not in the labor force.\r\n[L177] If you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\n[L178] you did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\n[L179] you are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\n[L180] pay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\n[L181] because of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason. An unemployment rate \r\n[L182] of 9.7% means that 9.7% of the sample was unemployed, using the exact CPS \r\n[L183] definitions of both \u201clabor force\u201d and \u201cunemployed.\u201d\r\n[L184] DEFINITION: Convenience sample\r\n[L185] Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach results in a convenience sample.\r\n[L186] What\u2019s wrong with our convenience sample of students in the library? It\u2019s \r\n[L187] unlikely that this sample represents the homework habits of all students at the \r\n[L188] school well. In fact, we\u2019d expect the sample to overestimate the average homework \r\n[L189] time in the population since students who hang out in the library might tend to \r\n[L190] be more studious. This is bias: using a method that will consistently overestimate \r\n[L191] or underestimate the value you want to know.","[L192] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bea60ae105051c9#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_4.jpg","size_bytes":53957,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L193] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>","[L194] 210 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L195] EXAMPLE\r\n[L196] DEFINITION: Bias\r\n[L197] The design of a statistical study shows bias if it systematically favors certain outcomes.\r\n[L198] Convenience samples are almost guaranteed to show bias. So are voluntary \r\n[L199] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L200] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L201] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L202] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L203] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L204] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L205] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L206] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L207] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L208] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L209] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L210] to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\n[L211] Illegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\n[L212] Online polls\r\n[L213] Former CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\n[L214] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L215] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L216] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L217] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L218] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L219] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L220] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L221] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L222] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L223] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L224] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L225] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L226] the direction of the bias. Suppose you were asked, \u201cExplain how using a convenience sample of students in \r\n[L227] your statistics class to estimate the proportion of all high school students who own a graphing calculator could \r\n[L228] result in bias.\u201d You might respond, \u201cThis sample would probably include a much higher proportion of students \r\n[L229] with a graphing calculator than in the population at large because a graphing calculator is required for the \r\n[L230] statistics class. That is, this method would probably lead to an overestimate of the actual population proportion.\u201d\r\n[L231] www\r\n[L232] For Practice Try Exercise 5","[L233] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6ad2f94da5ad6a1#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_5.jpg","size_bytes":57756,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L234] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>","[L235] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 211\r\n[L236] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L237] For each of the following situations, identify the sampling method used.

More than 186,000 callers responded, and 67% said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n[L244] How to Sample Well: \r\n[L245] Random Sampling\r\n[L246] In a voluntary response sample, people choose whether to respond. In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L247] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L248] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L249] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L250] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L251] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L252] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L253] random sample.\r\n[L254] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L255] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L256] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L257] sample actually selected.\r\n[L258] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L259] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L260] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L261] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L262] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L263] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L264] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L265] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L266] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L267] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L268] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L269] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L270] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L271] if the population is large.

If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L280] random digits.\r\n[L281] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L282] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L283] these properties:\r\n[L284] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L285] s The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\n[L286] gives no information about any other part.\r\n[L287] Table D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\n[L288] digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\n[L289] in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\n[L290] the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\n[L291] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L292] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L293] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L294] same length.\r\n[L295] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L296] from Table D.\r\n[L297] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L298] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L299] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L300] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L301] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L302] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L303] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L304] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L305] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L306] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L307] and so on\u2014because the table has no order. We recommend reading across rows \r\n[L308] from left to right.","[L309] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://fed072027c0760d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_7.jpg","size_bytes":43027,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L310] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 75>","[L311] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 213\r\n[L312] Spring Break!\r\n[L313] Choosing an SRS with Table D\r\n[L314] The school newspaper is planning an article on family-friendly \r\n[L315] places to stay over spring break at a nearby beach town.

What \r\n[L394] advantage(s) does random sampling provide?\r\n[L395] There\u2019s an important difference between the samples produced by the Simple\r\n[L396] Random Sample applet and the calculator\u2019s randInt command in the Technol\ufffeogy Corner. The applet sampled without replacement from the \u201cPopulation hop\ufffeper,\u201d but the calculator sampled with replacement from the specified population. \r\n[L397] As a result, the calculator sometimes selects the same number more than once in \r\n[L398] a given sample. To deal with this problem, you can generate additional random \r\n[L399] numbers as needed to replace any repeats. Or you can use a method other than \r\n[L400] randInt (like randSamp on the TI-Nspire) to sample without replacement. Refer \r\n[L401] to your device\u2019s reference manual or ask your teacher.\r\n[L402] We can trust results from an SRS, as well as from other types of random samples \r\n[L403] that we will meet later, because the use of impersonal chance avoids bias. Online\r\n[L404] and call-in polls also produce samples. But we can\u2019t trust results from these sam\ufffeples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. The first question to ask about \r\n[L405] any sample is whether it was chosen at random.\r\n[L406] Other Sampling Methods\r\n[L407] The basic idea of sampling is straightforward: take an SRS from the population \r\n[L408] and use your sample results to gain information about the population. Unfor\ufffetunately, it\u2019s usually very difficult to actually get an SRS from the population of \r\n[L409] interest. Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L410] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L411] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L412] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L413] selected. Sometimes, there are also statistical advantages to using more complex \r\n[L414] sampling methods.","[L415] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 11 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://10ecedd5bee1a96#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_10.jpg","size_bytes":60902,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L416] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 75>","[L417] 216 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L418] One of the most common alternatives to an SRS involves sampling important \r\n[L419] groups (called strata) within the population separately. Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L420] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L421] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L422] between strata.\r\n[L423] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L424] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L425] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L426] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L427] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L428] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L429] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L430] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L431] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size. Not convinced? Try \r\n[L432] the following Activity.\r\n[L433] ACTIVITY Sampling sunflowers\r\n[L434] A British farmer grows sunflowers for making sunflower oil. Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L435] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L436] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L437] money she\u2019ll make from selling them. It would take too much time to \r\n[L438] count the plants in all 100 squares, so she\u2019ll accept an estimate based on \r\n[L439] a sample of 10 squares.\r\n[L440] 1. Use Table D or technology to take a simple random sample of 10 \r\n[L441] grid squares. Record the location (for example, B6) of each square you \r\n[L442] select.\r\n[L443] 2. This time, you\u2019ll take a stratified random sample using the \r\n[L444] rows as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select \r\n[L445] one square from each (horizontal) row. Record the location of \r\n[L446] each square.\r\n[L447] 3. Now, take a stratified random sample using the columns\r\n[L448] as strata.

How did the three sampling methods do?\r\n[L472] The following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\n[L473] in the music business.\r\n[L474] Who Wrote That Song?\r\n[L475] Using a stratified random sample\r\n[L476] A radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\n[L477] The organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\n[L478] members by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\n[L479] ASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\n[L480] year. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L481] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L482] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L483] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L484] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L485] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L486] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L487] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L488] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L489] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L490] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L491] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L492] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L493] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups. Ideally, these \r\n[L494] clusters should mirror the characteristics of the population. Then choose an SRS of the \r\n[L495] clusters. All individuals in the chosen clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L496] Imagine a large high school that assigns its students to homerooms alphabeti\ufffecally by last name. The school administration is considering a new schedule and \r\n[L497] would like student input. Administrators decide to survey 200 randomly selected \r\n[L498] students.

They don\u2019t offer the statistical advantage of better information about the \r\n[L507] population that stratified random samples do. That\u2019s because clusters are often \r\n[L508] chosen for ease or convenience, so they may have as much variability as the popu\ufffelation itself. Be sure you understand the difference between strata and clusters. \r\n[L509] We want each stratum to contain similar individuals, and for there to be large \r\n[L510] differences between strata.

Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L619] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L620] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L621] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L622] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L623] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L624] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L625] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L626] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L627] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L628] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L629] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L630] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L631] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L632] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L633] Sampling Units, or PSUs. Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\n[L634] the 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\n[L635] of the others.\r\n[L636] Stage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\n[L637] Stratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\n[L638] Stage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\n[L639] units. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\n[L640] Analyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\n[L641] beyond basic statistics. But the SRS is the building block of more elaborate \r\n[L642] methods, and the principles of analysis remain much the same for these other \r\n[L643] methods.\r\n[L644] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L645] The manager of a sports arena wants to learn more about the financial status of the people \r\n[L646] who are attending an NBA basketball game.

Ticket prices for the game vary a \r\n[L647] great deal: seats near the court cost over $100 each, while seats in \r\n[L648] the top rows of the arena cost $25 each. The arena is divided into \r\n[L649] 30 numbered sections, from 101 to 130.

The \r\n[L666] process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\n[L667] called inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\n[L668] we know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\n[L669] response samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\n[L670] the population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\n[L671] selecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\n[L672] Still, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\n[L673] the entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\n[L674] the monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\n[L675] population. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\n[L676] almost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\n[L677] Inference\r\n[L678] ACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\n[L679] MATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\n[L680] other container that students can\u2019t see through\r\n[L681] In this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\n[L682] in relation to the population truth.\r\n[L683] 1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\n[L684] particular color.\r\n[L685] 2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\n[L686] record the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\n[L687] returned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n[L688] 3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\n[L689] is the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\n[L690] center? Is there a clear shape?\r\n[L691] Why can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\n[L692] results of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\n[L693] Because we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\n[L694] govern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\n[L695] results are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\n[L696] random sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\n[L697] the population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\n[L698] sets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\n[L699] for sampling later.\r\n[L700] One point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples. For instance, in the Activity, \r\n[L701] you would get a better estimate of the proportion of red chips in the popula\ufffeMargin of error","[L702] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 16 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://136106c58c36cbc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_15.jpg","size_bytes":54135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L703] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>","[L704] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 221\r\n[L705] tion using random samples of 40 chips than 20 chips. By taking a very large \r\n[L706] sample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\n[L707] about the population.\r\n[L708] The Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\n[L709] expect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\n[L710] of the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n[L711] 3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\n[L712] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L713] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L714] clicked a response.\r\n[L715] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L716] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L717] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L718] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L719] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L720] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L721] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L722] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L723] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L724] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L725] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L726] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L727] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L728] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L729] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L730] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L731] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L732] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L733] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L734] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L735] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L736] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L737] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L738] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L739] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L740] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L741] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L742] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L743] Sampling frame","[L744] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L745] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","[L746] 222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L747] EXAMPLE\r\n[L748] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L749] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L750] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L751] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L752] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L753] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L754] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L755] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L756] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L757] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L758] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L759] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L760] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L761] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L762] refuses to participate.\r\n[L763] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L764] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L765] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L766] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L767] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L768] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L769] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L770] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L771] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L772] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L773] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L774] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L775] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L776] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L777] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L778] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L779] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","[L780] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L781] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","[L782] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L783] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L784] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L785] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L786] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L787] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L788] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L789] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L790] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L791] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L792] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L793] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L794] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L795] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L796] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L797] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L798] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L799] memory. \u201cHave you visited a dentist in the last 6 months?\u201d will often draw a \r\n[L800] \u201cYes\u201d from someone who last visited a dentist 8 months ago.10 Careful training \r\n[L801] of interviewers and careful supervision to avoid variation among the interview\ufffeers can reduce response bias.

Different questions \r\n[L818] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L819] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L820] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L821] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L822] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L823] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L824] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L825] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L826] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L827] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L828] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L829] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L830] 1.

Here is the actual question:\r\n[L837] It is estimated that disposable diapers account for less than 2% of the trash in today\u2019s \r\n[L838] landfills. In contrast, beverage containers, third-class mail and yard wastes are estimated\r\n[L839] to account for about 21% of the trash in landfills. Given this, in your opinion, would it \r\n[L840] be fair to ban disposable diapers?11\r\n[L841] Explain how the wording of the question could result in bias. Be sure to specify the direc\ufffetion of the bias.\r\n[L842] Wording of questions\r\n[L843] ?\r\n[L844] THINK\r\n[L845] ABOUT\r\n[L846] IT\r\n[L847] EXAMPLE","[L848] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 20 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://248f22efb09cc94#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_19.jpg","size_bytes":52135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L849] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>","[L850] s A sample survey selects a sample from the population of all individuals \r\n[L851] about which we desire information. We base conclusions about the \r\n[L852] population on data from the sample. It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L853] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L854] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L855] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L856] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L857] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L858] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L859] process.\r\n[L860] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L861] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L862] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L863] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L864] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L865] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L866] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L867] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L868] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L869] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L870] prone to large bias.\r\n[L871] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L872] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L873] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L874] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L875] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L876] errors. These have nothing to do with choosing a sample\u2014they are \r\n[L877] present even in a census. The single biggest problem for sample surveys \r\n[L878] is nonresponse: people can\u2019t be contacted or refuse to answer. Incorrect \r\n[L879] answers by respondents can lead to response bias. Finally, the exact \r\n[L880] wording of questions has a big influence on the answers.\r\n[L881] Summary SECTION 4.1\r\n[L882] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 225\r\n[L883] 4.1 TECHNOLOGY CORNER\r\n[L884] Choosing an SRS..................................................................... page 214\r\n[L885] TI-Nspire instructions in Appendix B","[L886] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://af94379ba136b08#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_20.jpg","size_bytes":47602,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 75>","[L888] 226 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L889] 1. Students as customers A high school\u2019s student \r\n[L890] newspaper plans to survey local businesses about the \r\n[L891] importance of students as customers. From telephone \r\n[L892] book listings, the newspaper staff chooses 150 busi\ufffenesses at random. Of these, 73 return the question\ufffenaire mailed by the staff. Identify the population and \r\n[L893] the sample.\r\n[L894] 2. Student archaeologists An archaeological dig turns \r\n[L895] up large numbers of pottery shards, broken stone \r\n[L896] tools, and other artifacts. Students working on the \r\n[L897] project classify each artifact and assign it a number. \r\n[L898] The counts in different categories are important for \r\n[L899] understanding the site, so the project director chooses \r\n[L900] 2% of the artifacts at random and checks the students\u2019 \r\n[L901] work. Identify the population and the sample.\r\n[L902] 3. Sampling stuffed envelopes A large retailer prepares \r\n[L903] its customers\u2019 monthly credit card bills using an \r\n[L904] automatic machine that folds the bills, stuffs them \r\n[L905] into envelopes, and seals the envelopes for mailing. \r\n[L906] Are the envelopes completely sealed? Inspectors \r\n[L907] choose 40 envelopes from the 1000 stuffed each hour \r\n[L908] for visual inspection. Identify the population and the \r\n[L909] sample.\r\n[L910] 4. Customer satisfaction A department store mails \r\n[L911] a customer satisfaction survey to people who make \r\n[L912] credit card purchases at the store. This month, 45,000 \r\n[L913] people made credit card purchases. Surveys are \r\n[L914] mailed to 1000 of these people, chosen at random, \r\n[L915] and 137 people return the survey form. Identify the \r\n[L916] population and the sample.\r\n[L917] 5. Call the shots A newspaper advertisement for an \r\n[L918] upcoming TV show said: \u201cShould handgun control \r\n[L919] be tougher? You call the shots in a special call-in \r\n[L920] poll tonight. If yes, call 1-900-720-6181. If no, call \r\n[L921] 1-900-720-6182. Charge is 50 cents for the first \r\n[L922] minute.\u201d Explain why this opinion poll is almost \r\n[L923] certainly biased.\r\n[L924] 6. Explain it to the congresswoman You are on the \r\n[L925] staff of a member of Congress who is considering a \r\n[L926] bill that would provide government-sponsored insur\ufffeance for nursing-home care. You report that 1128 letters \r\n[L927] have been received on the issue, of which 871 oppose \r\n[L928] the legislation. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that most of my con\ufffestituents oppose the bill. I thought it would be quite \r\n[L929] popular,\u201d says the congresswoman. Are you convinced \r\n[L930] that a majority of the voters oppose the bill? How would \r\n[L931] you explain the statistical issue to the congresswoman?\r\n[L932] 7. Instant opinion A recent online poll posed the ques\ufffetion \u201cShould female athletes be paid the same as men \r\n[L933] for the work they do?\u2019\u2019 In all, 13,147 (44%) said \u201cYes,\u2019\u2019 \r\n[L934] 15,182 (50%) said \u201cNo,\u2019\u2019 and the remaining 1448 said \r\n[L935] \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d In spite of the large sample size for this \r\n[L936] survey, we can\u2019t trust the result. Why not?\r\n[L937] 8. Online polls In June 2008, Parade magazine posed \r\n[L938] the following question: \u201cShould drivers be banned \r\n[L939] from using all cell phones?\u201d Readers were encour\ufffeaged to vote online at parade.com. The July 13, 2008, \r\n[L940] issue of Parade reported the results: 2407 \r\n[L941] (85%) said \u201cYes\u201d and 410 (15%) said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n[L942] (a) What type of sample did the Parade survey \r\n[L943] obtain?\r\n[L944] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n[L945] 85% probably higher or lower than the true percent \r\n[L946] of all adults who believe that cell phone use while \r\n[L947] driving should be banned? Why?\r\n[L948] 9. Sleepless nights How much sleep do high school \r\n[L949] students get on a typical school night? An interested \r\n[L950] student designed a survey to find out. To make data \r\n[L951] collection easier, the student surveyed the first 100 \r\n[L952] students to arrive at school on a particular morning. \r\n[L953] These students reported an average of 7.2 hours of \r\n[L954] sleep on the previous night.\r\n[L955] (a) What type of sample did the student obtain?\r\n[L956] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n[L957] 7.2 hours probably higher or lower than the true aver\ufffeage amount of sleep last night for all students at the \r\n[L958] school? Why?\r\n[L959] 10. Sampling at the mall You have probably seen the \r\n[L960] mall interviewer, approaching people passing by with \r\n[L961] clipboard in hand. Explain why even a large sample \r\n[L962] of mall shoppers would not provide a trustworthy \r\n[L963] estimate of the current unemployment rate.\r\n[L964] 11. Do you trust the Internet? You want to ask a sample \r\n[L965] of high school students the question \u201cHow much do \r\n[L966] you trust information about health that you find on \r\n[L967] the Internet\u2014a great deal, somewhat, not much, or \r\n[L968] not at all?\u201d You try out this and other questions on a \r\n[L969] pilot group of 5 students chosen from your class. The \r\n[L970] class members are listed at top right.\r\n[L971] (a) Explain how you would use a line of Table D to \r\n[L972] choose an SRS of 5 students from the following list. \r\n[L973] Explain your method clearly enough for a classmate \r\n[L974] to obtain your results.\r\n[L975] pg 208\r\n[L976] pg 210\r\n[L977] pg 213\r\n[L978] SECTION 4.1 Exercises\r\n[L979] www","[L980] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 22 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6ed199a819f4209#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_21.jpg","size_bytes":69624,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L981] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 75>","[L982] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 227\r\n[L983] (b) Use line 107 to select the sample.

Sampling the forest To gather data on a 1200-acre \r\n[L1013] pine forest in Louisiana, the U.S. Forest Service laid a \r\n[L1014] grid of 1410 equally spaced circular plots over a map \r\n[L1015] of the forest. A ground survey visited a sample of 10% \r\n[L1016] of these plots.12\r\n[L1017] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table D \r\n[L1018] to choose an SRS of 141 plots.

Sampling gravestones The local genealogical society \r\n[L1023] in Coles County, Illinois, has compiled records on all \r\n[L1024] 55,914 gravestones in cemeteries in the county for the \r\n[L1025] years 1825 to 1985. Historians plan to use these records \r\n[L1026] to learn about African Americans in Coles County\u2019s his\ufffetory. They first choose an SRS of 395 records to check \r\n[L1027] their accuracy by visiting the actual gravestones.13\r\n[L1028] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table \r\n[L1029] D to choose the SRS. Your description should be \r\n[L1030] clear enough for a classmate to obtain your results.\r\n[L1031] (b) Use your method from (a) to choose the first \r\n[L1032] 3 gravestones.\r\n[L1033] 15. Random digits In using Table D repeatedly to \r\n[L1034] choose random samples, you should not always begin \r\n[L1035] at the same place, such as line 101. Why not?\r\n[L1036] 16. Random digits Which of the following statements \r\n[L1037] are true of a table of random digits, and which are \r\n[L1038] false? Briefly explain your answers.\r\n[L1039] (a) There are exactly four 0s in each row of 40 digits.\r\n[L1040] (b) Each pair of digits has chance 1/100 of being 00.\r\n[L1041] (c) The digits 0000 can never appear as a group, \r\n[L1042] because this pattern is not random.\r\n[L1043] 17. iPhones Suppose 1000 iPhones are produced at a \r\n[L1044] factory today. Management would like to ensure \r\n[L1045] that the phones\u2019 display screens meet their quality \r\n[L1046] standards before shipping them to retail stores. Since \r\n[L1047] it takes about 10 minutes to inspect an individual \r\n[L1048] phone\u2019s display screen, managers decide to inspect a \r\n[L1049] sample of 20 phones from the day\u2019s production.\r\n[L1050] (a) Explain why it would be difficult for managers to \r\n[L1051] inspect an SRS of 20 iPhones that are produced today.\r\n[L1052] (b) An eager employee suggests that it would be easy \r\n[L1053] to inspect the last 20 iPhones that were produced \r\n[L1054] today. Why isn\u2019t this a good idea?\r\n[L1055] (c) Another employee recommends inspecting every \r\n[L1056] fiftieth iPhone that is produced. Explain carefully \r\n[L1057] why this sampling method is not an SRS.\r\n[L1058] 18. Dead trees On the west side of Rocky Mountain \r\n[L1059] National Park, many mature pine trees are dying due \r\n[L1060] to infestation by pine beetles. Scientists would like to \r\n[L1061] use sampling to estimate the proportion of all pine \r\n[L1062] trees in the area that have been infected.\r\n[L1063] (a) Explain why it wouldn\u2019t be practical for scientists \r\n[L1064] to obtain an SRS in this setting.\r\n[L1065] (b) A possible alternative would be to use every pine \r\n[L1066] tree along the park\u2019s main road as a sample. Why is \r\n[L1067] this sampling method biased?\r\n[L1068] (c) Suppose that a more complicated random sam\ufffepling plan is carried out, and that 35% of the pine trees \r\n[L1069] in the sample are infested by the pine beetle. Can \r\n[L1070] scientists conclude that 35% of all the pine trees on the \r\n[L1071] west side of the park are infested? Why or why not?\r\n[L1072] 19. Who goes to the convention?

It decides to choose those who will \r\n[L1087] go by random selection. How will you label the two \r\n[L1088] strata? Use Table D, beginning at line 123, to choose \r\n[L1089] a stratified random sample of 4 students and 2 faculty \r\n[L1090] members.\r\n[L1091] 20. Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\n[L1092] stratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\n[L1093] records of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\n[L1094] stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\n[L1095] and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\n[L1096] One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\n[L1097] these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\n[L1098] amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000. Using these \r\n[L1099] groups as strata, you decide to verify all the largest \r\n[L1100] accounts and to sample 5% of the midsize accounts \r\n[L1101] and 1% of the small accounts. How would you label \r\n[L1102] the two strata from which you will sample? Use Table \r\n[L1103] D, starting at line 115, to select only the first 3 \r\n[L1104] accounts from each of these strata.\r\n[L1105] 21. Go Blue! Michigan Stadium, also known as \u201cThe Big \r\n[L1106] House,\u201d seats over 100,000 fans for a football game. \r\n[L1107] The University of Michigan athletic department plans \r\n[L1108] to conduct a survey about concessions that are sold \r\n[L1109] during games. Tickets are most expensive for seats \r\n[L1110] near the field and on the sideline. The cheapest seats \r\n[L1111] are high up in the end zones (where one of the au\ufffethors sat as a student).

The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L1153] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L1154] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L1155] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L1156] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L1157] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L1158] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L1159] might be preferable to an SRS in this case. What \r\n[L1160] would you use as strata?\r\n[L1161] (b) Why might a cluster sample be a simpler option? \r\n[L1162] What would you use as clusters?\r\n[L1163] 23. Is it an SRS? A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L1164] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L1165] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L1166] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L1167] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L1168] Explain your answer.\r\n[L1169] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L1170] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L1171] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L1172] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L1173] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L1174] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L1175] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L1176] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L1177] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L1178] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L1179] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L1180] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L1181] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L1182] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L1183] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L1184] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L1185] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L1186] method?\r\n[L1187] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L1188] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L1189] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L1190] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L1191] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L1192] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L1193] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L1194] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1195] sample.\r\n[L1196] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L1197] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L1198] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L1199] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L1200] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L1201] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L1202] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L1203] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L1204] pg 218","[L1205] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1206] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","[L1207] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L1208] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1209] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200.

Then explain carefully why a system\ufffeatic sample is not an SRS.\r\n[L1214] 27. Sampling frame Ideally, the sampling frame in a \r\n[L1215] sample survey should list every individual in the \r\n[L1216] population, but in practice, this is often difficult. \r\n[L1217] Suppose that a sample of households in a community \r\n[L1218] is selected at random from the telephone directory. \r\n[L1219] Explain how this sampling method results in under\ufffecoverage that could lead to bias.\r\n[L1220] 28. Sampling frame Refer to the previous exercise. It is \r\n[L1221] more common in telephone surveys to use random \r\n[L1222] digit dialing equipment that selects the last four digits \r\n[L1223] of a telephone number at random after being given \r\n[L1224] the exchange (the first three digits).

You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\n[L1230] to conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\n[L1231] allow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\n[L1232] seats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\n[L1233] you randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\n[L1234] stadium. During the game, you ask the fans in those \r\n[L1235] seats how much they spent that day.\r\n[L1236] (a) Provide a reason why this survey might yield a \r\n[L1237] biased result.\r\n[L1238] (b) Explain whether the reason you provided in (a) is \r\n[L1239] a sampling error or a nonsampling error.\r\n[L1240] 30.

Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\n[L1248] sampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\n[L1249] the United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n[L1250] 5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\n[L1251] estimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n[L1252] (a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n[L1253] (b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\n[L1254] survey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n[L1255] 32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\n[L1256] in telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\n[L1257] call is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\n[L1258] The Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\n[L1259] nonresponse to a government survey of households \r\n[L1260] in Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\n[L1261] July 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\n[L1262] and 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\n[L1263] period versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\n[L1264] period.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\n[L1265] rate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\n[L1266] nonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n[L1267] 33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n[L1268] 31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\n[L1269] answer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\n[L1270] drove through, how many of them were red when you \r\n[L1271] entered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n[L1272] 171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\n[L1273] practical problem with this survey is that people may \r\n[L1274] not give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\n[L1275] of the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n[L1276] 880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n[L1277] 34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\n[L1278] belt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\n[L1279] chosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\n[L1280] they were invited to answer questions that included \r\n[L1281] questions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\n[L1282] always used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\n[L1283] seat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\n[L1284] lots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey.

Sample surveys are one kind of observational\r\n[L1406] study. Other observational studies watch the behavior of animals in the wild or the \r\n[L1407] interactions between teacher and students in the classroom. This section is about \r\n[L1408] statistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\n[L1409] Observational Study versus Experiment\r\n[L1410] In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\n[L1411] ask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\n[L1412] response. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\n[L1413] of a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\n[L1414] DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\n[L1415] An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\n[L1416] does not attempt to influence the responses.\r\n[L1417] An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\n[L1418] responses.\r\n[L1419] The goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\n[L1420] to compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\n[L1421] of an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\n[L1422] response. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\n[L1423] way to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\n[L1424] see the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\n[L1425] is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\n[L1426] data. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\n[L1427] is one of the most important in statistics.\r\n[L1428] Does Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\n[L1429] after Menopause?\r\n[L1430] Observation versus experiment\r\n[L1431] Should women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\n[L1432] production of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\n[L1433] a heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\n[L1434] small compared with the benefits.\r\n[L1435] The evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\n[L1436] hormones with others who were not. But the women who chose to \r\n[L1437] take hormones were richer and better educated and saw doctors \r\n[L1438] more often than women who didn\u2019t take hormones.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L1466] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L1467] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L1468] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L1469] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L1470] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L1471] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L1472] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L1473] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L1474] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L1475] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L1476] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L1477] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L1478] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L1479] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L1480] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L1481] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L1482] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L1483] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L1484] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L1485] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L1486] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L1487] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L1488] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L1489] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L1490] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L1491] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L1492] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L1493] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L1494] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L1495] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L1496] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L1497] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","[L1498] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1499] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","[L1500] Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L1501] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L1502] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L1503] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L1504] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L1505] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L1506] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L1507] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L1508] results of the earlier observational studies.

Suggest a lurking variable that may be confounded \r\n[L1523] with whether families eat dinner together.\r\n[L1524] The Language of Experiments\r\n[L1525] An experiment is a statistical study in which we actually do something (a treat\ufffement) to people, animals, or objects (the experimental units) to observe the re\ufffesponse. Here is the basic vocabulary of experiments.\r\n[L1526] DEFINITION: Treatment, experimental units, subjects\r\n[L1527] A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment.\r\n[L1528] If an experiment has several explanatory variables, a treatment is a combination of \r\n[L1529] specific values of these variables.\r\n[L1530] The experimental units are the smallest collection of individuals to which treatments \r\n[L1531] are applied. When the units are human beings, they often are called subjects.\r\n[L1532] The best way to learn the language of experiments is to practice using it.\r\n[L1533] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1534] are asked to identify a \r\n[L1535] possible confounding \r\n[L1536] variable in a given \r\n[L1537] setting, you are \r\n[L1538] expected to explain how \r\n[L1539] the variable you choose \r\n[L1540] (1) is associated with \r\n[L1541] the explanatory variable \r\n[L1542] and (2) affects the \r\n[L1543] response variable.","[L1544] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1545] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>","[L1546] 234 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1547] EXAMPLE When Will I Ever Use This Stuff?\r\n[L1548] Vocabulary of experiments\r\n[L1549] Researchers at the University of North Carolina were concerned about the \r\n[L1550] increasing dropout rate in the state\u2019s high schools, especially for low-income stu\ufffedents. Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\n[L1551] started to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\n[L1552] To change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\n[L1553] the topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\n[L1554] To test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\n[L1555] the schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\n[L1556] standard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\n[L1557] curriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\n[L1558] years, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\n[L1559] scores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\n[L1560] high school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\n[L1561] greater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\n[L1562] PROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\n[L1563] in the CareerStart experiment.\r\n[L1564] SOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\n[L1565] variable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\n[L1566] compares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\n[L1567] behavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\n[L1568] The previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\n[L1569] trying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\n[L1570] all 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\n[L1571] of schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\n[L1572] researchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\n[L1573] systematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\n[L1574] students from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\n[L1575] program made the difference.\r\n[L1576] Sometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\n[L1577] experiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\n[L1578] treatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\n[L1579] the factors. Here\u2019s an example of a multifactor experiment.\r\n[L1580] Factors\r\n[L1581] Level\r\n[L1582] For Practice Try Exercise 51","[L1583] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://26b92d516ab78a7#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_29.jpg","size_bytes":63833,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1584] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>","[L1585] Section 4.2 Experiments 235\r\n[L1586] EXAMPLE TV Advertising\r\n[L1587] Experiments with multiple explanatory variables\r\n[L1588] What are the effects of repeated exposure to an advertising message? The answer \r\n[L1589] may depend on both the length of the ad and on how often it is repeat\ufffeed. An experiment investigated this question using undergraduate stu\ufffedents as subjects. All subjects viewed a 40-minute television program \r\n[L1590] that included ads for a digital camera. Some subjects saw a 30-second \r\n[L1591] commercial; others, a 90-second version. The same commercial was \r\n[L1592] shown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After viewing, all the \r\n[L1593] subjects answered questions about their recall of the ad, their attitude \r\n[L1594] toward the camera, and their intention to purchase it.21\r\n[L1595] PROBLEM: For the advertising study,\r\n[L1596] (a) identify the explanatory and response variables, and\r\n[L1597] (b) list all the treatments.\r\n[L1598] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1599] (a) This experiment has 2 explanatory variables (factors): \r\n[L1600] length of the commercial and number of repetitions. The response \r\n[L1601] variables include measures of subjects\u2019 recall of the ad, their \r\n[L1602] attitudes about the digital camera, and whether they intend to \r\n[L1603] purchase it.\r\n[L1604] (b) There are 2 different lengths of commercial (30 and 90 seconds) \r\n[L1605] and three different numbers of repetitions (1, 3, and 5). The 6 combi\ufffenations consisting of one level of each factor form the 6 treatments \r\n[L1606] shown in Figure 4.3: (1) 30 seconds, 1 time; (2) 30 seconds, 3 times; \r\n[L1607] (3) 30 seconds, 5 times; (4) 90 seconds, 1 time; (5) 90 seconds, \r\n[L1608] 3 times; (6) 90 seconds, 5 times.\r\n[L1609] This example shows how experiments allow us to study the combined effect of \r\n[L1610] several factors. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\n[L1611] not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\n[L1612] commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\n[L1613] interest. But if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers \r\n[L1614] get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. The two-factor experiment in \r\n[L1615] the TV advertising example will help us find out.\r\n[L1616] How to Experiment Badly \r\n[L1617] Experiments are the preferred method for examining the effect of one variable on \r\n[L1618] another. By imposing the specific treatment of interest and controlling other \r\n[L1619] influences, we can pin down cause and effect. Good designs are essential for \r\n[L1620] effective experiments, just as they are for sampling.

This year, budget cuts will allow the school to offer only an \r\n[L1649] online version of the course. Over the past 10 years, the average SAT \r\n[L1650] score of students in the classroom course was 1620. The online group \r\n[L1651] gets an average score of 1780. That\u2019s roughly 10% higher than the long\ufffetime average for those who took the classroom review course. Is the \r\n[L1652] online course more effective?\r\n[L1653] This experiment has a very simple design. A group of subjects (the \r\n[L1654] students) were exposed to a treatment (the online course), and the \r\n[L1655] outcome (SAT scores) was observed. Here is the design:\r\n[L1656] Students \u2192 Online course \u2192 SAT scores\r\n[L1657] A closer look showed that the students in the online review course \r\n[L1658] were quite different from the students who took the classroom course \r\n[L1659] in past years. They had higher GPAs and were taking more AP classes.\r\n[L1660] The effect of online versus in-class instruction is mixed up with the \r\n[L1661] effect of these lurking variables. Maybe the online students earned \r\n[L1662] higher SAT scores because they were smarter to begin with, not \r\n[L1663] because the online course prepared them better. This confounding \r\n[L1664] prevents us from concluding that the online course is more effective than class\uffferoom instruction.\r\n[L1665] Many laboratory experiments use a design like the one in the online SAT course \r\n[L1666] example:\r\n[L1667] Experimental units \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Measure response\r\n[L1668] In the lab environment, simple designs often work well. Field experiments and \r\n[L1669] experiments with animals or people deal with more variable conditions.

Most well-designed experiments compare \r\n[L1675] two or more treatments.\r\n[L1676] Comparison alone isn\u2019t enough to produce results we can trust. If the treat\ufffements are given to groups that differ greatly when the experiment begins, bias will \r\n[L1677] result.

The solution to the problem of bias in sampling is \r\n[L1684] random selection. In experiments, the solution is random assignment.\r\n[L1685] DEFINITION: Random assignment\r\n[L1686] In an experiment, random assignment means that experimental units are assigned to \r\n[L1687] treatments at random, that is, using some sort of chance process.\r\n[L1688] Let\u2019s look at how random assignment can be used to improve the design of the \r\n[L1689] SAT prep course experiment.\r\n[L1690] SAT Prep: Online versus Classroom\r\n[L1691] How random assignment works\r\n[L1692] This year, the high school has enough budget money to compare the \r\n[L1693] online SAT course with traditional classroom instruction. Fifty students \r\n[L1694] have agreed to participate in an experiment comparing the two instruc\ufffetional methods.\r\n[L1695] PROBLEM: Describe how you would randomly assign 25 students to each of the two \r\n[L1696] methods:\r\n[L1697] (a) Using 50 identical slips of paper\r\n[L1698] (b) Using Table D\r\n[L1699] (c) Using technology\r\n[L1700] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1701] (a) The simplest way would be to use the \u201chat method.\u201d Write each subject\u2019s name on \r\n[L1702] one of the slips. Put all the slips in a hat and mix them thoroughly. Draw them out one \r\n[L1703] at a time until you have 25 slips. These 25 students will take the online course. The \r\n[L1704] remaining 25 students will take the classroom course. Alternatively, you could write \r\n[L1705] \u201conline\u201d on 25 of the slips and \u201cclassroom\u201d on the other 25 slips. Then put the slips in \r\n[L1706] a hat and mix them well. Have students come up one by one and (without looking) pick a slip from the \r\n[L1707] hat. This guarantees 25 students per group, with the treatments assigned by chance.\r\n[L1708] (b) We can use the two-step process from random sampling to do the random assignment.\r\n[L1709] Step 1: Label. Give labels 01, 02, 03, . . . , 49, 50 to the subjects in alphabetical order by last \r\n[L1710] name.\r\n[L1711] Step 2: Table.

It is randomized because the sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments by chance. The diagram in Figure 4.4 presents \r\n[L1725] the details: random assignment, the sizes of the groups and which treatment they \r\n[L1726] receive, and the response variable. There are, as we will see later, statistical rea\ufffesons for using treatment groups that are about equal in size. This type of design is \r\n[L1727] called a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1728] 50 volunteer\r\n[L1729] students\r\n[L1730] Random\r\n[L1731] assignment\r\n[L1732] Group 1\r\n[L1733] 25 students\r\n[L1734] Group 2\r\n[L1735] 25 students\r\n[L1736] Compare\r\n[L1737] SAT scores\r\n[L1738] Treatment 2\r\n[L1739] Classroom\r\n[L1740] Treatment 1\r\n[L1741] Online\r\n[L1742] FIGURE 4.4 Outline of a completely randomized design to compare online and classroom \r\n[L1743] instruction.\r\n[L1744] DEFINITION: Completely randomized design\r\n[L1745] In a completely randomized design, the treatments are assigned to all the experimen\ufffetal units completely by chance.\r\n[L1746] Notice that the definition of a completely randomized design does not require \r\n[L1747] that each treatment be assigned to an equal number of experimental units. It does \r\n[L1748] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L1749] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L1750] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L1751] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L1752] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L1753] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L1754] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1755] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L1756] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L1757] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L1758] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L1759] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L1760] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L1761] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L1762] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L1763] than it really is.\r\n[L1764] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments.

The remaining 20 houses will be given \r\n[L1811] information about energy consumption but no way to monitor their usage. At the end of the year, \r\n[L1812] compare how much electricity was used by the homes in the three groups.\r\n[L1813] Why did we include a control group of 20 houses in the energy conservation \r\n[L1814] experiment? The primary purpose of a control group is to provide a baseline for \r\n[L1815] comparing the effects of the other treatments. Without such a comparison group, \r\n[L1816] we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell whether homes with digital displays or charts used less \r\n[L1817] electricity than homes without such aids.\r\n[L1818] Control group\r\n[L1819] For Practice Try Exercise 61\r\n[L1820] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1821] are asked to describe \r\n[L1822] the design of an experi\ufffement on the AP exam, \r\n[L1823] you won\u2019t get full credit \r\n[L1824] for a diagram like Figure \r\n[L1825] 4.5.

You might be thinking that the change \r\n[L1843] in electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\n[L1844] would tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\n[L1845] Suppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\n[L1846] households might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\n[L1847] whether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\n[L1848] confounding?!)\r\n[L1849] Many experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\n[L1850] group that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\n[L1851] an active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\n[L1852] developed drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\n[L1853] work. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\n[L1854] control group.\r\n[L1855] Some experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group. That\u2019s appropriate \r\n[L1856] if researchers simply want to compare the effects of several treatments, and not \r\n[L1857] to determine whether any of them works better than an inactive treatment. For \r\n[L1858] instance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\n[L1859] of paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\n[L1860] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L1861] Music students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately. Can small-group \r\n[L1862] discussions help? The subjects were 29 students preparing for the end-of-semester per\ufffeformance that is an important part of their grade. Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L1863] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L1864] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L1865] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L1866] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L1867] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment. Follow the model of \r\n[L1868] Figure 4.4.\r\n[L1869] 2. Describe how you would carry out the random assignment. Provide enough detail that \r\n[L1870] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L1871] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L1872] Three Principles of \r\n[L1873] Experimental Design\r\n[L1874] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L1875] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L1876] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L1877] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L1878] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1879] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L1880] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L1881] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L1882] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1883] ?\r\n[L1884] THINK\r\n[L1885] ABOUT\r\n[L1886] IT","[L1887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","[L1888] Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L1889] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1890] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L1891] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L1892] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L1893] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L1894] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L1895] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L1896] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L1897] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L1898] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L1899] between the groups.\r\n[L1900] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L1901] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L1902] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L1903] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L1904] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L1905] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L1906] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L1907] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L1908] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L1909] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L1910] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L1911] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L1912] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L1913] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L1914] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L1915] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L1916] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L1917] experiment.\r\n[L1918] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L1919] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L1920] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks? The Phy\ufffesicians\u2019 Health Study was a medical experiment that helped answer this ques\ufffetion. In fact, the Physicians\u2019 Health Study looked at the effects of two drugs: \r\n[L1921] aspirin and beta-carotene. Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\n[L1922] help prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\n[L1923] male physicians. There were two explanatory variables (factors), each having \r\n[L1924] two levels: aspirin (yes or no) and beta-carotene (yes or no). Combinations of \r\n[L1925] Replication","[L1926] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6cc54f74ebd50cc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_36.jpg","size_bytes":62028,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1927] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>","[L1928] 242 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1929] For Practice Try Exercise 67\r\n[L1930] the levels of these factors form the four treatments shown in Figure 4.6. One\ufffefourth of the subjects were assigned at random to each of these treatments.\r\n[L1931] On odd-numbered days, the subjects took either a tablet that contained as\ufffepirin or a dummy pill that looked and tasted like the aspirin but had no \r\n[L1932] active ingredient (a placebo). On even-numbered days, they took either a \r\n[L1933] capsule containing beta-carotene or a placebo. There were several response \r\n[L1934] variables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\n[L1935] other medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\n[L1936] only 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\n[L1937] large enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\n[L1938] attacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\n[L1939] preventing cancer.\r\n[L1940] PROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\n[L1941] design was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\n[L1942] SOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\n[L1943] lurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\n[L1944] treatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\n[L1945] schedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\n[L1946] which subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\n[L1947] helped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\n[L1948] begin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\n[L1949] replication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\n[L1950] the groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\n[L1951] the random assignment.\r\n[L1952] The control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n[L1953] (placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\n[L1954] Experiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L1955] The logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\n[L1956] all the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\n[L1957] that all subjects really are treated identically.\r\n[L1958] If some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\n[L1959] group takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\n[L1960] the subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\n[L1961] experiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\n[L1962] On even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo. Many patients respond favorably to any treatment, even a placebo, perhaps \r\n[L1963] because they trust the doctor. The response to a dummy treatment is called the \r\n[L1964] Placebo\r\n[L1965] Factor 1:\r\n[L1966] Aspirin\r\n[L1967] Factor 2: Beta-carotene\r\n[L1968] Yes\r\n[L1969] Yes No\r\n[L1970] Aspirin Beta-carotene Aspirin Placebo\r\n[L1971] No\r\n[L1972] Placebo Beta-carotene Placebo Placebo\r\n[L1973] FIGURE 4.6 The treatments in the \r\n[L1974] Physicians\u2019 Health Study.","[L1975] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b06f1b5c1816f6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_37.jpg","size_bytes":61000,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1976] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>","[L1977] Section 4.2 Experiments 243\r\n[L1978] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1979] placebo effect. If some subjects did not take any pills, the effect of aspirin or \r\n[L1980] beta-carotene would be confounded with the placebo effect, the effect of simply \r\n[L1981] taking pills.\r\n[L1982] Curing Baldness and Soothing Pain\r\n[L1983] Do placebos work?\r\n[L1984] Want to help balding men keep their hair? Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\n[L1985] that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\n[L1986] heads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n[L1987] 24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\n[L1988] active medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\n[L1989] the pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\n[L1990] significantly less pain.24\r\n[L1991] When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\n[L1992] that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\n[L1993] placebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\n[L1994] treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\n[L1995] enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\n[L1996] place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\n[L1997] The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\n[L1998] their hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\n[L1999] beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\n[L2000] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L2001] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L2002] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L2003] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L2004] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L2005] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L2006] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L2007] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L2008] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L2009] Placebo effect","[L2010] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2011] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>","[L2012] 244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2013] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L2014] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L2015] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L2016] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L2017] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L2018] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L2019] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L2020] the response variable do know.\r\n[L2021] Single-blind\r\n[L2022] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L2023] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L2024] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L2025] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L2026] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L2027] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L2028] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L2029] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\n[L2030] received the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n[L2031] 1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n[L2032] 2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n[L2033] 3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L2034] experiment.\r\n[L2035] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L2036] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L2037] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L2038] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L2039] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L2040] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L2041] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L2042] significant.\r\n[L2043] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L2044] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L2045] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L2046] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L2047] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation.

David Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah \r\n[L2055] designed an experiment to help answer this question. They used 48 un\ufffedergraduate students as subjects. The researchers randomly assigned half \r\n[L2056] of the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\n[L2057] the other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger. One \r\n[L2058] response variable was whether the driver stopped at a rest area that was \r\n[L2059] specified by researchers before the simulation started.

Since \r\n[L2070] we\u2019re assuming that the treatment received won\u2019t change whether each driver \r\n[L2071] stops at the rest area, we use 33 cards to represent drivers who stop and 15 cards \r\n[L2072] to represent those who don\u2019t.

Let\u2019s return \r\n[L2104] to the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\n[L2105] one group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L2106] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L2107] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L2108] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L2109] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L2110] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L2111] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L2112] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L2113] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L2114] response to the treatments.\r\n[L2115] Blocking\r\n[L2116] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L2117] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L2118] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L2119] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L2120] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

The response variable is a cleanli\ufffeness rating on a scale of 0 (very dirty) to 10 (very clean). How \r\n[L2132] should researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water? They could \r\n[L2133] use a completely randomized design and hope that the \r\n[L2134] random assignment distributes the light-colored clothing \r\n[L2135] about evenly between the cold- and warm-water treatment \r\n[L2136] groups.

They control the effects of some outside \r\n[L2181] variables by bringing those variables into the experiment to form the blocks. \r\n[L2182] A randomized block design allows us to draw separate conclusions about each \r\n[L2183] block, for example, about light-colored and dark-colored clothes in the laundry \r\n[L2184] experiment.

A wise experimenter will form blocks based on the most important un\ufffeavoidable sources of variability (lurking variables) among the experimental units. \r\n[L2193] Randomization will then average out the effects of the remaining lurking vari\ufffeables and allow an unbiased comparison of the treatments.

This ignores the differences between men and women, which would probably result in a great \r\n[L2220] deal of variability in responses to the advertising in all three groups.

The idea is to create blocks by matching pairs of similar \r\n[L2262] experimental units. Then we can use chance to decide which member of a pair \r\n[L2263] gets the first treatment. The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L2264] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L2265] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L2266] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L2267] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L2268] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L2269] Matched pairs design\r\n[L2270] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L2271] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L2272] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L2273] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L2274] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L2275] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L2276] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L2277] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L2278] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L2279] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L2280] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L2281] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L2282] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L2283] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L2284] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L2285] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates?

Completely randomized design For the first experiment, you\u2019ll randomly \r\n[L2288] assign half of the students in your class to stand and the other half to sit.

Since you already sat or stood in Step 1, \r\n[L2295] you just need to do the opposite now. As before, everyone should measure their \r\n[L2296] pulses for one minute after completing the treatment (that is, once they are \r\n[L2297] standing or sitting).

Make a dotplot of these differences and cal\ufffeculate their mean. Is there evidence that standing pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2308] 5. What advantage does the matched pairs design have over the completely \r\n[L2309] randomized design?\r\n[L2310] An AP Statistics class with 24 students performed the \u201cGet Your Heart Beating\u201d \r\n[L2311] Activity. We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\n[L2312] EXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\n[L2313] Design determines analysis\r\n[L2314] A Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\n[L2315] randomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\n[L2316] standing group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n[L2317] 68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\n[L2318] higher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\n[L2319] pulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\n[L2320] graph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\n[L2321] standing pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\n[L2322] What about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\n[L2323] Fathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\n[L2324] rates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\n[L2325] difference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n[L2326] 24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\n[L2327] standing pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\n[L2328] evidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\n[L2329] Let\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\n[L2330] that we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\n[L2331] experimental designs. Blocking by subject in the matched pairs design greatly \r\n[L2332] reduced the variability in the response variable. That made it easier to detect \r\n[L2333] the fact that standing causes an increase in pulse rate. With the large amount \r\n[L2334] of variability in the completely randomized design, we were unable to draw \r\n[L2335] such a conclusion.","[L2336] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5c9678406de9a79#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_45.jpg","size_bytes":52515,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2337] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 47 / 75>","[L2338] Section 4.2 Experiments 251\r\n[L2339] Another important lesson to take away from the example is this: the design of the \r\n[L2340] study determines the appropriate method of analysis. For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\n[L2341] dotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\n[L2342] compare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\n[L2343] The following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\n[L2344] analyzing data from an experiment.\r\n[L2345] DATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\n[L2346] Most automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n[L2347] 78% nitrogen.

Could filling automobile tires with nitrogen improve safety, perfor\ufffemance, or both?\r\n[L2349] Consumers Union designed a study to test whether nitrogen-filled tires would \r\n[L2350] maintain pressure better than air-filled tires.

Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\n[L2384] be distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\n[L2385] experiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\n[L2386] actually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\n[L2387] variable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\n[L2388] s In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\n[L2389] is a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\n[L2390] s The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\n[L2391] manner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\n[L2392] principles of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\n[L2393] assignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\n[L2394] s The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\n[L2395] two or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\n[L2396] with other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\n[L2397] s Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\n[L2398] Random assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\n[L2399] chance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\n[L2400] comparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\n[L2401] s Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\n[L2402] reduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\n[L2403] likely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\n[L2404] s Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\n[L2405] neither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\n[L2406] responses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\n[L2407] the other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\n[L2408] s Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\n[L2409] That helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\n[L2410] patients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\n[L2411] they have received an inactive treatment.\r\n[L2412] s In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\n[L2413] individuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\n[L2414] Randomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\n[L2415] helps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\n[L2416] s Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\n[L2417] treatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\n[L2418] treatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\n[L2419] closely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\n[L2420] Summary SECTION 4.2","[L2421] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","[L2423] Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n[L2424] 45.

Researchers began by \r\n[L2428] asking 305 healthy pregnant women to report their \r\n[L2429] chocolate consumption. Six months after birth, the \r\n[L2430] researchers asked mothers to rate their infants\u2019 tem\ufffeperament, including smiling, laughter, and fear.

Learning biology with computers An educator wants \r\n[L2452] to compare the effectiveness of computer software for \r\n[L2453] teaching biology with that of a textbook presentation. \r\n[L2454] She gives a biology pretest to each of a group of high \r\n[L2455] school juniors, then randomly divides them into \r\n[L2456] two groups. One group uses the computer, and the \r\n[L2457] other studies the text.

Cell phones and brain cancer One study of cell \r\n[L2467] phones and the risk of brain cancer looked at a group \r\n[L2468] of 469 people who have brain cancer. The investiga\ufffetors matched each cancer patient with a person of \r\n[L2469] the same age, gender, and race who did not have \r\n[L2470] brain cancer, then asked about the use of cell phones. \r\n[L2471] Result: \u201cOur data suggest that the use of handheld \r\n[L2472] cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain \r\n[L2473] cancer.\u201d32\r\n[L2474] (a) Is this an observational study or an experiment? \r\n[L2475] Justify your answer.\r\n[L2476] (b) Based on this study, would you conclude that cell \r\n[L2477] phones do not increase the risk of brain cancer?

Effects of class size Do smaller classes in elementary \r\n[L2480] school really benefit students in areas such as scores \r\n[L2481] on standardized tests, staying in school, and going on \r\n[L2482] to college? We might do an observational study that \r\n[L2483] compares students who happened to be in smaller \r\n[L2484] and larger classes in their early school years. Identify \r\n[L2485] a lurking variable that may lead to confounding with \r\n[L2486] the effects of small classes. Explain how confounding \r\n[L2487] might occur.\r\n[L2488] 50. Effects of binge drinking A common definition of \r\n[L2489] \u201cbinge drinking\u201d is 5 or more drinks at one sitting for \r\n[L2490] men and 4 or more for women. An observational study \r\n[L2491] finds that students who binge drink have lower average \r\n[L2492] GPA than those who don\u2019t. Identify a lurking variable \r\n[L2493] that may be confounded with the effects of binge \r\n[L2494] drinking.

Growing in the shade Ability to grow in shade may \r\n[L2499] help pines found in the dry forests of Arizona to resist \r\n[L2500] drought. How well do these pines grow in shade? \r\n[L2501] Investigators planted pine seedlings in a greenhouse \r\n[L2502] in either full light, light reduced to 25% of normal \r\n[L2503] by shade cloth, or light reduced to 5% of normal.

Some students \r\n[L2517] will pay a low flat rate. Others will pay higher rates at \r\n[L2518] peak periods and very low rates off-peak. The univer\ufffesity is interested in the amount and time of use and in \r\n[L2519] the effect on the congestion of the network.\r\n[L2520] 53. Improving response rate How can we reduce the \r\n[L2521] rate of refusals in telephone surveys? Most people \r\n[L2522] who answer at all listen to the interviewer\u2019s introduc\ufffetory remarks and then decide whether to continue. \r\n[L2523] One study made telephone calls to randomly selected \r\n[L2524] households to ask opinions about the next election. In \r\n[L2525] some calls, the interviewer gave her name, in others \r\n[L2526] she identified the university she was representing, \r\n[L2527] and in still others she identified both herself and the \r\n[L2528] university. For each type of call, the interviewer either \r\n[L2529] did or did not offer to send a copy of the final survey \r\n[L2530] results to the person interviewed. Do these differences \r\n[L2531] in the introduction affect whether the interview is \r\n[L2532] completed?\r\n[L2533] 54. Eat well and exercise Most American adolescents \r\n[L2534] don\u2019t eat well and don\u2019t exercise enough. Can middle \r\n[L2535] schools increase physical activity among \r\n[L2536] their students? Can they persuade students to eat \r\n[L2537] better? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\n[L2538] intervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\n[L2539] school day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\n[L2540] for healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\n[L2541] school was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention. The \r\n[L2542] investigators observed physical activity and lunchtime \r\n[L2543] consumption of fat.\r\n[L2544] 55. Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\n[L2545] will use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\n[L2546] raise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\n[L2547] either 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n[L2548] 150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\n[L2549] combinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\n[L2550] fabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\n[L2551] for quality.\r\n[L2552] 56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\n[L2553] the increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\n[L2554] they stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\n[L2555] beat of a metronome. The step was either 5.75 or 11.5 \r\n[L2556] inches high and the metronome beat was 14, 21, or \r\n[L2557] 28 steps per minute. Five students stepped at each \r\n[L2558] combination of height and speed.\r\n[L2559] 57. Cocoa and blood flow A study conducted by Nor\ufffeman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham \r\n[L2560] and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, \r\n[L2561] involved 27 healthy people aged 18 to 72. Each \r\n[L2562] subject consumed a cocoa beverage containing 900 \r\n[L2563] milligrams of flavonols (a class of flavonoids) daily \r\n[L2564] for five days. Using a finger cuff, blood flow was mea\ufffesured on the first and fifth days of the study. After five \r\n[L2565] days, researchers measured what they called \u201csignifi\ufffecant improvement\u201d in blood flow and the function of \r\n[L2566] the cells that line the blood vessels.33 What flaw in the \r\n[L2567] design of this experiment makes it impossible to say \r\n[L2568] whether the cocoa really caused the improved blood \r\n[L2569] flow? Explain.\r\n[L2570] 58. Reducing unemployment Will cash bonuses speed \r\n[L2571] the return to work of unemployed people? A state \r\n[L2572] department of labor notes that last year 68% of people \r\n[L2573] who filed claims for unemployment insurance found \r\n[L2574] a new job within 15 weeks. As an experiment, this year \r\n[L2575] the state offers $500 to people filing unemployment \r\n[L2576] claims if they find a job within 15 weeks. The percent \r\n[L2577] who do so increases to 77%. What flaw in the design \r\n[L2578] of this experiment makes it impossible to say whether \r\n[L2579] the bonus really caused the increase? Explain.\r\n[L2580] 59. Layoffs and \u201csurvivor guilt\u201d Workers who survive a \r\n[L2581] layoff of other employees at their location may suffer \r\n[L2582] from \u201csurvivor guilt.\u201d A study of survivor guilt and \r\n[L2583] its effects used as subjects 120 students who were \r\n[L2584] offered an opportunity to earn extra course credit by \r\n[L2585] doing proofreading. Each subject worked in the same \r\n[L2586] cubicle as another student, who was an accomplice \r\n[L2587] of the experimenters. At a break midway through the \r\n[L2588] work, one of three things happened:\r\n[L2589] Treatment 1: The accomplice was told to leave; it was \r\n[L2590] explained that this was because she performed poorly.\r\n[L2591] Treatment 2: It was explained that unforeseen circum\ufffestances meant there was only enough work for one \r\n[L2592] person. By \u201cchance,\u201d the accomplice was chosen to \r\n[L2593] be laid off.\r\n[L2594] Treatment 3: Both students continued to work after \r\n[L2595] the break.\r\n[L2596] The subjects\u2019 work performance after the break \r\n[L2597] was compared with performance before the break.34\r\n[L2598] Describe how you would randomly assign the \r\n[L2599] subjects to the treatments\r\n[L2600] (a) using slips of paper.\r\n[L2601] (b) using Table D.\r\n[L2602] (c) using technology.\r\n[L2603] 60.

Headache relief Doctors identify \u201cchronic tension\ufffetype headaches\u201d as headaches that occur almost \r\n[L2615] daily for at least six months. Can antidepressant \r\n[L2616] medications or stress management training reduce \r\n[L2617] the number and severity of these headaches? Are both \r\n[L2618] together more effective than either alone? Investiga\ufffetors compared four treatments: antidepressant alone, \r\n[L2619] placebo alone, antidepressant plus stress manage\ufffement, and placebo plus stress management.

The changing climate will \r\n[L2634] probably bring more rain to California, but we don\u2019t \r\n[L2635] know whether the additional rain will come during the \r\n[L2636] winter wet season or extend into the long dry season in \r\n[L2637] spring and summer. Kenwyn Suttle of the University \r\n[L2638] of California at Berkeley and his coworkers carried \r\n[L2639] out an experiment to study the effects of more rain in \r\n[L2640] either season. They randomly assigned plots of open \r\n[L2641] grassland to 3 treatments: added water equal to 20% of \r\n[L2642] annual rainfall either during January to March (winter) \r\n[L2643] or during April to June (spring), and no added water \r\n[L2644] (control).

Treating prostate disease A large study used records \r\n[L2654] from Canada\u2019s national health care system to com\ufffepare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate \r\n[L2655] disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery \r\n[L2656] and a new method that does not require surgery. The \r\n[L2657] records described many patients whose doctors had \r\n[L2658] chosen each method.

All the infants received \r\n[L2716] nutritional supplements and help from social workers. \r\n[L2717] Half were also assigned at random to an intensive \r\n[L2718] preschool program.38\r\n[L2719] (a) Explain the purpose of each of the three experi\ufffemental design principles.\r\n[L2720] (b) Describe how each of these principles was used \r\n[L2721] in this study.\r\n[L2722] 68. Killing weeds A biologist would like to determine \r\n[L2723] which of two brands of weed killer is less likely to \r\n[L2724] harm the plants in a garden at the university. Before \r\n[L2725] spraying near the plants, the biologist decides to \r\n[L2726] conduct an experiment using 24 individual plants. \r\n[L2727] Which of the following two plans for randomly \r\n[L2728] assigning the treatments should the biologist use? \r\n[L2729] Why?\r\n[L2730] Plan A: Choose the 12 healthiest-looking plants. \r\n[L2731] Apply Brand X weed killer to all 12 of those plants. \r\n[L2732] Apply Brand Y weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2733] Plan B: Choose 12 of the 24 plants at random. Apply \r\n[L2734] Brand X weed killer to those 12 plants and Brand Y \r\n[L2735] weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2736] 69. Do placebos really work? Researchers in Japan \r\n[L2737] conducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\n[L2738] were extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\n[L2739] each subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\n[L2740] told the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\n[L2741] subject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\n[L2742] was poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\n[L2743] the arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n[L2744] 13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\n[L2745] poison ivy leaf.39\r\n[L2746] (a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n[L2747] (b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\n[L2748] idea of a placebo effect.\r\n[L2749] 70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\n[L2750] chronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\n[L2751] and needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\n[L2752] will be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\n[L2753] percent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n[L2754] (a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\n[L2755] drug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n[L2756] (b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\n[L2757] getting the new drug or a placebo? How would this \r\n[L2758] knowledge probably affect their reactions?\r\n[L2759] 71. Meditation for anxiety An experiment that claimed \r\n[L2760] to show that meditation lowers anxiety proceeded as \r\n[L2761] follows. The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\n[L2762] and rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\n[L2763] were randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\n[L2764] meditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\n[L2765] simply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\n[L2766] the experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\n[L2767] and rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\n[L2768] now had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\n[L2769] Explain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\n[L2770] could bias the reported results.\r\n[L2771] 72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\n[L2772] testosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\n[L2773] cause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\n[L2774] fat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\n[L2775] supplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\n[L2776] in the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\n[L2777] with low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\n[L2778] a testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\n[L2779] in the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\n[L2780] described the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\n[L2781] placebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\n[L2782] terms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n[L2783] 73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\n[L2784] determine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\n[L2785] acupuncture could help infertile women become \r\n[L2786] pregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\n[L2787] undergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\n[L2788] were recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\n[L2789] randomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n[L2790] 25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\n[L2791] minutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\n[L2792] were instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\n[L2793] embryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n[L2794] 34 women became pregnant. In the control group, \r\n[L2795] 21 women became pregnant.\r\n[L2796] (a) Describe how the three principles of experimen\ufffetal design were addressed in this study.\r\n[L2797] (b) The difference in the percent of women who \r\n[L2798] became pregnant in the two groups is statistically \r\n[L2799] significant. Explain what this means to someone who \r\n[L2800] knows little statistics.\r\n[L2801] (c) Explain why the placebo effect prevents us from \r\n[L2802] concluding that acupuncture caused the difference in \r\n[L2803] pregnancy rates.\r\n[L2804] pg 241","[L2805] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>","[L2806] Section 4.2 Experiments 257\r\n[L2807] 74. Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\n[L2808] colleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\n[L2809] Half of the participants were randomly assigned \r\n[L2810] to a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\n[L2811] assigned to a low-fat diet. Researchers measured each \r\n[L2812] participant\u2019s change in weight and cholesterol level \r\n[L2813] after six months and again after one year. Subjects in \r\n[L2814] the low-carb diet group lost significantly more weight \r\n[L2815] than subjects in the low-fat diet group during the first \r\n[L2816] six months of the study. At the end of a year, however, \r\n[L2817] the average weight loss for subjects in the two groups \r\n[L2818] was not significantly different.42\r\n[L2819] (a) Why did researchers randomly assign the subjects \r\n[L2820] to the diet treatments?\r\n[L2821] (b) Explain to someone who knows little statistics \r\n[L2822] what \u201clost significantly more weight\u201d means.\r\n[L2823] (c) The subjects in the low-carb diet group lost an aver\ufffeage of 5.1 kg in a year. The subjects in the low-fat diet \r\n[L2824] group lost an average of 3.1 kg. Explain how this infor\ufffemation could be consistent with the fact that weight loss \r\n[L2825] in the two groups was not significantly different.\r\n[L2826] 75. Is yawning contagious? According to the popular \r\n[L2827] TV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\n[L2828] March 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\n[L2829] presented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\n[L2830] subjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\n[L2831] an extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\n[L2832] camera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\n[L2833] seed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\n[L2834] yawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\n[L2835] who had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\n[L2836] given a yawn seed, 10 yawned. Adam Savage and Ja\ufffemie Hyneman, the cohosts of Mythbusters, used these \r\n[L2837] results to conclude that yawning is contagious.\r\n[L2838] (a) Explain how you could use slips of paper to ran\ufffedomly reassign the subjects to the treatment groups.\r\n[L2839] (b) Suppose we used your method in (a) to redo the \r\n[L2840] random assignment 50 times.

The researchers decided to \r\n[L2846] analyze the patients\u2019 final pain ratings. It also makes \r\n[L2847] sense to examine the difference between patients\u2019 \r\n[L2848] initial pain ratings and their final pain ratings in both \r\n[L2849] groups. Here are the data:\r\n[L2850] Active: 10, 6, 1, 10, 6, 8, 5, 5, 6, 8, 7, 8, 7, 6, 4, 4, 7, 10, 6, 10, 6, 5, 5, 1, \r\n[L2851] 0, 0, 0, 0, 1\r\n[L2852] Inactive: 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1\r\n[L2853] (a) Construct a comparative dotplot of the data. \r\n[L2854] Describe what you see.\r\n[L2855] (b) Calculate the mean (average) change in pain \r\n[L2856] rating for each group.

Doctors and nurses Nurse-practitioners are nurses \r\n[L2864] with advanced qualifications who often act much like \r\n[L2865] primary-care physicians. Are they as effective as \r\n[L2866] doctors at treating patients with chronic conditions? \r\n[L2867] An experiment was conducted with 1316 patients \r\n[L2868] who had been diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, or \r\n[L2869] high blood pressure. Within each condition, patients \r\n[L2870] were randomly assigned to either a doctor or a \r\n[L2871] nurse-practitioner. The response variables included \r\n[L2872] measures of the patients\u2019 health and of their \r\n[L2873] satisfaction with their medical care after 6 months.43\r\n[L2874] (a) Which are the blocks in this experiment: the \r\n[L2875] different diagnoses (asthma, etc.) or the type of care \r\n[L2876] (nurse or doctor)?

Comparing cancer treatments The progress of a \r\n[L2881] type of cancer differs in women and men. Researchers \r\n[L2882] want to design an experiment to compare three thera\ufffepies for this cancer.

In the cornfield An agriculture researcher wants to \r\n[L2895] compare the yield of 5 corn varieties: A, B, C, D, and \r\n[L2896] E. The field in which the experiment will be carried \r\n[L2897] out increases in fertility from north to south. The \r\n[L2898] researcher therefore divides the field into 25 plots \r\n[L2899] of equal size, arranged in 5 east\u2013west rows of 5 plots \r\n[L2900] each, as shown in the diagram.\r\n[L2901] North\r\n[L2902] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2903] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2904] setting.\r\n[L2905] (b) Should the researcher use the rows or the \r\n[L2906] columns of the field as blocks?

Comparing weight-loss treatments Twenty over\ufffeweight females have agreed to participate in a study \r\n[L2911] of the effectiveness of four weight-loss treatments: \r\n[L2912] A, B, C, and D. The researcher first calculates how \r\n[L2913] overweight each subject is by comparing the subject\u2019s \r\n[L2914] actual weight with her \u201cideal\u201d weight. The subjects \r\n[L2915] and their excess weights in pounds are as follows:\r\n[L2916] Birnbaum 35 Hernandez 25 Moses 25 Smith 29\r\n[L2917] Brown 34 Jackson 33 Nevesky 39 Stall 33\r\n[L2918] Brunk 30 Kendall 28 Obrach 30 Tran 35\r\n[L2919] Cruz 34 Loren 32 Rodriguez 30 Wilansky 42\r\n[L2920] Deng 24 Mann 28 Santiago 27 Williams 22\r\n[L2921] The response variable is the weight lost after 8 weeks of \r\n[L2922] treatment. Previous studies have shown that the effects \r\n[L2923] of a diet may vary based on a subject\u2019s initial weight.\r\n[L2924] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2925] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2926] setting.\r\n[L2927] (b) Should researchers form blocks of size 4 based on \r\n[L2928] subjects\u2019 last names in alphabetical order or by how \r\n[L2929] overweight the subjects are? Explain.\r\n[L2930] (c) Use technology or Table D to carry out the \r\n[L2931] random assignment required by your design. Explain \r\n[L2932] your method clearly.\r\n[L2933] 81. Aw, rats! A nutrition experimenter intends to \r\n[L2934] compare the weight gain of newly weaned male \r\n[L2935] rats fed Diet A with that of rats fed Diet B. To do this, \r\n[L2936] she will feed each diet to 10 rats. She has available \r\n[L2937] 10 rats from one litter and 10 rats from a second \r\n[L2938] litter. Rats in the first litter appear to be slightly \r\n[L2939] healthier.\r\n[L2940] (a) If the 10 rats from Litter 1 were fed Diet A, the \r\n[L2941] effects of genetics and diet would be confounded, and \r\n[L2942] the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A. \r\n[L2943] Explain this statement carefully.\r\n[L2944] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2945] 82. Technology for teaching statistics The Brigham \r\n[L2946] Young University (BYU) statistics department is \r\n[L2947] performing experiments to compare teaching meth\ufffeods. Response variables include students\u2019 final-exam \r\n[L2948] scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. \r\n[L2949] One study compares two levels of technology for large \r\n[L2950] lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) \r\n[L2951] and multimedia. There are 8 lecture sections of a \r\n[L2952] basic statistics course at BYU, each with about 200 \r\n[L2953] students. There are four instructors, each of whom \r\n[L2954] teaches two sections.44 Suppose the sections and \r\n[L2955] lecturers are as follows:\r\n[L2956] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2957] 1 Hilton\r\n[L2958] 2 Christensen\r\n[L2959] 3 Hadfield\r\n[L2960] 4 Hadfield\r\n[L2961] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2962] 5 Tolley\r\n[L2963] 6 Hilton\r\n[L2964] 7 Tolley\r\n[L2965] 8 Christensen\r\n[L2966] (a) Suppose we randomly assign two lecturers to use \r\n[L2967] standard technology in their sections and the other \r\n[L2968] two lecturers to use multimedia technology.

Chocolate gets my heart pumping Cardiologists \r\n[L3000] at Athens Medical School in Greece wanted to test \r\n[L3001] whether chocolate affected blood flow in the blood \r\n[L3002] vessels. The researchers recruited 17 healthy young \r\n[L3003] volunteers, who were each given a 3.5-ounce bar of \r\n[L3004] dark chocolate, either bittersweet or fake chocolate. \r\n[L3005] On another day, the volunteers were switched. The \r\n[L3006] subjects had no chocolate outside the study, and \r\n[L3007] investigators didn\u2019t know whether a subject had eaten \r\n[L3008] the real or the fake chocolate. An ultrasound was \r\n[L3009] taken of each volunteer\u2019s upper arm to see the func\ufffetioning of the cells in the walls of the main artery. \r\n[L3010] The investigators found that blood vessel function was \r\n[L3011] improved when the subjects ate bittersweet chocolate, \r\n[L3012] and that there were no such changes when they ate \r\n[L3013] the placebo (fake chocolate).45\r\n[L3014] (a) What type of design did the investigators use in \r\n[L3015] their study?\r\n[L3016] (b) Explain why the investigators chose this design \r\n[L3017] instead of a completely randomized design.\r\n[L3018] (c) Why is it important to randomly assign the order \r\n[L3019] of the treatments for the subjects?\r\n[L3020] 85. Room temperature and dexterity An expert on \r\n[L3021] worker performance is interested in the effect of \r\n[L3022] room temperature on the performance of tasks \r\n[L3023] requiring manual dexterity. She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\n[L3024] variable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\n[L3025] a 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\n[L3026] requires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\n[L3027] subject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\n[L3028] make as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\n[L3029] continuous effort.\r\n[L3030] (a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\n[L3031] compare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\n[L3032] available.\r\n[L3033] (b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\n[L3034] wide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\n[L3035] subjects in each group. Describe in detail the design \r\n[L3036] of a matched pairs experiment in which each subject \r\n[L3037] serves as his or her own control.\r\n[L3038] 86. Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\n[L3039] of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\n[L3040] increasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\n[L3041] Because plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\n[L3042] CO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\n[L3043] An elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\n[L3044] CO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\n[L3045] the growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\n[L3046] untreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\n[L3047] growth. We can afford to treat three circular areas.46\r\n[L3048] (a) Describe the design of a completely randomized \r\n[L3049] experiment using 6 well-separated 30-meter circular \r\n[L3050] areas in a pine forest. Sketch the circles and carry out \r\n[L3051] the randomization your design calls for.\r\n[L3052] (b) Areas within the forest may differ in soil fertility. \r\n[L3053] Describe a matched pairs design using three pairs \r\n[L3054] of circles that will reduce the extra variation due to \r\n[L3055] different fertility. Sketch the circles and carry out the \r\n[L3056] randomization your design calls for.\r\n[L3057] 87. Got deodorant? A group of students wants to per\ufffeform an experiment to determine whether Brand A or \r\n[L3058] Brand B deodorant lasts longer. One group member \r\n[L3059] suggests the following design: Recruit 40 student \r\n[L3060] volunteers\u201420 male and 20 female.

Can changing diet reduce high blood pressure? \r\n[L3098] Vegetarian diets and low-salt diets are both promising. \r\n[L3099] Men with high blood pressure are assigned at random \r\n[L3100] to four diets: (1) normal diet with unrestricted salt; \r\n[L3101] (2) vegetarian with unrestricted salt; (3) normal with \r\n[L3102] restricted salt; and (4) vegetarian with restricted salt. \r\n[L3103] This experiment has\r\n[L3104] (a) one factor, the type of diet.\r\n[L3105] (b) two factors, high blood pressure and type of diet.\r\n[L3106] (c) two factors, normal/vegetarian diet and unre\ufffestricted/restricted salt.\r\n[L3107] (d) three factors, men, high blood pressure, and type \r\n[L3108] of diet.\r\n[L3109] (e) four factors, the four diets being compared.\r\n[L3110] 92.

Is this \r\n[L3152] good evidence that ibuprofen is effective in prevent\ufffeing Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\r\n[L3153] (a) Yes, because the study was a randomized, \r\n[L3154] comparative experiment.\r\n[L3155] (b) No, because the effect of ibuprofen is confounded \r\n[L3156] with the placebo effect.\r\n[L3157] (c) Yes, because the results were published in a \r\n[L3158] reputable professional journal.\r\n[L3159] (d) No, because this is an observational study.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L3219] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L3220] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L3221] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L3222] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L3223] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L3224] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3225] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L3226] on the design of the study.\r\n[L3227] Scope of Inference\r\n[L3228] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L3229] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L3230] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L3231] results of the sample.\r\n[L3232] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L3233] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L3234] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L3235] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L3236] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L3237] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L3238] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L3239] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L3240] 4.3\r\n[L3241] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","[L3242] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3243] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","[L3244] 262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3245] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L3246] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L3247] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L3248] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L3249] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L3250] Yes No\r\n[L3251] Were individuals \r\n[L3252] randomly selected?\r\n[L3253] Yes\r\n[L3254] Inference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\n[L3255] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3256] No Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\n[L3257] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3258] Well-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\n[L3259] However, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\n[L3260] larger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\n[L3261] effect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\n[L3262] rules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\n[L3263] random sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\n[L3264] example illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\n[L3265] EXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\n[L3266] Determining scope of inference\r\n[L3267] A small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\n[L3268] The dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\n[L3269] Design 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3270] to take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L3271] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L3272] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L3273] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L3274] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3275] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L3276] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3277] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3278] part in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3279] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3280] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L3281] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3282] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L3283] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L3284] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L3285] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L3286] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L3287] SOLUTION:\r\n[L3288] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L3289] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments ","[L3290] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a9a2c4c5c24a51b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_57.jpg","size_bytes":59616,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3291] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>","[L3292] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L3293] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3294] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L3295] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L3296] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L3297] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L3298] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L3299] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L3300] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L3301] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L3302] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L3303] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L3304] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L3305] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L3306] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L3307] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L3308] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L3309] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L3310] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L3311] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L3312] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L3313] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L3314] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L3315] the town.\r\n[L3316] The Challenges of \r\n[L3317] Establishing Causation\r\n[L3318] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L3319] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L3320] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L3321] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L3322] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L3323] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L3324] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\n[L3325] Lack of realism\r\n[L3326] Do those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3327] since 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\n[L3328] showed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\n[L3329] But requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\n[L3330] What happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\n[L3331] all cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\n[L3332] For Practice Try Exercise 105","[L3333] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3334] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","[L3335] 264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3336] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3337] In some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\n[L3338] these important questions:\r\n[L3339] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L3340] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L3341] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L3342] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L3343] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L3344] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L3345] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L3346] studies.\r\n[L3347] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L3348] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L3349] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L3350] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L3351] Living with observational studies\r\n[L3352] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L3353] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L3354] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L3355] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L3356] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L3357] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L3358] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L3359] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L3360] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L3361] experiment?\r\n[L3362] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L3363] very strong.\r\n[L3364] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L3365] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L3366] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L3367] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L3368] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L3369] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L3370] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L3371] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L3372] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L3373] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L3374] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L3375] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L3376] cancer death among women.","[L3377] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3378] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","[L3379] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L3380] sThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\n[L3381] cigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\n[L3382] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L3383] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3384] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L3385] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L3386] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L3387] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\n[L3388] observational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\n[L3389] Data Ethics*\r\n[L3390] Medical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\n[L3391] Shouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\n[L3392] reasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L3393] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L3394] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L3395] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L3396] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L3397] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L3398] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L3399] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L3400] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L3401] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L3402] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L3403] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\n[L3404] knows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\n[L3405] the physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\n[L3406] sWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L3407] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L3408] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L3409] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L3410] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L3411] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\n[L3412] are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\n[L3413] data from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\n[L3414] Basic Data Ethics\r\n[L3415] All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\n[L3416] board charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\n[L3417] All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\n[L3418] before data are collected.\r\n[L3419] All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\n[L3420] groups of subjects may be made public.\r\n[L3421] *This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","[L3422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","[L3423] 266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3424] The law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\n[L3425] obey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\n[L3426] Institutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\n[L3427] to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\n[L3428] it is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\n[L3429] board, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\n[L3430] recruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\n[L3431] study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\n[L3432] are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\n[L3433] research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\n[L3434] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L3435] boards.\r\n[L3436] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L3437] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L3438] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L3439] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L3440] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L3441] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L3442] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L3443] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L3444] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L3445] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L3446] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L3447] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L3448] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L3449] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L3450] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity. Anonym\ufffeity means that individuals are anonymous\u2014their names ","[L3451] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 63 / 75>","[L3452] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 267\r\n[L3453] are not known even to the director of the study. Anonymity is rare in statistical stud\ufffeies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it \r\n[L3454] prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform individuals of results.\r\n[L3455] Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L3456] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L3457] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L3458] other identification have been removed from the data available for search. Privacy \r\n[L3459] and confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the computer age.\r\n[L3460] ACTIVITY Response bias\r\n[L3461] In this Activity, your team will design and conduct an experiment to investigate \r\n[L3462] the effects of response bias in surveys.53 You may choose the topic for your sur\ufffeveys, but you must design your experiment so that it can answer at least one of the \r\n[L3463] following questions:\r\n[L3464] sCan the wording of a question create response bias?\r\n[L3465] sDo the characteristics of the interviewer create response bias?\r\n[L3466] sDoes anonymity change the responses to sensitive questions?\r\n[L3467] sDoes manipulating the answer choices change the response?\r\n[L3468] 1. Write a proposal describing the design of your experiment. Be sure to \r\n[L3469] include\r\n[L3470] (a) your chosen topic and which of the above questions you\u2019ll try to answer.\r\n[L3471] (b) a detailed description of how you will obtain your subjects (minimum of \r\n[L3472] 50). Your plan must be practical!\r\n[L3473] (c) what your questions will be and how they will be asked.\r\n[L3474] (d) a clear explanation of how you will implement your design.\r\n[L3475] (e) precautions you will take to collect data ethically.\r\n[L3476] Here are two examples of successful student projects:\r\n[L3477] \u201cMake-Up,\u201d by Caryn S. and Trisha T.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L3496] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L3497] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L3498] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L3499] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L3500] results.\r\n[L3501] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L3502] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L3503] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L3504] lurking variables.\r\n[L3505] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L3506] review board. All participants must give their informed consent before \r\n[L3507] taking part. Any information about the individuals in the study must be \r\n[L3508] kept confidential.\r\n[L3509] s Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions \r\n[L3510] that can\u2019t be answered without them. Also remember that \u201cthe interests of \r\n[L3511] the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\u201d54\r\n[L3512] Summary SECTION 4.3\r\n[L3513] Magnets and Pain\r\n[L3514] Let\u2019s return to the chapter-opening Case Study (page 205). Researchers carried \r\n[L3515] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L3516] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\n[L3517] dotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\n[L3518] magnet).\r\n[L3519] The average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\n[L3520] and 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\n[L3521] significant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\n[L3522] The difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\n[L3523] too large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain. But since the subjects were volunteers, we can\u2019t \r\n[L3524] safely generalize the findings of this experiment to any larger \r\n[L3525] population.\r\n[L3526] case closed","[L3527] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 65 / 75>","[L3528] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 269\r\n[L3529] 102.

Foster care versus orphanages Do abandoned \r\n[L3534] children placed in foster homes do better than \r\n[L3535] similar children placed in an institution? The \r\n[L3536] Bucharest Early Intervention Project found that \r\n[L3537] the answer is a clear \u201cYes.\u201d The subjects were 136 \r\n[L3538] young children abandoned at birth and living in \r\n[L3539] orphanages in Bucharest, Romania. Half of the \r\n[L3540] children, chosen at random, were placed in foster \r\n[L3541] homes. The other half remained in the orphanages.55\r\n[L3542] (Foster care was not easily available in Romania at \r\n[L3543] the time and so was paid for by the study.)

At the end of that time \r\n[L3552] period, each battery\u2019s charge is tested. Result:\r\n[L3553] Batteries stored in the freezer had a higher average \r\n[L3554] charge, and the difference between the groups was \r\n[L3555] statistically significant.

According to \r\n[L3558] Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain,\r\n[L3559] women say nearly three times as many words per day \r\n[L3560] as men. Skeptical researchers devised a study to test \r\n[L3561] this claim. They used electronic devices to record \r\n[L3562] the talking patterns of 396 university students who \r\n[L3563] volunteered to participate in the study. The device \r\n[L3564] was programmed to record 30 seconds of sound \r\n[L3565] every 12.5 minutes without the carrier\u2019s knowledge. \r\n[L3566] According to a published report of the study in \r\n[L3567] Scientific American, \u201cMen showed a slightly wider \r\n[L3568] variability in words uttered.... But in the end, the \r\n[L3569] sexes came out just about even in the daily averages: \r\n[L3570] women at 16,215 words and men at 15,669.\u201d56 This \r\n[L3571] difference was not statistically significant.

One of the better \r\n[L3574] studies of the effect of regular attendance at religious \r\n[L3575] services gathered data from a random sample of \r\n[L3576] 3617 adults. The researchers then measured lots of \r\n[L3577] variables, not just the explanatory variable (religious \r\n[L3578] activities) and the response variable (length of life). \r\n[L3579] A news article said: \u201cChurchgoers were more likely \r\n[L3580] to be nonsmokers, physically active, and at their \r\n[L3581] right weight. But even after health behaviors were \r\n[L3582] taken into account, those not attending religious \r\n[L3583] services regularly still were about 25% more likely to \r\n[L3584] have died.\u201d57 What conclusion can we draw from \r\n[L3585] this study? Explain.\r\n[L3586] 107. Daytime running lights Canada requires that cars \r\n[L3587] be equipped with \u201cdaytime running lights,\u201d \r\n[L3588] headlights that automatically come on at a low \r\n[L3589] level when the car is started. Some manufacturers \r\n[L3590] are now equipping cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3591] with running lights. Will running lights reduce \r\n[L3592] accidents by making cars more visible?

Studying frustration A psychologist wants to study \r\n[L3598] the effects of failure and frustration on the \r\n[L3599] relationships among members of a work team. \r\n[L3600] She forms a team of students, brings them to the \r\n[L3601] psychology lab, and has them play a game that \r\n[L3602] requires teamwork. The game is rigged so that they \r\n[L3603] lose regularly. The psychologist observes the students \r\n[L3604] through a one-way window and notes the changes in \r\n[L3605] their behavior during an evening of game playing. \r\n[L3606] Can the psychologist generalize the results of her \r\n[L3607] study to a team of employees that spends months \r\n[L3608] developing a new product that never works right and \r\n[L3609] is finally abandoned by their company?

The researchers \r\n[L3684] argued that almost all children in the institution \r\n[L3685] quickly became infected anyway. The studies \r\n[L3686] showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis \r\n[L3687] existed. This finding contributed to the development \r\n[L3688] of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, \r\n[L3689] the Willowbrook studies are now considered an \r\n[L3690] example of unethical research. Explain why, \r\n[L3691] according to current ethical standards, useful results \r\n[L3692] are not enough to allow a study.\r\n[L3693] 116.* Unequal benefits Researchers on aging proposed to \r\n[L3694] investigate the effect of supplemental health services \r\n[L3695] on the quality of life of older people. Eligible \r\n[L3696] patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to \r\n[L3697] be randomly assigned to treatment and control \r\n[L3698] groups.

Ugly fries Few people want to eat discolored \r\n[L3851] french fries. Potatoes are kept refrigerated before being \r\n[L3852] cut for french fries to prevent spoiling and preserve flavor. \r\n[L3853] But immediate processing of cold potatoes causes discol\ufffeoring due to complex chemical reactions. The potatoes \r\n[L3854] must therefore be brought to room temperature before \r\n[L3855] processing. Researchers want to design an experiment in \r\n[L3856] which tasters will rate the color and flavor of french fries \r\n[L3857] prepared from several groups of potatoes. The potatoes \r\n[L3858] will be freshly picked or stored for a month at room tem\ufffeperature or stored for a month refrigerated. They will then \r\n[L3859] be sliced and cooked either immediately or after an hour \r\n[L3860] at room temperature.

A well-designed experiment is designed to make causation plausible by controlling (as much as possible) everything except the treatment(s).\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{example}[Why observational comparisons can mislead (numbers)]\nSuppose we compare two groups:\n\\[\n\\text{Supplement users: } n=100,\\ \\text{heart attacks }=4;\n\\qquad\n\\text{Nonusers: } n=100,\\ \\text{heart attacks }=8.\n\\]\nAt first glance, the supplement group looks ``better.'' But suppose 80\\% of users also exercise regularly while only 30\\% of nonusers do. If exercise reduces heart-attack risk, then the supplement and exercise effects are mixed together. Without design features to separate them, we cannot attribute the difference (4\\% vs 8\\%) to the supplement.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{Lurking variables and confounding}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Lurking variable]\nA \\emph{lurking variable} is a variable not among the explanatory or response variables in the study that may influence the response.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Confounding]\n\\emph{Confounding} occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[How to justify a confounder on exams]\nTo argue that a variable $Z$ is a plausible confounder for the relationship between explanatory variable $X$ and response $Y$, explain:\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\roman*)]\n\\item $Z$ is associated with $X$ (it differs systematically across the groups defined by $X$), and\n\\item $Z$ affects $Y$ (it has a plausible/known effect on the response).\n\\end{enumerate}\nIf (i) fails, confounding by $Z$ cannot occur.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\section{The language of experiments}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Treatment; experimental unit; subject]\nA \\emph{treatment} is a specific condition applied in an experiment.\nThe \\emph{experimental units} are the smallest units to which treatments are applied.\nWhen the units are human beings, they are often called \\emph{subjects}.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Explanatory variable (factor) and level]\nIn experiments, explanatory variables are often called \\emph{factors}. A \\emph{level} is a particular value of a factor. A \\emph{treatment} is formed by combining one level from each factor.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Counting treatments in factorial experiments]\nIf factor $A$ has $a$ levels and factor $B$ has $b$ levels, then a full-factorial design has\n\\[\na\\times b\n\\]\ntreatments. With $k$ factors having $l_1,l_2,\\dots,l_k$ levels respectively, the number of treatments is $\\prod_{j=1}^k l_j$.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{example}[Factor/level/treatment counting]\nFactor $A$ (ad length) has levels $\\{30\\text{s},\\,90\\text{s}\\}$ (2 levels).\nFactor $B$ (repetitions) has levels $\\{1,3,5\\}$ (3 levels).\nThere are $2\\times 3=6$ treatments:\n\\[\n(30\\text{s},1),(30\\text{s},3),(30\\text{s},5),(90\\text{s},1),(90\\text{s},3),(90\\text{s},5).\n\\]\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{How to experiment badly}\n\n\\begin{remark}[One-group designs are fragile]\nA design of the form\n\\[\n\\text{Units} \\longrightarrow \\text{Treatment} \\longrightarrow \\text{Measure response}\n\\]\noften fails outside a tightly controlled lab, because there is no comparison group. Without comparison, it is hard to separate treatment effects from other time-varying influences (weather, learning, seasonality, etc.).\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{example}[Comparing to ``the past'' is not a good control]\nA school runs an online SAT prep course this year and compares the mean SAT score of this year's online group to the 10-year historical average of an in-class course. If the online group differs in prior GPA, motivation, course load, etc., then the effect of the course is confounded with pre-existing differences between the groups.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{How to experiment well: randomized comparative experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Random assignment and comparative design}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Comparative experiment; randomized comparative experiment]\nA \\emph{comparative experiment} compares two or more treatments.\nA \\emph{randomized comparative experiment} assigns experimental units to treatments using chance (random assignment).\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Random assignment]\n\\emph{Random assignment} means that experimental units are assigned to treatments using a chance process.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Random assignment vs random sampling]\nRandom \\emph{assignment} helps justify inference about \\emph{cause-and-effect}.\nRandom \\emph{sampling} helps justify inference about a \\emph{population}.\nThese are different ideas; do not mix their terminology.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection{Completely randomized design}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Completely randomized design (CRD)]\nIn a \\emph{completely randomized design}, treatments are assigned to all experimental units completely by chance.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{example}[CRD with three treatments (numbers and procedure)]\nSuppose $N=60$ households and three treatments:\n\\[\nT_1=\\text{digital display},\\quad T_2=\\text{chart+info},\\quad T_3=\\text{control}.\n\\]\nA standard CRD approach is:\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\arabic*.]\n\\item Label households $1,2,\\dots,60$.\n\\item Randomly assign 20 labels to $T_1$, 20 to $T_2$, remaining 20 to $T_3$.\n\\item Measure annual electricity use $Y$ and compare group means.\n\\end{enumerate}\nIf the yearly electricity-use totals (in kWh) have group means\n\\[\n\\bar{Y}_1=4100,\\quad \\bar{Y}_2=4300,\\quad \\bar{Y}_3=4700,\n\\]\nthen estimated treatment effects relative to control are\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\Delta}_{1-3}=\\bar{Y}_1-\\bar{Y}_3=4100-4700=-600,\n\\qquad\n\\widehat{\\Delta}_{2-3}=\\bar{Y}_2-\\bar{Y}_3=4300-4700=-400.\n\\]\nNegative here means ``less electricity used'' relative to control.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\subsection{Control groups}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Control group]\nA \\emph{control group} is a baseline group used for comparison. It may receive an inactive treatment (placebo/no special intervention) or an active standard treatment, depending on the study goal.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Why a control group matters]\nEven if a treated group improves compared to its own past, outside influences (weather, time trends, learning, maturation) can create changes. A control group helps ensure that such influences are experienced similarly across groups, reducing confounding.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\section{Three principles of experimental design}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Principles of experimental design]\nThe three core principles are:\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\arabic*.]\n\\item \\textbf{Control:} use a comparative design and keep conditions the same except for treatments.\n\\item \\textbf{Random assignment:} use chance to assign units to treatments to balance lurking variables.\n\\item \\textbf{Replication:} use enough units per treatment to distinguish treatment effects from chance variation.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{example}[Replication and effect sizes (simple arithmetic)]\nSuppose two treatments produce mean responses differing by 5 units.\nWith $n=1$ per group, a single unusual subject can create or hide a 5-unit difference.\nWith $n=50$ per group, individual variation tends to average out, and a real 5-unit effect is easier to detect.\n(Precise inference is later handled via statistical tests/simulation.)\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{Placebos and blinding}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Placebo effect; placebo-controlled]\nThe \\emph{placebo effect} is a response caused by receiving a dummy treatment or expecting a treatment to work.\nA study is \\emph{placebo-controlled} if a control group receives a placebo so that merely ``taking a treatment'' is not confounded with the active ingredient.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Single-blind; double-blind]\n\\emph{Single-blind:} one party (either subjects or evaluators) does not know which treatment a subject received.\n\\emph{Double-blind:} neither the subjects nor those who interact with them and measure responses know which treatment a subject received.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{example}[Placebo arithmetic (toy numbers)]\nSuppose $n=100$ receive a placebo and $n=100$ receive a new drug.\nIf 42 placebo subjects improve and 86 drug subjects improve, then\n\\[\n\\hat p_{\\text{placebo}}=0.42,\\qquad \\hat p_{\\text{drug}}=0.86,\\qquad\n\\widehat{\\Delta}_p=\\hat p_{\\text{drug}}-\\hat p_{\\text{placebo}}=0.44.\n\\]\nThe drug appears to outperform placebo by 44 percentage points in this sample.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{Inference for experiments and statistical significance}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Statistically significant]\nAn observed effect is \\emph{statistically significant} if it would rarely occur by chance alone (under the randomness of assignment) when there is no real treatment effect.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\subsection{Estimating treatment effects (core formulas)}\nFor a quantitative response:\n\\[\n\\bar y = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i,\\qquad \\widehat{\\Delta}=\\bar y_1-\\bar y_2.\n\\]\nFor a binary response:\n\\[\n\\hat p=\\frac{x}{n},\\qquad \\widehat{\\Delta}_p=\\hat p_1-\\hat p_2.\n\\]\n\n\\begin{example}[Difference in proportions: distracted driving]\n48 drivers are randomly assigned: 24 talk on a cell phone, 24 talk to a passenger.\nOutcome: ``failed to stop at a rest area.''\n\\[\n\\hat p_{\\text{cell}}=\\frac{12}{24}=0.50,\\qquad\n\\hat p_{\\text{pass}}=\\frac{3}{24}=0.125,\n\\]\nso\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\Delta}_p=0.50-0.125=0.375.\n\\]\nA randomization (simulation) test asks: if treatment truly had no effect, how often would random reassignment produce a difference at least as large as 0.375?\n\\end{example}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Optional exact probability (hypergeometric)]\nUnder the ``no effect'' assumption, the set of 15 ``didn't stop'' outcomes is fixed and 24 of the 48 are assigned to the cell-phone group at random. Then\n\\[\nX=\\#(\\text{didn't stop in cell-phone group}) \\sim \\mathrm{Hypergeometric}(N=48, K=15, n=24),\n\\]\nso\n\\[\n\\PP(X\\ge 12)=\\sum_{k=12}^{15}\\frac{\\binom{15}{k}\\binom{33}{24-k}}{\\binom{48}{24}}.\n\\]\nIn practice, simulation approximates this probability.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\section{Blocking and randomized block designs}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Block; randomized block design]\nA \\emph{block} is a group of experimental units known (before the experiment) to be similar in a way expected to affect the response.\nIn a \\emph{randomized block design}, random assignment to treatments is carried out separately within each block.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Rule of thumb]\n\\emph{Control what you can, block on what you can't control, and randomize to create comparable groups.}\nBlocking typically reduces variability and increases the chance of detecting real treatment effects.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{example}[Blocking for laundry detergent (numbers and working)]\nTreatments: warm water (W) vs cold water (C).\nBlock by color because color affects cleanliness scores.\n\nLight clothes (6 items): randomly assign 3 to W, 3 to C.\nSuppose cleanliness scores (0--10) are:\n\\[\n\\text{Light-W: } 9,8,9 \\quad (\\bar y_{LW}=8.67),\\qquad\n\\text{Light-C: } 8,7,8 \\quad (\\bar y_{LC}=7.67).\n\\]\nDark clothes (6 items): randomly assign 3 to W, 3 to C.\n\\[\n\\text{Dark-W: } 7,6,7 \\quad (\\bar y_{DW}=6.67),\\qquad\n\\text{Dark-C: } 6,5,6 \\quad (\\bar y_{DC}=5.67).\n\\]\nWithin-block effects:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\Delta}_{L}=\\bar y_{LW}-\\bar y_{LC}=1.00,\\qquad\n\\widehat{\\Delta}_{D}=\\bar y_{DW}-\\bar y_{DC}=1.00.\n\\]\nOverall warm vs cold means:\n\\[\n\\bar y_W=\\frac{9+8+9+7+6+7}{6}=7.67,\\qquad\n\\bar y_C=\\frac{8+7+8+6+5+6}{6}=6.67,\n\\]\nso overall effect $\\widehat{\\Delta}=\\bar y_W-\\bar y_C=1.00$.\nBlocking also lets you report effects separately for light and dark clothing.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{Matched pairs designs}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Matched pairs design]\nA \\emph{matched pairs} design is a common randomized block design for comparing two treatments:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Either match similar units into pairs and randomly assign treatments within each pair, or\n\\item Each unit receives both treatments in random order (the unit is its own control).\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Analysis for matched pairs]\nThe natural analysis uses within-pair differences.\nIf subject $i$ receives both treatments and responses are $y_{i1},y_{i2}$, define\n\\[\nd_i = y_{i1}-y_{i2},\\qquad \\bar d = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n d_i.\n\\]\nThen $\\bar d$ estimates the treatment effect for the paired design.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{example}[Standing vs sitting pulse (toy paired data)]\nSix students measure pulse rate (beats/min) while sitting and standing:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\text{Student }i & 1&2&3&4&5&6\\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Sitting }(S_i) & 66&70&64&72&68&69\\\\\n\\text{Standing }(T_i) & 73&76&70&79&74&74\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nCompute differences $d_i=T_i-S_i$:\n\\[\nd=(7,6,6,7,6,5),\\qquad\n\\bar d = \\frac{7+6+6+7+6+5}{6}=\\frac{37}{6}\\approx 6.17.\n\\]\nHere every $d_i>0$, and the average increase is about 6.17 bpm.\nBecause each subject is compared to themself, much person-to-person variability is removed.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Design determines analysis]\nFor a completely randomized design comparing two groups, compare group distributions (e.g.\\ dotplots) and group means.\nFor matched pairs, analyze the differences $d_i$; treating the two measurements as independent throws away the main advantage of pairing.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\section*{Exercises (curated and paraphrased from Section 4.2)}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Exercises (curated and paraphrased from Section 4.2)}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\textbf{4.2.\\arabic*}, leftmargin=*]\n\n\\item \\textbf{Chocolate during pregnancy.}\nResearchers asked pregnant women to report how often they ate chocolate, then later asked them to rate their infants' temperament at 6 months.\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\alph*)]\n\\item Observational study or experiment?

Response: infant temperament ratings at 6 months.\\\\\n(c) No causation: likely confounding (e.g.\\ maternal stress, socioeconomic status, diet quality, health behaviors) associated with chocolate intake and infant outcomes.\n\n\\item\n(a) Observational: time in child care is not randomly assigned.\\\\\n(b) Explanatory: time in child care (birth to 4.5 years). Response: later behavior ratings (aggression, etc.).\\\\\n(c) No causation: families selecting child care differ (parent work schedules, income, parenting style), which may affect behavior.\n\n\\item\n(a) Experiment: students are randomly assigned to software vs textbook.\\\\\n(b) If the software group has a substantially higher mean score increase (and the difference is statistically significant under the random assignment), conclude the software \\emph{caused} higher improvement for these students in this setting (cause-and-effect in the study context).\n\n\\item\nExample lurking variable: school resources/teacher quality (or student prior achievement). If higher-resourced schools both create smaller classes \\emph{and} improve outcomes, class size and outcomes are confounded.\n\n\\item\nExperimental units: individual seedlings. Factor: light level. Levels/treatments: full, 25\\% of normal, 5\\% of normal (3 treatments). Response: dry weight (mass) at end.\n\n\\item\nUnits: schools. Two factors: activity intervention (yes/no) and nutrition intervention (yes/no). Treatments: none, activity only, nutrition only, both (a $2\\times 2$ factorial). Responses: measured activity; fat consumption at lunch (and any other listed outcomes).\n\n\\item\nMain flaw: no randomized control/comparison group. Pre--post improvement could be due to time, measurement effects, regression to the mean, placebo/expectation, etc.\n\n\\item\n(a) Violates random assignment (uses self-selection). Confounding: more motivated/stronger players may choose one program and also do better regardless of treatment.\\\\\n(b) Push-ups may be relevant, but it captures only one dimension of ``upper-body strength'' and is sensitive to effort/practice; consider multiple strength measures.\n\n\\item\nNot blind: the rater (experimenter) knows who got meditation and may (consciously or not) score them as less anxious. This expectancy effect can bias results in favor of meditation.\n\n\\item\nRandomized: assignment to supplement vs placebo uses chance. Placebo-controlled: control group receives an inactive pill that looks like treatment, so pill-taking/expectation is balanced. Double-blind: neither subjects nor evaluators know who received which until after the study ends.\n\n\\item\n(a) If Litter 1 is healthier and all get Diet A, then any extra weight gain could be due to litter/genetics/health, not diet; diet and litter are associated $\\Rightarrow$ confounding.\\\\\n(b) Block by litter: within each litter randomly assign 5 rats to Diet A and 5 to Diet B (or otherwise split evenly by random assignment within litter).\n\n\\item\n(a) If Hilton and Tolley use multimedia and Christensen and Hadfield use standard, then any score differences could be due to instructor differences rather than technology (instructor is confounded with technology).\\\\\n(b) Block by instructor: each instructor teaches one section with standard and one with multimedia, with the assignment of technology to that instructor's two sections done at random (or randomize within instructor).\n\n\\item\n(a) Matched pairs / crossover design (each subject receives both treatments on different days).\\\\\n(b) Controls for person-to-person variability: each subject is their own control, typically reducing variability and increasing sensitivity.\\\\\n(c) To prevent order/carryover effects from systematically favoring one treatment (e.g.\\ if first day always has novelty or residual effects).\n\n\\item\n(a) CRD: randomly assign 10 subjects to 70$^\\circ$F and 10 to 90$^\\circ$F; keep other conditions identical; compare mean correct insertions.\\\\\n(b) Matched pairs: each subject performs the task twice, once at each temperature; randomize the order (70 then 90 vs 90 then 70) and allow appropriate rest/washout; analyze within-subject differences.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"afeb795c-9648-4aa3-8a5c-0bdb21b5da7e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"77cad4a3-3e01-4465-8cb6-b39124d83d26","turn_exchange_id":"3c3f5c76-1a1a-448b-a235-4082a0cbd265"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"77cad4a3-3e01-4465-8cb6-b39124d83d26","children":["8af78b54-bfa8-464f-b699-d21818338ddd"]},"8af78b54-bfa8-464f-b699-d21818338ddd":{"id":"8af78b54-bfa8-464f-b699-d21818338ddd","message":{"id":"8af78b54-bfa8-464f-b699-d21818338ddd","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768715387.064,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Same

Here are two examples.\r\n[L23] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L24] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L25] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L26] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L27] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L28] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L29] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L30] on the design of the study.\r\n[L31] Scope of Inference\r\n[L32] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L33] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L34] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L35] results of the sample.\r\n[L36] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L37] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L38] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L39] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L40] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L41] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L42] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L43] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L44] 4.3\r\n[L45] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L46] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L47] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L48] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L49] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L50] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L51] Yes No\r\n[L52] Were individuals \r\n[L53] randomly selected?\n# \u30101\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file1\ue201\nMclick Target: \"11:1\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L2] boards.\r\n[L3] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L4] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L5] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L6] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L7] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L8] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L9] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L10] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L11] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L12] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L13] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L14] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L15] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L16] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L17] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity. Anonym\ufffeity means that individuals are anonymous\u2014their names <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 63 / 75>Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 267\r\n[L18] are not known even to the director of the study. Anonymity is rare in statistical stud\ufffeies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it \r\n[L19] prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform individuals of results.\r\n[L20] Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L21] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L22] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L23] other identification have been removed from the data available for search. Privacy \r\n[L24] and confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the computer age.\r\n[L25] ACTIVITY Response bias\r\n[L26] In this Activity, your team will design and conduct an experiment to investigate \r\n[L27] the effects of response bias in surveys.53 You may choose the topic for your sur\ufffeveys, but you must design your experiment so that it can answer at least one of the \r\n[L28] following questions:\r\n[L29] sCan the wording of a question create response bias?\r\n[L30] sDo the characteristics of the interviewer create response bias?\r\n[L31] sDoes anonymity change the responses to sensitive questions?\r\n[L32] sDoes manipulating the answer choices change the response?\r\n[L33] 1.

Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L19] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L20] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L21] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L22] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L23] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L24] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L25] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L26] part in a study.

Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L29] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L30] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L31] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L32] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L33] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L34] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L35] SOLUTION:\r\n[L36] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L37] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L38] EXAMPLE\r\n[L39] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L40] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L41] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L42] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L43] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L44] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L45] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\n# \u30104\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"11:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L2] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L4] on the design of the study.\r\n[L5] Scope of Inference\r\n[L6] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L7] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L8] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L9] results of the sample.\r\n[L10] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L11] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L12] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L13] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L14] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L15] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L16] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L17] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L18] 4.3\r\n[L19] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L20] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L21] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population.

Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L4] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L5] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L6] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L7] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L8] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L9] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L10] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L11] SOLUTION:\r\n[L12] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L13] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L14] EXAMPLE\r\n[L15] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L16] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L17] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L18] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L19] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L20] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L21] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L22] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L23] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L24] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L25] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L26] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L27] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L28] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L29] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L30] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L31] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L32] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L33] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L34] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L35] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L36] the town.\r\n[L37] The Challenges of \r\n[L38] Establishing Causation\r\n[L39] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L40] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L41] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L42] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L43] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L44] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L45] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\n# \u30102\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn12file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"12:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L2] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L4] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L5] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L6] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical.

De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L12] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L13] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L14] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L15] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L16] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L17] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L18] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L19] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L20] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L21] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L22] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug.

A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L26] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L27] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L28] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L29] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L30] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L23] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L24] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L25] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L26] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L27] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L28] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L29] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L30] on the design of the study.\r\n[L31] Scope of Inference\r\n[L32] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L33] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L34] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L35] results of the sample.\r\n[L36] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L37] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L38] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L39] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L40] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L41] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L42] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L43] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L44] 4.3\r\n[L45] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L46] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L47] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L39] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L40] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L41] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L42] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L43] results.\r\n[L44] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L45] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L46] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L47] lurking variables.\r\n[L48] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L49] review board. All participants must give their informed consent before \r\n[L50] taking part. Any information about the individuals in the study must be \r\n[L51] kept confidential.\r\n[L52] s Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions \r\n[L53] that can\u2019t be answered without them.

Consider \r\n[L9] these important questions:\r\n[L10] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L11] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L12] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L13] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L14] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L15] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L16] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L17] studies.\r\n[L18] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L19] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L20] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L21] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L22] Living with observational studies\r\n[L23] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L24] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L25] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L26] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L27] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L28] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L29] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L30] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L31] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L32] experiment?\r\n[L33] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L34] very strong.\r\n[L35] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L36] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L37] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L38] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L39] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L40] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L41] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L42] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L43] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L44] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L45] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L46] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L47] cancer death among women.<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L48] sThe alleged cause is plausible.

Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L4] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L5] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L6] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L7] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L8] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L9] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L10] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L11] SOLUTION:\r\n[L12] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L13] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L14] EXAMPLE\r\n[L15] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L16] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L17] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L18] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L19] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L20] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L21] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L22] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L23] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L24] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L25] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L26] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L27] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L28] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L29] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L30] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L31] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L32] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L33] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L34] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L35] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L36] the town.\r\n[L37] The Challenges of \r\n[L38] Establishing Causation\r\n[L39] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L40] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L41] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L42] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L43] experiment may not be realistic.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L28] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L29] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L30] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L31] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L32] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L33] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L34] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L35] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L36] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L37] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L38] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L39] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L40] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L41] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L42] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L43] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L44] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L45] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L46] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L47] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L48] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L49] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L50] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L51] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L52] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L53] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L54] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L55] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L56] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a9a2c4c5c24a51b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_57.jpg","size_bytes":59616,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://7aacadbacce6f03#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_26.jpg","size_bytes":68207,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null}],"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":13,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["recording_knowledge","files_uploaded_in_conversation"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"fa2464e2-8f88-4ca9-bfa4-7912417bce11","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"835c40d3-78d3-4149-bf97-023c89b6fe19","turn_exchange_id":"4ad2651e-abe0-4236-92e8-febd8f85f425"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"835c40d3-78d3-4149-bf97-023c89b6fe19","children":["81c0caf9-e971-462e-bce3-757c81548b14"]},"81c0caf9-e971-462e-bce3-757c81548b14":{"id":"81c0caf9-e971-462e-bce3-757c81548b14","message":{"id":"81c0caf9-e971-462e-bce3-757c81548b14","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768715493.787875,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Organizing the criteria and examples for causation","content":"I found the smoking criteria list, but I\u2019ll need the rest of it, like \"association is plausible\" and similar points to complete the summary.

It has three pillars: **scope of inference**, **challenges of establishing causation**, and **data ethics**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn12file3\ue202L14-L20\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 1) Scope of inference\n\n### Core idea: two different \u201csuperpowers\u201d\n- **Inference about a population** requires **random sampling** from that population. \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file0\ue202L31-L35\ue201  \n- **Inference about cause-and-effect** requires **random assignment** of treatments. \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file0\ue202L36-L42\ue201  \n\nA key nuance the text stresses: many experiments randomize assignment but use **volunteers**, so they support causation **for the study subjects** but don\u2019t automatically generalize to a larger population. \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file0\ue202L43-L43\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file4\ue202L33-L36\ue201\n\n### The \u201cscope-of-inference matrix\u201d (the main \u201cformula\u201d of Section 4.3)\nLet:\n- RS = individuals **randomly selected** from the population  \n- RA = individuals **randomly assigned** to groups/treatments  \n\nThen the conclusions you can draw are summarized by the 2\u00d72 logic: \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file3\ue202L1-L5\ue201\n\n- **RS + RA** \u21d2 inference about **population** YES; inference about **cause/effect** YES  \n- **RS + no RA** \u21d2 population YES; cause/effect NO  \n- **no RS + RA** \u21d2 population NO; cause/effect YES  \n- **no RS + no RA** \u21d2 population NO; cause/effect NO  \n\nThis is also restated explicitly: random selection \u2192 population inference; random assignment \u2192 causal inference. \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file4\ue202L20-L23\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Examples for the four cases\n\n### Case A: RS + RA (generalize + causal)\n**Example (constructed numeric version of \u201cvitamin C and canker sores\u201d design 4):**  \n- Randomly sample 200 dental patients in a town, then randomly assign 100 to vitamin C and 100 to no vitamin C (or placebo).  \n- Suppose canker sores occur in 18/100 (vitamin C) vs 32/100 (control).  \n  - \\(\\hat p_C = 0.18,\\ \\hat p_0 = 0.32,\\ \\widehat{\\Delta}_p = -0.14\\).  \nIf the difference is statistically significant, the dentist can conclude **vitamin C reduces canker sores for the population of dental patients in that town**, because both RS and RA are present (with the usual \u201cassuming proper control\u201d caveat). \ue200filecite\ue202turn12file1\ue202L30-L36\ue201\n\n### Case B: RS + no RA (generalize association only)\n**Example (constructed numeric version of design 3):**  \n- Randomly sample 200 dental patients; do **not** assign treatment\u2014just observe who already takes vitamin C.  \n- Suppose sores occur in 10/80 vitamin-C users vs 50/120 nonusers.  \n  - \\(\\hat p_{\\text{users}}=0.125,\\ \\hat p_{\\text{non}} \\approx 0.417\\).  \nYou may generalize the **association** to the town\u2019s dental-patient population, but you **cannot** claim vitamin C caused the difference (confounding is possible). \ue200filecite\ue202turn12file1\ue202L22-L27\ue201\n\n### Case C: no RS + RA (causal for subjects only)\n**Example (sleep deprivation experiment):**  \nSubjects are randomly assigned to sleep deprivation vs unrestricted sleep; if performance differs by more than chance variation from random assignment, you can conclude the treatment caused the difference **in the study**\u2014but because they are volunteers, generalizing to a larger population is limited. \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file0\ue202L36-L43\ue201\n\n### Case D: no RS + no RA (descriptive only)\nIf you use a convenience group (e.g., \u201cpatients with appointments next two weeks\u201d) and also don\u2019t randomize treatments, you can\u2019t generalize to a population and can\u2019t claim causation; you only have a description of what happened in those participants. \ue200filecite\ue202turn12file1\ue202L12-L17\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 2) Challenges of establishing causation\n\n### A) Even good experiments may not \u201ctransfer\u201d (lack of realism)\nA well-designed experiment can establish that \\(X\\) caused \\(Y\\) **for the particular subjects, treatments, and environment of the experiment**, but the big threat is **lack of realism**\u2014the study setting may not match the setting you care about. \ue200filecite\ue202turn12file1\ue202L39-L44\ue201  \n\n**Example: high center brake lights (external validity problem).**  \n- Early randomized comparative experiments (before the feature was widespread) suggested up to **50%** fewer rear-end collisions.  \n- After the third brake light became standard, the real-world drop was only about **5%**.  \nThe explanation given: the \u201cextra\u201d light was attention-grabbing when rare; once common, it no longer stood out. \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file3\ue202L24-L30\ue201  \n\n**Numeric sanity check:** if a fleet had 100 rear-end crashes/year, a 50% reduction predicts 50 crashes/year; a 5% reduction predicts 95 crashes/year\u2014huge gap driven by context change, not arithmetic.\n\n### B) Sometimes you *can\u2019t* do experiments (practical/ethical limits)\nFor many causal questions, random assignment is infeasible or unethical (e.g., forcing texting-while-driving, forcing smoking, etc.), so observational studies become the best available evidence. \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file3\ue202L33-L42\ue201\n\n### C) When experiments are impossible: criteria to argue causation from observational evidence\nSection 4.3 gives a concrete checklist (developed via the smoking\u2013lung cancer case study) for building a strong causal argument without an experiment:\n\n1) **Strong association** (relationship is large). \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file0\ue202L33-L35\ue201  \n2) **Consistent association** across many studies, groups, and settings (reduces chance a single lurking variable explains it). \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file0\ue202L35-L37\ue201  \n3) **Dose\u2013response pattern**: larger exposure \u2194 stronger response; risk drops when exposure stops. \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file0\ue202L38-L40\ue201  \n4) **Temporal order**: the cause precedes the effect (with plausible lags). \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file0\ue202L41-L46\ue201  \n5) **Plausible mechanism** (e.g., supporting lab/animal evidence). \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file0\ue202L48-L48\ue201  \n\nThe narrative explicitly raises and confronts lurking-variable/confounding objections (e.g., genetics, correlated unhealthy habits). \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file0\ue202L24-L30\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 3) Data ethics (human subjects)\n\n### The three non-negotiables (\u201cbasic data ethics\u201d)\nAny study involving human subjects\u2014observational or experimental\u2014must satisfy:  \n1) **Institutional review board** (IRB) review in advance  \n2) **Informed consent** before collecting data  \n3) **Confidentiality** of individual data (only group summaries public) \ue200filecite\ue202turn12file0\ue202L9-L15\ue201  \n\n### What these mean in practice\n- **IRB (institutional review board):** its role is protecting participants\u2019 rights/welfare; it reviews the study plan, can require changes, reviews the consent form, and monitors ongoing research. \ue200filecite\ue202turn12file0\ue202L19-L26\ue201  \n- **Informed consent:** subjects must be told the nature/purpose of the study and risks (physical or even emotional for sensitive surveys) and then consent (typically in writing). \ue200filecite\ue202turn12file0\ue202L29-L36\ue201  \n- **Confidentiality vs anonymity:** confidentiality means identities are known to researchers but protected;

Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L25] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L26] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L27] sleep.

The answer depends \r\n[L30] on the design of the study.\r\n[L31] Scope of Inference\r\n[L32] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L33] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L34] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L35] results of the sample.\r\n[L36] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L37] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L38] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L39] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L40] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L41] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L42] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L43] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L44] 4.3\r\n[L45] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L46] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L47] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L39] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L40] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L41] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L42] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L43] results.\r\n[L44] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L45] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L46] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L47] lurking variables.\r\n[L48] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L49] review board. All participants must give their informed consent before \r\n[L50] taking part. Any information about the individuals in the study must be \r\n[L51] kept confidential.\r\n[L52] s Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions \r\n[L53] that can\u2019t be answered without them. Also remember that \u201cthe interests of \r\n[L54] the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\u201d54\r\n[L55] Summary SECTION 4.3\r\n[L56] Magnets and Pain\r\n[L57] Let\u2019s return to the chapter-opening Case Study (page 205). Researchers carried \r\n[L58] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L59] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment.\n# \u30103\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn14file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"14:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board.

Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L5] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L6] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L7] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L8] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L9] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L10] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L11] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L12] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L13] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L14] collected data about them.

Anonymity is rare in statistical stud\ufffeies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it \r\n[L19] prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform individuals of results.\r\n[L20] Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L21] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L22] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L23] other identification have been removed from the data available for search. Privacy \r\n[L24] and confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the computer age.\r\n[L25] ACTIVITY Response bias\r\n[L26] In this Activity, your team will design and conduct an experiment to investigate \r\n[L27] the effects of response bias in surveys.53 You may choose the topic for your sur\ufffeveys, but you must design your experiment so that it can answer at least one of the \r\n[L28] following questions:\r\n[L29] sCan the wording of a question create response bias?\r\n[L30] sDo the characteristics of the interviewer create response bias?\r\n[L31] sDoes anonymity change the responses to sensitive questions?\r\n[L32] sDoes manipulating the answer choices change the response?\r\n[L33] 1.

Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L25] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L26] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L27] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L28] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L29] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L30] on the design of the study.\r\n[L31] Scope of Inference\r\n[L32] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L33] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L34] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L35] results of the sample.\r\n[L36] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L37] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L38] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L39] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L40] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L41] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L42] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L43] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L44] 4.3\r\n[L45] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L46] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L47] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population.

The \r\n[L49] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L50] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L51] Yes No\r\n[L52] Were individuals \r\n[L53] randomly selected?\n# \u30102\u2020designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\u2020file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn15file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"15:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] (d) No, because this is an observational study.

It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L2] boards.\r\n[L3] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L4] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L5] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L6] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L7] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L8] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L9] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L10] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L11] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L12] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L13] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L14] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential.

Anonymity is rare in statistical stud\ufffeies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it \r\n[L19] prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform individuals of results.\r\n[L20] Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L21] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L22] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L23] other identification have been removed from the data available for search.

De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L12] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L13] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L14] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L15] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L16] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L17] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L18] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L19] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L20] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L21] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L22] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug.

A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L26] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L27] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L28] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L29] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L30] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects.

By the end of the chapter, you\u2019ll be ready to interpret \r\n[L7] the results of this study.\r\n[L8] Early research showed that magnetic fields affected living tissue in humans. Some doc\ufffetors have begun to use magnets to treat patients with chronic pain. Scientists wondered \r\n[L9] whether this type of therapy really worked. They designed a study to find out.\r\n[L10] Fifty patients with chronic pain were recruited for the study. A doctor identified a painful \r\n[L11] site on each patient and asked him or her to rate the pain on a scale from 0 (mild pain) to \r\n[L12] 10 (severe pain). Then, the doctor selected a sealed envelope containing a magnet from a \r\n[L13] box that contained both active and inactive magnets. That way, neither the doctor nor the \r\n[L14] patient knew which type of magnet was being used. The chosen magnet was applied to \r\n[L15] the site of the pain for 45 minutes. After \u201ctreatment,\u201d each patient was again asked to rate \r\n[L16] the level of pain from 0 to 10.\r\n[L17] In all, 29 patients were given active magnets and 21 patients received inactive magnets. \r\n[L18] All but one of the patients rated their initial pain as an 8, 9, or 10.

Here are \r\n[L26] some examples:\r\n[L27] sThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\n[L28] seat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\n[L29] sAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\n[L30] an average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\n[L31] teens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\n[L32] unsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\n[L33] sA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\n[L34] of catching a cold.4\r\n[L35] sFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\n[L36] that listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\n[L37] Can we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\n[L38] depends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\n[L39] look at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\n[L40] Each year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\n[L41] vehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\n[L42] people in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\n[L43] of an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\n[L44] asking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\n[L45] conducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\n[L46] about some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\n[L47] In the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\n[L48] questions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\n[L49] them a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\n[L50] observational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\n[L51] drawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\n[L52] while listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\n[L53] list of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\n[L54] The goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\n[L55] changes in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\n[L56] the ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\n[L57] Here\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\n[L58] ACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\n[L59] MATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\n[L60] clock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\n[L61] Confucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget.

To answer the question, we will interview 16- to 20-year-olds \r\n[L70] who live in the United States and drive. Ideally, we would ask them all (take a \r\n[L71] census). But contacting every driver in this age group wouldn\u2019t be practical: it \r\n[L72] would take too much time and cost too much money. Instead, we put the question \r\n[L73] to a sample chosen to represent the entire population of young drivers.\r\n[L74] 4.1\r\n[L75] In Section 4.1, \r\n[L76] you\u2019ll learn about: \r\n[L77] sThe idea of a sample \r\n[L78] survey\r\n[L79] sHow to sample badly\r\n[L80] sHow to sample well: \r\n[L81] Random sampling\r\n[L82] sOther sampling methods\r\n[L83] sInference for sampling\r\n[L84] sSample surveys: What \r\n[L85] can go wrong?\r\n[L86] 1. Divide the class into pairs of students by drawing names from a hat.\r\n[L87] 2. Your teacher will give each pair two index cards with 10 sets of numbers \r\n[L88] on them. Do not look at the numbers until it is time for you to do the \r\n[L89] experiment.\r\n[L90] 3. Flip a coin to decide which of you is Student A and which is Student B. \r\n[L91] Shuffle the index cards and deal one face down to each partner.\r\n[L92] 4. Student A will attempt a memory task while Student B keeps time.\r\n[L93] Directions: Study the pairs of numbers on the index card for 30 seconds. Then \r\n[L94] turn the card over. Recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.). Then tell your part\ufffener (Student B) what you think the numbers on the card are. Student B will \r\n[L95] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L96] 5. Now it\u2019s Student B\u2019s turn to do a memory task while Student A records the data.\r\n[L97] Directions: Your partner will read the pairs of numbers on your index card aloud \r\n[L98] three times slowly. Next, you will recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.) and \r\n[L99] then tell your partner what you think the numbers on the card are. Student A will \r\n[L100] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L101] 6. Your teacher will scale and label axes on the board for parallel dotplots of the re\ufffesults. Plot the number of pairs you remembered correctly on the appropriate graph.\r\n[L102] 7. Did students in your class remember numbers better when they saw them or \r\n[L103] when they heard them? Give appropriate evidence to support your answer.\r\n[L104] 8. Based on the results of this experiment, can we conclude that people in gen\ufffeeral remember better when they see than when they hear? Why or why not?\r\n[L105] DEFINITION: Population and sample\r\n[L106] The population in a statistical study is the entire group of individuals about which we \r\n[L107] want information.\r\n[L108] A sample is the part of the population from which we actually collect information. We \r\n[L109] use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\n[L110] The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\n[L111] sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\n[L112] Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\n[L113] uses of sampling.","[L114] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L115] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","[L116] 208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L117] EXAMPLE\r\n[L118] EXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\n[L119] Populations and samples\r\n[L120] PROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n[L121] (a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\n[L122] before shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\n[L123] five pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\n[L124] moisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n[L125] (b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\n[L126] SOLUTION:\r\n[L127] (a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\n[L128] that are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n[L129] (b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\n[L130] For Practice Try Exercise 1\r\n[L131] The Idea of a Sample Survey\r\n[L132] We often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\n[L133] basis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\n[L134] and ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\n[L135] cream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\n[L136] whole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\n[L137] varied population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\n[L138] The first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\n[L139] what population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\n[L140] exactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\n[L141] We reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\n[L142] example. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\n[L143] or \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\n[L144] or more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example. We\u2019ll avoid this more \r\n[L145] restrictive terminology.\r\n[L146] Sample survey\r\n[L147] How Does the Current Population Survey Work?\r\n[L148] A sample survey\r\n[L149] One of the most important government sample surveys in the United States is \r\n[L150] the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS contacts about 60,000 \r\n[L151] households each month. It produces the monthly unemployment rate and much ","[L152] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://78b0ae7eaeb088a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":58525,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L153] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>","[L154] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 209\r\n[L155] The final step in planning a sample survey is to decide how to choose a sample \r\n[L156] from the population. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some good and not-so-good sam\ufffepling methods.\r\n[L157] How to Sample Badly\r\n[L158] How can we choose a sample that we can trust to represent the population? \r\n[L159] The easiest\u2014but not the best\u2014sampling method just chooses individuals who \r\n[L160] are close by. Suppose we\u2019re interested in finding out how long students at a \r\n[L161] large high school spent on homework last week, for example. We might go to \r\n[L162] the school library and ask the first 30 students we see about their homework \r\n[L163] time. A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\n[L164] easiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\n[L165] produce unrepresentative data.\r\n[L166] other economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\n[L167] specify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\n[L168] all U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\n[L169] not in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\n[L170] news refers to this specific population.\r\n[L171] What does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\n[L172] for example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\n[L173] she is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\n[L174] first asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\n[L175] work in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\n[L176] you are not in the labor force.\r\n[L177] If you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\n[L178] you did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\n[L179] you are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\n[L180] pay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\n[L181] because of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason. An unemployment rate \r\n[L182] of 9.7% means that 9.7% of the sample was unemployed, using the exact CPS \r\n[L183] definitions of both \u201clabor force\u201d and \u201cunemployed.\u201d\r\n[L184] DEFINITION: Convenience sample\r\n[L185] Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach results in a convenience sample.\r\n[L186] What\u2019s wrong with our convenience sample of students in the library? It\u2019s \r\n[L187] unlikely that this sample represents the homework habits of all students at the \r\n[L188] school well. In fact, we\u2019d expect the sample to overestimate the average homework \r\n[L189] time in the population since students who hang out in the library might tend to \r\n[L190] be more studious. This is bias: using a method that will consistently overestimate \r\n[L191] or underestimate the value you want to know.","[L192] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bea60ae105051c9#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_4.jpg","size_bytes":53957,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L193] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>","[L194] 210 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L195] EXAMPLE\r\n[L196] DEFINITION: Bias\r\n[L197] The design of a statistical study shows bias if it systematically favors certain outcomes.\r\n[L198] Convenience samples are almost guaranteed to show bias. So are voluntary \r\n[L199] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L200] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L201] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L202] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L203] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L204] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L205] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L206] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L207] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L208] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L209] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L210] to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\n[L211] Illegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\n[L212] Online polls\r\n[L213] Former CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\n[L214] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L215] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L216] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L217] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L218] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L219] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L220] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L221] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L222] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L223] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L224] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L225] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L226] the direction of the bias. Suppose you were asked, \u201cExplain how using a convenience sample of students in \r\n[L227] your statistics class to estimate the proportion of all high school students who own a graphing calculator could \r\n[L228] result in bias.\u201d You might respond, \u201cThis sample would probably include a much higher proportion of students \r\n[L229] with a graphing calculator than in the population at large because a graphing calculator is required for the \r\n[L230] statistics class. That is, this method would probably lead to an overestimate of the actual population proportion.\u201d\r\n[L231] www\r\n[L232] For Practice Try Exercise 5","[L233] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6ad2f94da5ad6a1#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_5.jpg","size_bytes":57756,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L234] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>","[L235] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 211\r\n[L236] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L237] For each of the following situations, identify the sampling method used.

More than 186,000 callers responded, and 67% said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n[L244] How to Sample Well: \r\n[L245] Random Sampling\r\n[L246] In a voluntary response sample, people choose whether to respond. In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L247] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L248] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L249] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L250] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L251] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L252] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L253] random sample.\r\n[L254] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L255] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L256] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L257] sample actually selected.\r\n[L258] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L259] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L260] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L261] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L262] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L263] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L264] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L265] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L266] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L267] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L268] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L269] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L270] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L271] if the population is large.

If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L280] random digits.\r\n[L281] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L282] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L283] these properties:\r\n[L284] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L285] s The entries are independent of each other.

There are two steps in using \r\n[L291] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L292] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L293] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L294] same length.\r\n[L295] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L296] from Table D.\r\n[L297] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L298] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L299] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L300] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L301] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L302] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L303] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L304] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L305] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L306] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L307] and so on\u2014because the table has no order. We recommend reading across rows \r\n[L308] from left to right.","[L309] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://fed072027c0760d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_7.jpg","size_bytes":43027,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L310] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 75>","[L311] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 213\r\n[L312] Spring Break!\r\n[L313] Choosing an SRS with Table D\r\n[L314] The school newspaper is planning an article on family-friendly \r\n[L315] places to stay over spring break at a nearby beach town.

What \r\n[L394] advantage(s) does random sampling provide?\r\n[L395] There\u2019s an important difference between the samples produced by the Simple\r\n[L396] Random Sample applet and the calculator\u2019s randInt command in the Technol\ufffeogy Corner. The applet sampled without replacement from the \u201cPopulation hop\ufffeper,\u201d but the calculator sampled with replacement from the specified population. \r\n[L397] As a result, the calculator sometimes selects the same number more than once in \r\n[L398] a given sample. To deal with this problem, you can generate additional random \r\n[L399] numbers as needed to replace any repeats. Or you can use a method other than \r\n[L400] randInt (like randSamp on the TI-Nspire) to sample without replacement. Refer \r\n[L401] to your device\u2019s reference manual or ask your teacher.\r\n[L402] We can trust results from an SRS, as well as from other types of random samples \r\n[L403] that we will meet later, because the use of impersonal chance avoids bias. Online\r\n[L404] and call-in polls also produce samples. But we can\u2019t trust results from these sam\ufffeples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. The first question to ask about \r\n[L405] any sample is whether it was chosen at random.\r\n[L406] Other Sampling Methods\r\n[L407] The basic idea of sampling is straightforward: take an SRS from the population \r\n[L408] and use your sample results to gain information about the population. Unfor\ufffetunately, it\u2019s usually very difficult to actually get an SRS from the population of \r\n[L409] interest. Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L410] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L411] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L412] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L413] selected.

Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L420] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L421] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L422] between strata.\r\n[L423] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L424] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L425] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L426] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L427] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L428] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L429] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L430] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L431] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size. Not convinced? Try \r\n[L432] the following Activity.\r\n[L433] ACTIVITY Sampling sunflowers\r\n[L434] A British farmer grows sunflowers for making sunflower oil. Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L435] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L436] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L437] money she\u2019ll make from selling them. It would take too much time to \r\n[L438] count the plants in all 100 squares, so she\u2019ll accept an estimate based on \r\n[L439] a sample of 10 squares.\r\n[L440] 1. Use Table D or technology to take a simple random sample of 10 \r\n[L441] grid squares. Record the location (for example, B6) of each square you \r\n[L442] select.\r\n[L443] 2. This time, you\u2019ll take a stratified random sample using the \r\n[L444] rows as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select \r\n[L445] one square from each (horizontal) row. Record the location of \r\n[L446] each square.\r\n[L447] 3. Now, take a stratified random sample using the columns\r\n[L448] as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select one \r\n[L449] square from each (vertical) column. Record the location of \r\n[L450] each square.\r\n[L451] 4. The table on page N/DS-6 gives the actual number of \r\n[L452] sunflowers in each grid square.

How did the three sampling methods do?\r\n[L472] The following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\n[L473] in the music business.\r\n[L474] Who Wrote That Song?\r\n[L475] Using a stratified random sample\r\n[L476] A radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\n[L477] The organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\n[L478] members by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\n[L479] ASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\n[L480] year. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L481] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L482] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L483] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L484] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L485] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L486] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L487] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L488] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L489] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L490] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L491] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L492] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L493] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups. Ideally, these \r\n[L494] clusters should mirror the characteristics of the population. Then choose an SRS of the \r\n[L495] clusters. All individuals in the chosen clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L496] Imagine a large high school that assigns its students to homerooms alphabeti\ufffecally by last name. The school administration is considering a new schedule and \r\n[L497] would like student input. Administrators decide to survey 200 randomly selected \r\n[L498] students.

They don\u2019t offer the statistical advantage of better information about the \r\n[L507] population that stratified random samples do. That\u2019s because clusters are often \r\n[L508] chosen for ease or convenience, so they may have as much variability as the popu\ufffelation itself. Be sure you understand the difference between strata and clusters. \r\n[L509] We want each stratum to contain similar individuals, and for there to be large \r\n[L510] differences between strata.

Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L619] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L620] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L621] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L622] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L623] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L624] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L625] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L626] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L627] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L628] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L629] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L630] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L631] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L632] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L633] Sampling Units, or PSUs. Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\n[L634] the 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\n[L635] of the others.\r\n[L636] Stage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\n[L637] Stratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\n[L638] Stage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\n[L639] units. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\n[L640] Analyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\n[L641] beyond basic statistics. But the SRS is the building block of more elaborate \r\n[L642] methods, and the principles of analysis remain much the same for these other \r\n[L643] methods.\r\n[L644] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L645] The manager of a sports arena wants to learn more about the financial status of the people \r\n[L646] who are attending an NBA basketball game.

Ticket prices for the game vary a \r\n[L647] great deal: seats near the court cost over $100 each, while seats in \r\n[L648] the top rows of the arena cost $25 each.

The \r\n[L666] process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\n[L667] called inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\n[L668] we know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\n[L669] response samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\n[L670] the population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\n[L671] selecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\n[L672] Still, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\n[L673] the entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\n[L674] the monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\n[L675] population. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\n[L676] almost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\n[L677] Inference\r\n[L678] ACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\n[L679] MATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\n[L680] other container that students can\u2019t see through\r\n[L681] In this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\n[L682] in relation to the population truth.\r\n[L683] 1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\n[L684] particular color.\r\n[L685] 2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\n[L686] record the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\n[L687] returned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n[L688] 3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\n[L689] is the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\n[L690] center? Is there a clear shape?\r\n[L691] Why can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\n[L692] results of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\n[L693] Because we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\n[L694] govern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\n[L695] results are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\n[L696] random sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\n[L697] the population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\n[L698] sets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\n[L699] for sampling later.\r\n[L700] One point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples. For instance, in the Activity, \r\n[L701] you would get a better estimate of the proportion of red chips in the popula\ufffeMargin of error","[L702] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 16 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://136106c58c36cbc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_15.jpg","size_bytes":54135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L703] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>","[L704] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 221\r\n[L705] tion using random samples of 40 chips than 20 chips. By taking a very large \r\n[L706] sample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\n[L707] about the population.\r\n[L708] The Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\n[L709] expect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\n[L710] of the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n[L711] 3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\n[L712] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L713] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L714] clicked a response.\r\n[L715] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L716] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L717] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L718] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L719] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L720] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L721] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L722] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L723] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L724] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L725] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L726] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L727] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L728] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L729] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L730] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L731] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L732] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L733] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L734] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L735] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L736] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L737] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L738] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L739] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L740] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L741] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L742] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L743] Sampling frame","[L744] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L745] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","[L746] 222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L747] EXAMPLE\r\n[L748] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L749] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L750] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L751] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L752] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L753] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L754] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L755] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L756] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L757] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L758] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L759] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L760] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L761] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L762] refuses to participate.\r\n[L763] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L764] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L765] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L766] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L767] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L768] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L769] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L770] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L771] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L772] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L773] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L774] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L775] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L776] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L777] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L778] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L779] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","[L780] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L781] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","[L782] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L783] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L784] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L785] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L786] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L787] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L788] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L789] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L790] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L791] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L792] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L793] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L794] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L795] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L796] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L797] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L798] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L799] memory. \u201cHave you visited a dentist in the last 6 months?\u201d will often draw a \r\n[L800] \u201cYes\u201d from someone who last visited a dentist 8 months ago.10 Careful training \r\n[L801] of interviewers and careful supervision to avoid variation among the interview\ufffeers can reduce response bias.

Different questions \r\n[L818] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L819] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L820] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L821] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L822] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L823] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L824] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L825] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L826] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L827] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L828] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L829] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L830] 1.

In contrast, beverage containers, third-class mail and yard wastes are estimated\r\n[L839] to account for about 21% of the trash in landfills. Given this, in your opinion, would it \r\n[L840] be fair to ban disposable diapers?11\r\n[L841] Explain how the wording of the question could result in bias. Be sure to specify the direc\ufffetion of the bias.\r\n[L842] Wording of questions\r\n[L843] ?\r\n[L844] THINK\r\n[L845] ABOUT\r\n[L846] IT\r\n[L847] EXAMPLE","[L848] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 20 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://248f22efb09cc94#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_19.jpg","size_bytes":52135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L849] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>","[L850] s A sample survey selects a sample from the population of all individuals \r\n[L851] about which we desire information. We base conclusions about the \r\n[L852] population on data from the sample. It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L853] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L854] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L855] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L856] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L857] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L858] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L859] process.\r\n[L860] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L861] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L862] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L863] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L864] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L865] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L866] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L867] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L868] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L869] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L870] prone to large bias.\r\n[L871] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L872] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L873] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L874] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L875] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L876] errors. These have nothing to do with choosing a sample\u2014they are \r\n[L877] present even in a census. The single biggest problem for sample surveys \r\n[L878] is nonresponse: people can\u2019t be contacted or refuse to answer. Incorrect \r\n[L879] answers by respondents can lead to response bias. Finally, the exact \r\n[L880] wording of questions has a big influence on the answers.\r\n[L881] Summary SECTION 4.1\r\n[L882] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 225\r\n[L883] 4.1 TECHNOLOGY CORNER\r\n[L884] Choosing an SRS..................................................................... page 214\r\n[L885] TI-Nspire instructions in Appendix B","[L886] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 21 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://af94379ba136b08#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_20.jpg","size_bytes":47602,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 75>","[L888] 226 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L889] 1. Students as customers A high school\u2019s student \r\n[L890] newspaper plans to survey local businesses about the \r\n[L891] importance of students as customers. From telephone \r\n[L892] book listings, the newspaper staff chooses 150 busi\ufffenesses at random. Of these, 73 return the question\ufffenaire mailed by the staff. Identify the population and \r\n[L893] the sample.\r\n[L894] 2. Student archaeologists An archaeological dig turns \r\n[L895] up large numbers of pottery shards, broken stone \r\n[L896] tools, and other artifacts. Students working on the \r\n[L897] project classify each artifact and assign it a number. \r\n[L898] The counts in different categories are important for \r\n[L899] understanding the site, so the project director chooses \r\n[L900] 2% of the artifacts at random and checks the students\u2019 \r\n[L901] work. Identify the population and the sample.\r\n[L902] 3. Sampling stuffed envelopes A large retailer prepares \r\n[L903] its customers\u2019 monthly credit card bills using an \r\n[L904] automatic machine that folds the bills, stuffs them \r\n[L905] into envelopes, and seals the envelopes for mailing. \r\n[L906] Are the envelopes completely sealed? Inspectors \r\n[L907] choose 40 envelopes from the 1000 stuffed each hour \r\n[L908] for visual inspection. Identify the population and the \r\n[L909] sample.\r\n[L910] 4. Customer satisfaction A department store mails \r\n[L911] a customer satisfaction survey to people who make \r\n[L912] credit card purchases at the store. This month, 45,000 \r\n[L913] people made credit card purchases. Surveys are \r\n[L914] mailed to 1000 of these people, chosen at random, \r\n[L915] and 137 people return the survey form. Identify the \r\n[L916] population and the sample.\r\n[L917] 5. Call the shots A newspaper advertisement for an \r\n[L918] upcoming TV show said: \u201cShould handgun control \r\n[L919] be tougher? You call the shots in a special call-in \r\n[L920] poll tonight. If yes, call 1-900-720-6181. If no, call \r\n[L921] 1-900-720-6182. Charge is 50 cents for the first \r\n[L922] minute.\u201d Explain why this opinion poll is almost \r\n[L923] certainly biased.\r\n[L924] 6. Explain it to the congresswoman You are on the \r\n[L925] staff of a member of Congress who is considering a \r\n[L926] bill that would provide government-sponsored insur\ufffeance for nursing-home care. You report that 1128 letters \r\n[L927] have been received on the issue, of which 871 oppose \r\n[L928] the legislation. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that most of my con\ufffestituents oppose the bill. I thought it would be quite \r\n[L929] popular,\u201d says the congresswoman. Are you convinced \r\n[L930] that a majority of the voters oppose the bill? How would \r\n[L931] you explain the statistical issue to the congresswoman?\r\n[L932] 7. Instant opinion A recent online poll posed the ques\ufffetion \u201cShould female athletes be paid the same as men \r\n[L933] for the work they do?\u2019\u2019 In all, 13,147 (44%) said \u201cYes,\u2019\u2019 \r\n[L934] 15,182 (50%) said \u201cNo,\u2019\u2019 and the remaining 1448 said \r\n[L935] \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d In spite of the large sample size for this \r\n[L936] survey, we can\u2019t trust the result. Why not?\r\n[L937] 8. Online polls In June 2008, Parade magazine posed \r\n[L938] the following question: \u201cShould drivers be banned \r\n[L939] from using all cell phones?\u201d Readers were encour\ufffeaged to vote online at parade.com. The July 13, 2008, \r\n[L940] issue of Parade reported the results: 2407 \r\n[L941] (85%) said \u201cYes\u201d and 410 (15%) said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n[L942] (a) What type of sample did the Parade survey \r\n[L943] obtain?\r\n[L944] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n[L945] 85% probably higher or lower than the true percent \r\n[L946] of all adults who believe that cell phone use while \r\n[L947] driving should be banned? Why?\r\n[L948] 9. Sleepless nights How much sleep do high school \r\n[L949] students get on a typical school night? An interested \r\n[L950] student designed a survey to find out. To make data \r\n[L951] collection easier, the student surveyed the first 100 \r\n[L952] students to arrive at school on a particular morning. \r\n[L953] These students reported an average of 7.2 hours of \r\n[L954] sleep on the previous night.\r\n[L955] (a) What type of sample did the student obtain?\r\n[L956] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n[L957] 7.2 hours probably higher or lower than the true aver\ufffeage amount of sleep last night for all students at the \r\n[L958] school? Why?\r\n[L959] 10. Sampling at the mall You have probably seen the \r\n[L960] mall interviewer, approaching people passing by with \r\n[L961] clipboard in hand. Explain why even a large sample \r\n[L962] of mall shoppers would not provide a trustworthy \r\n[L963] estimate of the current unemployment rate.\r\n[L964] 11. Do you trust the Internet? You want to ask a sample \r\n[L965] of high school students the question \u201cHow much do \r\n[L966] you trust information about health that you find on \r\n[L967] the Internet\u2014a great deal, somewhat, not much, or \r\n[L968] not at all?\u201d You try out this and other questions on a \r\n[L969] pilot group of 5 students chosen from your class. The \r\n[L970] class members are listed at top right.\r\n[L971] (a) Explain how you would use a line of Table D to \r\n[L972] choose an SRS of 5 students from the following list. \r\n[L973] Explain your method clearly enough for a classmate \r\n[L974] to obtain your results.\r\n[L975] pg 208\r\n[L976] pg 210\r\n[L977] pg 213\r\n[L978] SECTION 4.1 Exercises\r\n[L979] www","[L980] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 22 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6ed199a819f4209#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_21.jpg","size_bytes":69624,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L981] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 75>","[L982] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 227\r\n[L983] (b) Use line 107 to select the sample.

Sampling the forest To gather data on a 1200-acre \r\n[L1013] pine forest in Louisiana, the U.S. Forest Service laid a \r\n[L1014] grid of 1410 equally spaced circular plots over a map \r\n[L1015] of the forest. A ground survey visited a sample of 10% \r\n[L1016] of these plots.12\r\n[L1017] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table D \r\n[L1018] to choose an SRS of 141 plots.

Sampling gravestones The local genealogical society \r\n[L1023] in Coles County, Illinois, has compiled records on all \r\n[L1024] 55,914 gravestones in cemeteries in the county for the \r\n[L1025] years 1825 to 1985. Historians plan to use these records \r\n[L1026] to learn about African Americans in Coles County\u2019s his\ufffetory. They first choose an SRS of 395 records to check \r\n[L1027] their accuracy by visiting the actual gravestones.13\r\n[L1028] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table \r\n[L1029] D to choose the SRS.

Random digits Which of the following statements \r\n[L1037] are true of a table of random digits, and which are \r\n[L1038] false? Briefly explain your answers.\r\n[L1039] (a) There are exactly four 0s in each row of 40 digits.\r\n[L1040] (b) Each pair of digits has chance 1/100 of being 00.\r\n[L1041] (c) The digits 0000 can never appear as a group, \r\n[L1042] because this pattern is not random.\r\n[L1043] 17. iPhones Suppose 1000 iPhones are produced at a \r\n[L1044] factory today. Management would like to ensure \r\n[L1045] that the phones\u2019 display screens meet their quality \r\n[L1046] standards before shipping them to retail stores. Since \r\n[L1047] it takes about 10 minutes to inspect an individual \r\n[L1048] phone\u2019s display screen, managers decide to inspect a \r\n[L1049] sample of 20 phones from the day\u2019s production.\r\n[L1050] (a) Explain why it would be difficult for managers to \r\n[L1051] inspect an SRS of 20 iPhones that are produced today.\r\n[L1052] (b) An eager employee suggests that it would be easy \r\n[L1053] to inspect the last 20 iPhones that were produced \r\n[L1054] today. Why isn\u2019t this a good idea?\r\n[L1055] (c) Another employee recommends inspecting every \r\n[L1056] fiftieth iPhone that is produced. Explain carefully \r\n[L1057] why this sampling method is not an SRS.\r\n[L1058] 18. Dead trees On the west side of Rocky Mountain \r\n[L1059] National Park, many mature pine trees are dying due \r\n[L1060] to infestation by pine beetles. Scientists would like to \r\n[L1061] use sampling to estimate the proportion of all pine \r\n[L1062] trees in the area that have been infected.\r\n[L1063] (a) Explain why it wouldn\u2019t be practical for scientists \r\n[L1064] to obtain an SRS in this setting.\r\n[L1065] (b) A possible alternative would be to use every pine \r\n[L1066] tree along the park\u2019s main road as a sample. Why is \r\n[L1067] this sampling method biased?\r\n[L1068] (c) Suppose that a more complicated random sam\ufffepling plan is carried out, and that 35% of the pine trees \r\n[L1069] in the sample are infested by the pine beetle. Can \r\n[L1070] scientists conclude that 35% of all the pine trees on the \r\n[L1071] west side of the park are infested? Why or why not?\r\n[L1072] 19. Who goes to the convention? A club has 30 student \r\n[L1073] members and 10 faculty members. The students are\r\n[L1074] Abel Fisher Huber Miranda Reinmann\r\n[L1075] Carson Ghosh Jimenez Moskowitz Santos\r\n[L1076] Chen Griswold Jones Neyman Shaw\r\n[L1077] David Hein Kim O\u2019Brien Thompson\r\n[L1078] Deming Hernandez Klotz Pearl Utts\r\n[L1079] Elashoff Holland Liu Potter Varga\r\n[L1080] The faculty members are\r\n[L1081] Andrews Fernandez Kim Moore West\r\n[L1082] Besicovitch Gupta Lightman Phillips Yang","[L1083] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>","[L1084] 228 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1085] The club can send 4 students and 2 faculty members \r\n[L1086] to a convention. It decides to choose those who will \r\n[L1087] go by random selection. How will you label the two \r\n[L1088] strata? Use Table D, beginning at line 123, to choose \r\n[L1089] a stratified random sample of 4 students and 2 faculty \r\n[L1090] members.\r\n[L1091] 20. Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\n[L1092] stratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\n[L1093] records of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\n[L1094] stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\n[L1095] and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\n[L1096] One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\n[L1097] these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\n[L1098] amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000. Using these \r\n[L1099] groups as strata, you decide to verify all the largest \r\n[L1100] accounts and to sample 5% of the midsize accounts \r\n[L1101] and 1% of the small accounts. How would you label \r\n[L1102] the two strata from which you will sample? Use Table \r\n[L1103] D, starting at line 115, to select only the first 3 \r\n[L1104] accounts from each of these strata.\r\n[L1105] 21. Go Blue! Michigan Stadium, also known as \u201cThe Big \r\n[L1106] House,\u201d seats over 100,000 fans for a football game. \r\n[L1107] The University of Michigan athletic department plans \r\n[L1108] to conduct a survey about concessions that are sold \r\n[L1109] during games. Tickets are most expensive for seats \r\n[L1110] near the field and on the sideline. The cheapest seats \r\n[L1111] are high up in the end zones (where one of the au\ufffethors sat as a student).

The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L1153] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L1154] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L1155] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L1156] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L1157] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L1158] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L1159] might be preferable to an SRS in this case. What \r\n[L1160] would you use as strata?\r\n[L1161] (b) Why might a cluster sample be a simpler option? \r\n[L1162] What would you use as clusters?\r\n[L1163] 23. Is it an SRS? A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L1164] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L1165] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L1166] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L1167] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L1168] Explain your answer.\r\n[L1169] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L1170] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L1171] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L1172] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L1173] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L1174] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L1175] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L1176] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L1177] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L1178] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L1179] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L1180] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L1181] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L1182] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L1183] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L1184] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L1185] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L1186] method?\r\n[L1187] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L1188] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L1189] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L1190] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L1191] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L1192] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L1193] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L1194] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1195] sample.\r\n[L1196] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L1197] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L1198] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L1199] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L1200] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L1201] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L1202] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L1203] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L1204] pg 218","[L1205] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1206] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","[L1207] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L1208] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1209] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200.

Then explain carefully why a system\ufffeatic sample is not an SRS.\r\n[L1214] 27. Sampling frame Ideally, the sampling frame in a \r\n[L1215] sample survey should list every individual in the \r\n[L1216] population, but in practice, this is often difficult. \r\n[L1217] Suppose that a sample of households in a community \r\n[L1218] is selected at random from the telephone directory. \r\n[L1219] Explain how this sampling method results in under\ufffecoverage that could lead to bias.\r\n[L1220] 28. Sampling frame Refer to the previous exercise. It is \r\n[L1221] more common in telephone surveys to use random \r\n[L1222] digit dialing equipment that selects the last four digits \r\n[L1223] of a telephone number at random after being given \r\n[L1224] the exchange (the first three digits).

You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\n[L1230] to conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\n[L1231] allow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\n[L1232] seats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\n[L1233] you randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\n[L1234] stadium. During the game, you ask the fans in those \r\n[L1235] seats how much they spent that day.\r\n[L1236] (a) Provide a reason why this survey might yield a \r\n[L1237] biased result.\r\n[L1238] (b) Explain whether the reason you provided in (a) is \r\n[L1239] a sampling error or a nonsampling error.\r\n[L1240] 30.

Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\n[L1248] sampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\n[L1249] the United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n[L1250] 5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\n[L1251] estimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n[L1252] (a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n[L1253] (b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\n[L1254] survey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n[L1255] 32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\n[L1256] in telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\n[L1257] call is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\n[L1258] The Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\n[L1259] nonresponse to a government survey of households \r\n[L1260] in Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\n[L1261] July 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\n[L1262] and 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\n[L1263] period versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\n[L1264] period.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\n[L1265] rate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\n[L1266] nonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n[L1267] 33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n[L1268] 31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\n[L1269] answer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\n[L1270] drove through, how many of them were red when you \r\n[L1271] entered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n[L1272] 171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\n[L1273] practical problem with this survey is that people may \r\n[L1274] not give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\n[L1275] of the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n[L1276] 880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n[L1277] 34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\n[L1278] belt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\n[L1279] chosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\n[L1280] they were invited to answer questions that included \r\n[L1281] questions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\n[L1282] always used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\n[L1283] seat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\n[L1284] lots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey.

Sample surveys are one kind of observational\r\n[L1406] study. Other observational studies watch the behavior of animals in the wild or the \r\n[L1407] interactions between teacher and students in the classroom. This section is about \r\n[L1408] statistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\n[L1409] Observational Study versus Experiment\r\n[L1410] In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\n[L1411] ask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\n[L1412] response. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\n[L1413] of a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\n[L1414] DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\n[L1415] An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\n[L1416] does not attempt to influence the responses.\r\n[L1417] An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\n[L1418] responses.\r\n[L1419] The goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\n[L1420] to compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\n[L1421] of an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\n[L1422] response. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\n[L1423] way to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\n[L1424] see the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\n[L1425] is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\n[L1426] data. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\n[L1427] is one of the most important in statistics.\r\n[L1428] Does Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\n[L1429] after Menopause?\r\n[L1430] Observation versus experiment\r\n[L1431] Should women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\n[L1432] production of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\n[L1433] a heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\n[L1434] small compared with the benefits.\r\n[L1435] The evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\n[L1436] hormones with others who were not. But the women who chose to \r\n[L1437] take hormones were richer and better educated and saw doctors \r\n[L1438] more often than women who didn\u2019t take hormones.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L1466] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L1467] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L1468] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L1469] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L1470] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L1471] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L1472] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L1473] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L1474] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L1475] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L1476] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L1477] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L1478] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L1479] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L1480] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L1481] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L1482] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L1483] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L1484] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L1485] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L1486] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L1487] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L1488] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L1489] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L1490] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L1491] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L1492] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L1493] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L1494] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L1495] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L1496] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L1497] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","[L1498] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1499] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","[L1500] Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L1501] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L1502] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L1503] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L1504] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L1505] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L1506] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L1507] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L1508] results of the earlier observational studies.

Suggest a lurking variable that may be confounded \r\n[L1523] with whether families eat dinner together.\r\n[L1524] The Language of Experiments\r\n[L1525] An experiment is a statistical study in which we actually do something (a treat\ufffement) to people, animals, or objects (the experimental units) to observe the re\ufffesponse. Here is the basic vocabulary of experiments.\r\n[L1526] DEFINITION: Treatment, experimental units, subjects\r\n[L1527] A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment.\r\n[L1528] If an experiment has several explanatory variables, a treatment is a combination of \r\n[L1529] specific values of these variables.\r\n[L1530] The experimental units are the smallest collection of individuals to which treatments \r\n[L1531] are applied. When the units are human beings, they often are called subjects.\r\n[L1532] The best way to learn the language of experiments is to practice using it.\r\n[L1533] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1534] are asked to identify a \r\n[L1535] possible confounding \r\n[L1536] variable in a given \r\n[L1537] setting, you are \r\n[L1538] expected to explain how \r\n[L1539] the variable you choose \r\n[L1540] (1) is associated with \r\n[L1541] the explanatory variable \r\n[L1542] and (2) affects the \r\n[L1543] response variable.","[L1544] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1545] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>","[L1546] 234 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1547] EXAMPLE When Will I Ever Use This Stuff?\r\n[L1548] Vocabulary of experiments\r\n[L1549] Researchers at the University of North Carolina were concerned about the \r\n[L1550] increasing dropout rate in the state\u2019s high schools, especially for low-income stu\ufffedents. Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\n[L1551] started to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\n[L1552] To change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\n[L1553] the topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\n[L1554] To test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\n[L1555] the schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\n[L1556] standard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\n[L1557] curriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\n[L1558] years, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\n[L1559] scores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\n[L1560] high school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\n[L1561] greater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\n[L1562] PROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\n[L1563] in the CareerStart experiment.\r\n[L1564] SOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\n[L1565] variable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\n[L1566] compares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\n[L1567] behavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\n[L1568] The previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\n[L1569] trying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\n[L1570] all 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\n[L1571] of schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\n[L1572] researchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\n[L1573] systematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\n[L1574] students from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\n[L1575] program made the difference.\r\n[L1576] Sometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\n[L1577] experiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\n[L1578] treatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\n[L1579] the factors. Here\u2019s an example of a multifactor experiment.\r\n[L1580] Factors\r\n[L1581] Level\r\n[L1582] For Practice Try Exercise 51","[L1583] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://26b92d516ab78a7#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_29.jpg","size_bytes":63833,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1584] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>","[L1585] Section 4.2 Experiments 235\r\n[L1586] EXAMPLE TV Advertising\r\n[L1587] Experiments with multiple explanatory variables\r\n[L1588] What are the effects of repeated exposure to an advertising message? The answer \r\n[L1589] may depend on both the length of the ad and on how often it is repeat\ufffeed. An experiment investigated this question using undergraduate stu\ufffedents as subjects. All subjects viewed a 40-minute television program \r\n[L1590] that included ads for a digital camera. Some subjects saw a 30-second \r\n[L1591] commercial; others, a 90-second version. The same commercial was \r\n[L1592] shown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After viewing, all the \r\n[L1593] subjects answered questions about their recall of the ad, their attitude \r\n[L1594] toward the camera, and their intention to purchase it.21\r\n[L1595] PROBLEM: For the advertising study,\r\n[L1596] (a) identify the explanatory and response variables, and\r\n[L1597] (b) list all the treatments.\r\n[L1598] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1599] (a) This experiment has 2 explanatory variables (factors): \r\n[L1600] length of the commercial and number of repetitions. The response \r\n[L1601] variables include measures of subjects\u2019 recall of the ad, their \r\n[L1602] attitudes about the digital camera, and whether they intend to \r\n[L1603] purchase it.\r\n[L1604] (b) There are 2 different lengths of commercial (30 and 90 seconds) \r\n[L1605] and three different numbers of repetitions (1, 3, and 5). The 6 combi\ufffenations consisting of one level of each factor form the 6 treatments \r\n[L1606] shown in Figure 4.3: (1) 30 seconds, 1 time; (2) 30 seconds, 3 times; \r\n[L1607] (3) 30 seconds, 5 times; (4) 90 seconds, 1 time; (5) 90 seconds, \r\n[L1608] 3 times; (6) 90 seconds, 5 times.\r\n[L1609] This example shows how experiments allow us to study the combined effect of \r\n[L1610] several factors. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\n[L1611] not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\n[L1612] commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\n[L1613] interest. But if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers \r\n[L1614] get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. The two-factor experiment in \r\n[L1615] the TV advertising example will help us find out.\r\n[L1616] How to Experiment Badly \r\n[L1617] Experiments are the preferred method for examining the effect of one variable on \r\n[L1618] another. By imposing the specific treatment of interest and controlling other \r\n[L1619] influences, we can pin down cause and effect. Good designs are essential for \r\n[L1620] effective experiments, just as they are for sampling.

This year, budget cuts will allow the school to offer only an \r\n[L1649] online version of the course. Over the past 10 years, the average SAT \r\n[L1650] score of students in the classroom course was 1620. The online group \r\n[L1651] gets an average score of 1780. That\u2019s roughly 10% higher than the long\ufffetime average for those who took the classroom review course. Is the \r\n[L1652] online course more effective?\r\n[L1653] This experiment has a very simple design. A group of subjects (the \r\n[L1654] students) were exposed to a treatment (the online course), and the \r\n[L1655] outcome (SAT scores) was observed. Here is the design:\r\n[L1656] Students \u2192 Online course \u2192 SAT scores\r\n[L1657] A closer look showed that the students in the online review course \r\n[L1658] were quite different from the students who took the classroom course \r\n[L1659] in past years. They had higher GPAs and were taking more AP classes.\r\n[L1660] The effect of online versus in-class instruction is mixed up with the \r\n[L1661] effect of these lurking variables. Maybe the online students earned \r\n[L1662] higher SAT scores because they were smarter to begin with, not \r\n[L1663] because the online course prepared them better. This confounding \r\n[L1664] prevents us from concluding that the online course is more effective than class\uffferoom instruction.\r\n[L1665] Many laboratory experiments use a design like the one in the online SAT course \r\n[L1666] example:\r\n[L1667] Experimental units \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Measure response\r\n[L1668] In the lab environment, simple designs often work well. Field experiments and \r\n[L1669] experiments with animals or people deal with more variable conditions.

Most well-designed experiments compare \r\n[L1675] two or more treatments.\r\n[L1676] Comparison alone isn\u2019t enough to produce results we can trust. If the treat\ufffements are given to groups that differ greatly when the experiment begins, bias will \r\n[L1677] result.

The solution to the problem of bias in sampling is \r\n[L1684] random selection. In experiments, the solution is random assignment.\r\n[L1685] DEFINITION: Random assignment\r\n[L1686] In an experiment, random assignment means that experimental units are assigned to \r\n[L1687] treatments at random, that is, using some sort of chance process.\r\n[L1688] Let\u2019s look at how random assignment can be used to improve the design of the \r\n[L1689] SAT prep course experiment.\r\n[L1690] SAT Prep: Online versus Classroom\r\n[L1691] How random assignment works\r\n[L1692] This year, the high school has enough budget money to compare the \r\n[L1693] online SAT course with traditional classroom instruction. Fifty students \r\n[L1694] have agreed to participate in an experiment comparing the two instruc\ufffetional methods.\r\n[L1695] PROBLEM: Describe how you would randomly assign 25 students to each of the two \r\n[L1696] methods:\r\n[L1697] (a) Using 50 identical slips of paper\r\n[L1698] (b) Using Table D\r\n[L1699] (c) Using technology\r\n[L1700] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1701] (a) The simplest way would be to use the \u201chat method.\u201d Write each subject\u2019s name on \r\n[L1702] one of the slips. Put all the slips in a hat and mix them thoroughly. Draw them out one \r\n[L1703] at a time until you have 25 slips. These 25 students will take the online course. The \r\n[L1704] remaining 25 students will take the classroom course. Alternatively, you could write \r\n[L1705] \u201conline\u201d on 25 of the slips and \u201cclassroom\u201d on the other 25 slips. Then put the slips in \r\n[L1706] a hat and mix them well. Have students come up one by one and (without looking) pick a slip from the \r\n[L1707] hat. This guarantees 25 students per group, with the treatments assigned by chance.\r\n[L1708] (b) We can use the two-step process from random sampling to do the random assignment.\r\n[L1709] Step 1: Label. Give labels 01, 02, 03, . . . , 49, 50 to the subjects in alphabetical order by last \r\n[L1710] name.\r\n[L1711] Step 2: Table.

It is randomized because the sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments by chance. The diagram in Figure 4.4 presents \r\n[L1725] the details: random assignment, the sizes of the groups and which treatment they \r\n[L1726] receive, and the response variable. There are, as we will see later, statistical rea\ufffesons for using treatment groups that are about equal in size. This type of design is \r\n[L1727] called a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1728] 50 volunteer\r\n[L1729] students\r\n[L1730] Random\r\n[L1731] assignment\r\n[L1732] Group 1\r\n[L1733] 25 students\r\n[L1734] Group 2\r\n[L1735] 25 students\r\n[L1736] Compare\r\n[L1737] SAT scores\r\n[L1738] Treatment 2\r\n[L1739] Classroom\r\n[L1740] Treatment 1\r\n[L1741] Online\r\n[L1742] FIGURE 4.4 Outline of a completely randomized design to compare online and classroom \r\n[L1743] instruction.\r\n[L1744] DEFINITION: Completely randomized design\r\n[L1745] In a completely randomized design, the treatments are assigned to all the experimen\ufffetal units completely by chance.\r\n[L1746] Notice that the definition of a completely randomized design does not require \r\n[L1747] that each treatment be assigned to an equal number of experimental units. It does \r\n[L1748] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L1749] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L1750] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L1751] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L1752] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L1753] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L1754] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1755] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L1756] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L1757] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L1758] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L1759] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L1760] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L1761] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L1762] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L1763] than it really is.\r\n[L1764] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments.

The remaining 20 houses will be given \r\n[L1811] information about energy consumption but no way to monitor their usage. At the end of the year, \r\n[L1812] compare how much electricity was used by the homes in the three groups.\r\n[L1813] Why did we include a control group of 20 houses in the energy conservation \r\n[L1814] experiment? The primary purpose of a control group is to provide a baseline for \r\n[L1815] comparing the effects of the other treatments. Without such a comparison group, \r\n[L1816] we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell whether homes with digital displays or charts used less \r\n[L1817] electricity than homes without such aids.\r\n[L1818] Control group\r\n[L1819] For Practice Try Exercise 61\r\n[L1820] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1821] are asked to describe \r\n[L1822] the design of an experi\ufffement on the AP exam, \r\n[L1823] you won\u2019t get full credit \r\n[L1824] for a diagram like Figure \r\n[L1825] 4.5.

You might be thinking that the change \r\n[L1843] in electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\n[L1844] would tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\n[L1845] Suppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\n[L1846] households might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\n[L1847] whether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\n[L1848] confounding?!)\r\n[L1849] Many experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\n[L1850] group that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\n[L1851] an active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\n[L1852] developed drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\n[L1853] work. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\n[L1854] control group.\r\n[L1855] Some experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group. That\u2019s appropriate \r\n[L1856] if researchers simply want to compare the effects of several treatments, and not \r\n[L1857] to determine whether any of them works better than an inactive treatment. For \r\n[L1858] instance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\n[L1859] of paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\n[L1860] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L1861] Music students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately. Can small-group \r\n[L1862] discussions help? The subjects were 29 students preparing for the end-of-semester per\ufffeformance that is an important part of their grade. Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L1863] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L1864] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L1865] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L1866] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L1867] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment. Follow the model of \r\n[L1868] Figure 4.4.\r\n[L1869] 2. Describe how you would carry out the random assignment. Provide enough detail that \r\n[L1870] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L1871] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L1872] Three Principles of \r\n[L1873] Experimental Design\r\n[L1874] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L1875] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L1876] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L1877] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L1878] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1879] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L1880] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L1881] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L1882] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1883] ?\r\n[L1884] THINK\r\n[L1885] ABOUT\r\n[L1886] IT","[L1887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","[L1888] Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L1889] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1890] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L1891] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L1892] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L1893] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L1894] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L1895] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L1896] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L1897] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L1898] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L1899] between the groups.\r\n[L1900] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L1901] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L1902] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L1903] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L1904] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L1905] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L1906] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L1907] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L1908] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L1909] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L1910] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L1911] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L1912] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L1913] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L1914] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L1915] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L1916] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L1917] experiment.\r\n[L1918] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L1919] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L1920] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks? The Phy\ufffesicians\u2019 Health Study was a medical experiment that helped answer this ques\ufffetion. In fact, the Physicians\u2019 Health Study looked at the effects of two drugs: \r\n[L1921] aspirin and beta-carotene. Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\n[L1922] help prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\n[L1923] male physicians. There were two explanatory variables (factors), each having \r\n[L1924] two levels: aspirin (yes or no) and beta-carotene (yes or no). Combinations of \r\n[L1925] Replication","[L1926] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6cc54f74ebd50cc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_36.jpg","size_bytes":62028,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1927] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>","[L1928] 242 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1929] For Practice Try Exercise 67\r\n[L1930] the levels of these factors form the four treatments shown in Figure 4.6. One\ufffefourth of the subjects were assigned at random to each of these treatments.\r\n[L1931] On odd-numbered days, the subjects took either a tablet that contained as\ufffepirin or a dummy pill that looked and tasted like the aspirin but had no \r\n[L1932] active ingredient (a placebo). On even-numbered days, they took either a \r\n[L1933] capsule containing beta-carotene or a placebo. There were several response \r\n[L1934] variables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\n[L1935] other medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\n[L1936] only 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\n[L1937] large enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\n[L1938] attacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\n[L1939] preventing cancer.\r\n[L1940] PROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\n[L1941] design was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\n[L1942] SOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\n[L1943] lurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\n[L1944] treatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\n[L1945] schedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\n[L1946] which subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\n[L1947] helped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\n[L1948] begin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\n[L1949] replication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\n[L1950] the groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\n[L1951] the random assignment.\r\n[L1952] The control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n[L1953] (placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\n[L1954] Experiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L1955] The logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\n[L1956] all the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\n[L1957] that all subjects really are treated identically.\r\n[L1958] If some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\n[L1959] group takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\n[L1960] the subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\n[L1961] experiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\n[L1962] On even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo. Many patients respond favorably to any treatment, even a placebo, perhaps \r\n[L1963] because they trust the doctor. The response to a dummy treatment is called the \r\n[L1964] Placebo\r\n[L1965] Factor 1:\r\n[L1966] Aspirin\r\n[L1967] Factor 2: Beta-carotene\r\n[L1968] Yes\r\n[L1969] Yes No\r\n[L1970] Aspirin Beta-carotene Aspirin Placebo\r\n[L1971] No\r\n[L1972] Placebo Beta-carotene Placebo Placebo\r\n[L1973] FIGURE 4.6 The treatments in the \r\n[L1974] Physicians\u2019 Health Study.","[L1975] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b06f1b5c1816f6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_37.jpg","size_bytes":61000,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1976] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>","[L1977] Section 4.2 Experiments 243\r\n[L1978] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1979] placebo effect. If some subjects did not take any pills, the effect of aspirin or \r\n[L1980] beta-carotene would be confounded with the placebo effect, the effect of simply \r\n[L1981] taking pills.\r\n[L1982] Curing Baldness and Soothing Pain\r\n[L1983] Do placebos work?\r\n[L1984] Want to help balding men keep their hair? Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\n[L1985] that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\n[L1986] heads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n[L1987] 24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\n[L1988] active medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\n[L1989] the pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\n[L1990] significantly less pain.24\r\n[L1991] When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\n[L1992] that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\n[L1993] placebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\n[L1994] treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\n[L1995] enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\n[L1996] place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\n[L1997] The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\n[L1998] their hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\n[L1999] beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\n[L2000] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L2001] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L2002] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L2003] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L2004] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L2005] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L2006] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L2007] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L2008] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L2009] Placebo effect","[L2010] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2011] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>","[L2012] 244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2013] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L2014] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L2015] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L2016] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L2017] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L2018] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L2019] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L2020] the response variable do know.\r\n[L2021] Single-blind\r\n[L2022] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L2023] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L2024] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L2025] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L2026] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L2027] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L2028] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L2029] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\n[L2030] received the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n[L2031] 1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n[L2032] 2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n[L2033] 3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L2034] experiment.\r\n[L2035] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L2036] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L2037] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L2038] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L2039] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L2040] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L2041] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L2042] significant.\r\n[L2043] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L2044] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L2045] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L2046] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L2047] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation.

David Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah \r\n[L2055] designed an experiment to help answer this question. They used 48 un\ufffedergraduate students as subjects. The researchers randomly assigned half \r\n[L2056] of the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\n[L2057] the other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger. One \r\n[L2058] response variable was whether the driver stopped at a rest area that was \r\n[L2059] specified by researchers before the simulation started.

Since \r\n[L2070] we\u2019re assuming that the treatment received won\u2019t change whether each driver \r\n[L2071] stops at the rest area, we use 33 cards to represent drivers who stop and 15 cards \r\n[L2072] to represent those who don\u2019t.

Let\u2019s return \r\n[L2104] to the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\n[L2105] one group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L2106] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L2107] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L2108] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L2109] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L2110] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L2111] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L2112] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L2113] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L2114] response to the treatments.\r\n[L2115] Blocking\r\n[L2116] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L2117] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L2118] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L2119] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L2120] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

The response variable is a cleanli\ufffeness rating on a scale of 0 (very dirty) to 10 (very clean). How \r\n[L2132] should researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water? They could \r\n[L2133] use a completely randomized design and hope that the \r\n[L2134] random assignment distributes the light-colored clothing \r\n[L2135] about evenly between the cold- and warm-water treatment \r\n[L2136] groups.

They control the effects of some outside \r\n[L2181] variables by bringing those variables into the experiment to form the blocks. \r\n[L2182] A randomized block design allows us to draw separate conclusions about each \r\n[L2183] block, for example, about light-colored and dark-colored clothes in the laundry \r\n[L2184] experiment.

A wise experimenter will form blocks based on the most important un\ufffeavoidable sources of variability (lurking variables) among the experimental units. \r\n[L2193] Randomization will then average out the effects of the remaining lurking vari\ufffeables and allow an unbiased comparison of the treatments.

This ignores the differences between men and women, which would probably result in a great \r\n[L2220] deal of variability in responses to the advertising in all three groups.

The idea is to create blocks by matching pairs of similar \r\n[L2262] experimental units. Then we can use chance to decide which member of a pair \r\n[L2263] gets the first treatment. The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L2264] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L2265] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L2266] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L2267] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L2268] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L2269] Matched pairs design\r\n[L2270] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L2271] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L2272] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L2273] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L2274] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L2275] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L2276] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L2277] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L2278] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L2279] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L2280] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L2281] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L2282] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L2283] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L2284] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L2285] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates?

Completely randomized design For the first experiment, you\u2019ll randomly \r\n[L2288] assign half of the students in your class to stand and the other half to sit.

Since you already sat or stood in Step 1, \r\n[L2295] you just need to do the opposite now. As before, everyone should measure their \r\n[L2296] pulses for one minute after completing the treatment (that is, once they are \r\n[L2297] standing or sitting).

Make a dotplot of these differences and cal\ufffeculate their mean. Is there evidence that standing pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2308] 5. What advantage does the matched pairs design have over the completely \r\n[L2309] randomized design?\r\n[L2310] An AP Statistics class with 24 students performed the \u201cGet Your Heart Beating\u201d \r\n[L2311] Activity. We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\n[L2312] EXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\n[L2313] Design determines analysis\r\n[L2314] A Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\n[L2315] randomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\n[L2316] standing group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n[L2317] 68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\n[L2318] higher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\n[L2319] pulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\n[L2320] graph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\n[L2321] standing pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\n[L2322] What about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\n[L2323] Fathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\n[L2324] rates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\n[L2325] difference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n[L2326] 24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\n[L2327] standing pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\n[L2328] evidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\n[L2329] Let\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\n[L2330] that we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\n[L2331] experimental designs. Blocking by subject in the matched pairs design greatly \r\n[L2332] reduced the variability in the response variable. That made it easier to detect \r\n[L2333] the fact that standing causes an increase in pulse rate. With the large amount \r\n[L2334] of variability in the completely randomized design, we were unable to draw \r\n[L2335] such a conclusion.","[L2336] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5c9678406de9a79#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_45.jpg","size_bytes":52515,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2337] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 47 / 75>","[L2338] Section 4.2 Experiments 251\r\n[L2339] Another important lesson to take away from the example is this: the design of the \r\n[L2340] study determines the appropriate method of analysis. For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\n[L2341] dotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\n[L2342] compare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\n[L2343] The following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\n[L2344] analyzing data from an experiment.\r\n[L2345] DATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\n[L2346] Most automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n[L2347] 78% nitrogen.

Could filling automobile tires with nitrogen improve safety, perfor\ufffemance, or both?\r\n[L2349] Consumers Union designed a study to test whether nitrogen-filled tires would \r\n[L2350] maintain pressure better than air-filled tires.

Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\n[L2384] be distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\n[L2385] experiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\n[L2386] actually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\n[L2387] variable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\n[L2388] s In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\n[L2389] is a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\n[L2390] s The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\n[L2391] manner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\n[L2392] principles of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\n[L2393] assignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\n[L2394] s The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\n[L2395] two or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\n[L2396] with other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\n[L2397] s Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\n[L2398] Random assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\n[L2399] chance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\n[L2400] comparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\n[L2401] s Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\n[L2402] reduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\n[L2403] likely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\n[L2404] s Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\n[L2405] neither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\n[L2406] responses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\n[L2407] the other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\n[L2408] s Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\n[L2409] That helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\n[L2410] patients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\n[L2411] they have received an inactive treatment.\r\n[L2412] s In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\n[L2413] individuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\n[L2414] Randomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\n[L2415] helps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\n[L2416] s Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\n[L2417] treatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\n[L2418] treatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\n[L2419] closely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\n[L2420] Summary SECTION 4.2","[L2421] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","[L2423] Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n[L2424] 45.

Researchers began by \r\n[L2428] asking 305 healthy pregnant women to report their \r\n[L2429] chocolate consumption. Six months after birth, the \r\n[L2430] researchers asked mothers to rate their infants\u2019 tem\ufffeperament, including smiling, laughter, and fear.

Learning biology with computers An educator wants \r\n[L2452] to compare the effectiveness of computer software for \r\n[L2453] teaching biology with that of a textbook presentation. \r\n[L2454] She gives a biology pretest to each of a group of high \r\n[L2455] school juniors, then randomly divides them into \r\n[L2456] two groups. One group uses the computer, and the \r\n[L2457] other studies the text.

Cell phones and brain cancer One study of cell \r\n[L2467] phones and the risk of brain cancer looked at a group \r\n[L2468] of 469 people who have brain cancer. The investiga\ufffetors matched each cancer patient with a person of \r\n[L2469] the same age, gender, and race who did not have \r\n[L2470] brain cancer, then asked about the use of cell phones. \r\n[L2471] Result: \u201cOur data suggest that the use of handheld \r\n[L2472] cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain \r\n[L2473] cancer.\u201d32\r\n[L2474] (a) Is this an observational study or an experiment? \r\n[L2475] Justify your answer.\r\n[L2476] (b) Based on this study, would you conclude that cell \r\n[L2477] phones do not increase the risk of brain cancer?

Effects of class size Do smaller classes in elementary \r\n[L2480] school really benefit students in areas such as scores \r\n[L2481] on standardized tests, staying in school, and going on \r\n[L2482] to college? We might do an observational study that \r\n[L2483] compares students who happened to be in smaller \r\n[L2484] and larger classes in their early school years. Identify \r\n[L2485] a lurking variable that may lead to confounding with \r\n[L2486] the effects of small classes. Explain how confounding \r\n[L2487] might occur.\r\n[L2488] 50. Effects of binge drinking A common definition of \r\n[L2489] \u201cbinge drinking\u201d is 5 or more drinks at one sitting for \r\n[L2490] men and 4 or more for women. An observational study \r\n[L2491] finds that students who binge drink have lower average \r\n[L2492] GPA than those who don\u2019t. Identify a lurking variable \r\n[L2493] that may be confounded with the effects of binge \r\n[L2494] drinking.

Growing in the shade Ability to grow in shade may \r\n[L2499] help pines found in the dry forests of Arizona to resist \r\n[L2500] drought. How well do these pines grow in shade? \r\n[L2501] Investigators planted pine seedlings in a greenhouse \r\n[L2502] in either full light, light reduced to 25% of normal \r\n[L2503] by shade cloth, or light reduced to 5% of normal.

Some students \r\n[L2517] will pay a low flat rate. Others will pay higher rates at \r\n[L2518] peak periods and very low rates off-peak. The univer\ufffesity is interested in the amount and time of use and in \r\n[L2519] the effect on the congestion of the network.\r\n[L2520] 53. Improving response rate How can we reduce the \r\n[L2521] rate of refusals in telephone surveys? Most people \r\n[L2522] who answer at all listen to the interviewer\u2019s introduc\ufffetory remarks and then decide whether to continue. \r\n[L2523] One study made telephone calls to randomly selected \r\n[L2524] households to ask opinions about the next election. In \r\n[L2525] some calls, the interviewer gave her name, in others \r\n[L2526] she identified the university she was representing, \r\n[L2527] and in still others she identified both herself and the \r\n[L2528] university. For each type of call, the interviewer either \r\n[L2529] did or did not offer to send a copy of the final survey \r\n[L2530] results to the person interviewed. Do these differences \r\n[L2531] in the introduction affect whether the interview is \r\n[L2532] completed?\r\n[L2533] 54. Eat well and exercise Most American adolescents \r\n[L2534] don\u2019t eat well and don\u2019t exercise enough. Can middle \r\n[L2535] schools increase physical activity among \r\n[L2536] their students? Can they persuade students to eat \r\n[L2537] better? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\n[L2538] intervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\n[L2539] school day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\n[L2540] for healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\n[L2541] school was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention. The \r\n[L2542] investigators observed physical activity and lunchtime \r\n[L2543] consumption of fat.\r\n[L2544] 55. Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\n[L2545] will use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\n[L2546] raise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\n[L2547] either 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n[L2548] 150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\n[L2549] combinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\n[L2550] fabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\n[L2551] for quality.\r\n[L2552] 56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\n[L2553] the increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\n[L2554] they stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\n[L2555] beat of a metronome. The step was either 5.75 or 11.5 \r\n[L2556] inches high and the metronome beat was 14, 21, or \r\n[L2557] 28 steps per minute. Five students stepped at each \r\n[L2558] combination of height and speed.\r\n[L2559] 57. Cocoa and blood flow A study conducted by Nor\ufffeman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham \r\n[L2560] and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, \r\n[L2561] involved 27 healthy people aged 18 to 72. Each \r\n[L2562] subject consumed a cocoa beverage containing 900 \r\n[L2563] milligrams of flavonols (a class of flavonoids) daily \r\n[L2564] for five days. Using a finger cuff, blood flow was mea\ufffesured on the first and fifth days of the study. After five \r\n[L2565] days, researchers measured what they called \u201csignifi\ufffecant improvement\u201d in blood flow and the function of \r\n[L2566] the cells that line the blood vessels.33 What flaw in the \r\n[L2567] design of this experiment makes it impossible to say \r\n[L2568] whether the cocoa really caused the improved blood \r\n[L2569] flow? Explain.\r\n[L2570] 58. Reducing unemployment Will cash bonuses speed \r\n[L2571] the return to work of unemployed people? A state \r\n[L2572] department of labor notes that last year 68% of people \r\n[L2573] who filed claims for unemployment insurance found \r\n[L2574] a new job within 15 weeks. As an experiment, this year \r\n[L2575] the state offers $500 to people filing unemployment \r\n[L2576] claims if they find a job within 15 weeks. The percent \r\n[L2577] who do so increases to 77%. What flaw in the design \r\n[L2578] of this experiment makes it impossible to say whether \r\n[L2579] the bonus really caused the increase? Explain.\r\n[L2580] 59. Layoffs and \u201csurvivor guilt\u201d Workers who survive a \r\n[L2581] layoff of other employees at their location may suffer \r\n[L2582] from \u201csurvivor guilt.\u201d A study of survivor guilt and \r\n[L2583] its effects used as subjects 120 students who were \r\n[L2584] offered an opportunity to earn extra course credit by \r\n[L2585] doing proofreading. Each subject worked in the same \r\n[L2586] cubicle as another student, who was an accomplice \r\n[L2587] of the experimenters. At a break midway through the \r\n[L2588] work, one of three things happened:\r\n[L2589] Treatment 1: The accomplice was told to leave; it was \r\n[L2590] explained that this was because she performed poorly.\r\n[L2591] Treatment 2: It was explained that unforeseen circum\ufffestances meant there was only enough work for one \r\n[L2592] person. By \u201cchance,\u201d the accomplice was chosen to \r\n[L2593] be laid off.\r\n[L2594] Treatment 3: Both students continued to work after \r\n[L2595] the break.\r\n[L2596] The subjects\u2019 work performance after the break \r\n[L2597] was compared with performance before the break.34\r\n[L2598] Describe how you would randomly assign the \r\n[L2599] subjects to the treatments\r\n[L2600] (a) using slips of paper.\r\n[L2601] (b) using Table D.\r\n[L2602] (c) using technology.\r\n[L2603] 60.

Headache relief Doctors identify \u201cchronic tension\ufffetype headaches\u201d as headaches that occur almost \r\n[L2615] daily for at least six months. Can antidepressant \r\n[L2616] medications or stress management training reduce \r\n[L2617] the number and severity of these headaches? Are both \r\n[L2618] together more effective than either alone? Investiga\ufffetors compared four treatments: antidepressant alone, \r\n[L2619] placebo alone, antidepressant plus stress manage\ufffement, and placebo plus stress management.

The changing climate will \r\n[L2634] probably bring more rain to California, but we don\u2019t \r\n[L2635] know whether the additional rain will come during the \r\n[L2636] winter wet season or extend into the long dry season in \r\n[L2637] spring and summer. Kenwyn Suttle of the University \r\n[L2638] of California at Berkeley and his coworkers carried \r\n[L2639] out an experiment to study the effects of more rain in \r\n[L2640] either season. They randomly assigned plots of open \r\n[L2641] grassland to 3 treatments: added water equal to 20% of \r\n[L2642] annual rainfall either during January to March (winter) \r\n[L2643] or during April to June (spring), and no added water \r\n[L2644] (control).

Treating prostate disease A large study used records \r\n[L2654] from Canada\u2019s national health care system to com\ufffepare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate \r\n[L2655] disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery \r\n[L2656] and a new method that does not require surgery. The \r\n[L2657] records described many patients whose doctors had \r\n[L2658] chosen each method.

All the infants received \r\n[L2716] nutritional supplements and help from social workers. \r\n[L2717] Half were also assigned at random to an intensive \r\n[L2718] preschool program.38\r\n[L2719] (a) Explain the purpose of each of the three experi\ufffemental design principles.\r\n[L2720] (b) Describe how each of these principles was used \r\n[L2721] in this study.\r\n[L2722] 68. Killing weeds A biologist would like to determine \r\n[L2723] which of two brands of weed killer is less likely to \r\n[L2724] harm the plants in a garden at the university. Before \r\n[L2725] spraying near the plants, the biologist decides to \r\n[L2726] conduct an experiment using 24 individual plants. \r\n[L2727] Which of the following two plans for randomly \r\n[L2728] assigning the treatments should the biologist use? \r\n[L2729] Why?\r\n[L2730] Plan A: Choose the 12 healthiest-looking plants. \r\n[L2731] Apply Brand X weed killer to all 12 of those plants. \r\n[L2732] Apply Brand Y weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2733] Plan B: Choose 12 of the 24 plants at random. Apply \r\n[L2734] Brand X weed killer to those 12 plants and Brand Y \r\n[L2735] weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2736] 69. Do placebos really work? Researchers in Japan \r\n[L2737] conducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\n[L2738] were extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\n[L2739] each subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\n[L2740] told the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\n[L2741] subject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\n[L2742] was poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\n[L2743] the arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n[L2744] 13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\n[L2745] poison ivy leaf.39\r\n[L2746] (a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n[L2747] (b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\n[L2748] idea of a placebo effect.\r\n[L2749] 70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\n[L2750] chronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\n[L2751] and needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\n[L2752] will be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\n[L2753] percent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n[L2754] (a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\n[L2755] drug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n[L2756] (b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\n[L2757] getting the new drug or a placebo? How would this \r\n[L2758] knowledge probably affect their reactions?\r\n[L2759] 71. Meditation for anxiety An experiment that claimed \r\n[L2760] to show that meditation lowers anxiety proceeded as \r\n[L2761] follows. The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\n[L2762] and rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\n[L2763] were randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\n[L2764] meditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\n[L2765] simply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\n[L2766] the experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\n[L2767] and rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\n[L2768] now had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\n[L2769] Explain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\n[L2770] could bias the reported results.\r\n[L2771] 72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\n[L2772] testosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\n[L2773] cause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\n[L2774] fat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\n[L2775] supplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\n[L2776] in the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\n[L2777] with low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\n[L2778] a testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\n[L2779] in the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\n[L2780] described the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\n[L2781] placebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\n[L2782] terms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n[L2783] 73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\n[L2784] determine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\n[L2785] acupuncture could help infertile women become \r\n[L2786] pregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\n[L2787] undergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\n[L2788] were recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\n[L2789] randomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n[L2790] 25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\n[L2791] minutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\n[L2792] were instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\n[L2793] embryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n[L2794] 34 women became pregnant. In the control group, \r\n[L2795] 21 women became pregnant.\r\n[L2796] (a) Describe how the three principles of experimen\ufffetal design were addressed in this study.\r\n[L2797] (b) The difference in the percent of women who \r\n[L2798] became pregnant in the two groups is statistically \r\n[L2799] significant. Explain what this means to someone who \r\n[L2800] knows little statistics.\r\n[L2801] (c) Explain why the placebo effect prevents us from \r\n[L2802] concluding that acupuncture caused the difference in \r\n[L2803] pregnancy rates.\r\n[L2804] pg 241","[L2805] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>","[L2806] Section 4.2 Experiments 257\r\n[L2807] 74. Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\n[L2808] colleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\n[L2809] Half of the participants were randomly assigned \r\n[L2810] to a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\n[L2811] assigned to a low-fat diet. Researchers measured each \r\n[L2812] participant\u2019s change in weight and cholesterol level \r\n[L2813] after six months and again after one year. Subjects in \r\n[L2814] the low-carb diet group lost significantly more weight \r\n[L2815] than subjects in the low-fat diet group during the first \r\n[L2816] six months of the study. At the end of a year, however, \r\n[L2817] the average weight loss for subjects in the two groups \r\n[L2818] was not significantly different.42\r\n[L2819] (a) Why did researchers randomly assign the subjects \r\n[L2820] to the diet treatments?\r\n[L2821] (b) Explain to someone who knows little statistics \r\n[L2822] what \u201clost significantly more weight\u201d means.\r\n[L2823] (c) The subjects in the low-carb diet group lost an aver\ufffeage of 5.1 kg in a year. The subjects in the low-fat diet \r\n[L2824] group lost an average of 3.1 kg. Explain how this infor\ufffemation could be consistent with the fact that weight loss \r\n[L2825] in the two groups was not significantly different.\r\n[L2826] 75. Is yawning contagious? According to the popular \r\n[L2827] TV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\n[L2828] March 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\n[L2829] presented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\n[L2830] subjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\n[L2831] an extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\n[L2832] camera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\n[L2833] seed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\n[L2834] yawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\n[L2835] who had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\n[L2836] given a yawn seed, 10 yawned. Adam Savage and Ja\ufffemie Hyneman, the cohosts of Mythbusters, used these \r\n[L2837] results to conclude that yawning is contagious.\r\n[L2838] (a) Explain how you could use slips of paper to ran\ufffedomly reassign the subjects to the treatment groups.\r\n[L2839] (b) Suppose we used your method in (a) to redo the \r\n[L2840] random assignment 50 times.

The researchers decided to \r\n[L2846] analyze the patients\u2019 final pain ratings. It also makes \r\n[L2847] sense to examine the difference between patients\u2019 \r\n[L2848] initial pain ratings and their final pain ratings in both \r\n[L2849] groups. Here are the data:\r\n[L2850] Active: 10, 6, 1, 10, 6, 8, 5, 5, 6, 8, 7, 8, 7, 6, 4, 4, 7, 10, 6, 10, 6, 5, 5, 1, \r\n[L2851] 0, 0, 0, 0, 1\r\n[L2852] Inactive: 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1\r\n[L2853] (a) Construct a comparative dotplot of the data. \r\n[L2854] Describe what you see.\r\n[L2855] (b) Calculate the mean (average) change in pain \r\n[L2856] rating for each group.

Doctors and nurses Nurse-practitioners are nurses \r\n[L2864] with advanced qualifications who often act much like \r\n[L2865] primary-care physicians. Are they as effective as \r\n[L2866] doctors at treating patients with chronic conditions? \r\n[L2867] An experiment was conducted with 1316 patients \r\n[L2868] who had been diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, or \r\n[L2869] high blood pressure. Within each condition, patients \r\n[L2870] were randomly assigned to either a doctor or a \r\n[L2871] nurse-practitioner. The response variables included \r\n[L2872] measures of the patients\u2019 health and of their \r\n[L2873] satisfaction with their medical care after 6 months.43\r\n[L2874] (a) Which are the blocks in this experiment: the \r\n[L2875] different diagnoses (asthma, etc.) or the type of care \r\n[L2876] (nurse or doctor)?

Comparing cancer treatments The progress of a \r\n[L2881] type of cancer differs in women and men. Researchers \r\n[L2882] want to design an experiment to compare three thera\ufffepies for this cancer.

In the cornfield An agriculture researcher wants to \r\n[L2895] compare the yield of 5 corn varieties: A, B, C, D, and \r\n[L2896] E. The field in which the experiment will be carried \r\n[L2897] out increases in fertility from north to south. The \r\n[L2898] researcher therefore divides the field into 25 plots \r\n[L2899] of equal size, arranged in 5 east\u2013west rows of 5 plots \r\n[L2900] each, as shown in the diagram.\r\n[L2901] North\r\n[L2902] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2903] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2904] setting.\r\n[L2905] (b) Should the researcher use the rows or the \r\n[L2906] columns of the field as blocks?

Comparing weight-loss treatments Twenty over\ufffeweight females have agreed to participate in a study \r\n[L2911] of the effectiveness of four weight-loss treatments: \r\n[L2912] A, B, C, and D. The researcher first calculates how \r\n[L2913] overweight each subject is by comparing the subject\u2019s \r\n[L2914] actual weight with her \u201cideal\u201d weight. The subjects \r\n[L2915] and their excess weights in pounds are as follows:\r\n[L2916] Birnbaum 35 Hernandez 25 Moses 25 Smith 29\r\n[L2917] Brown 34 Jackson 33 Nevesky 39 Stall 33\r\n[L2918] Brunk 30 Kendall 28 Obrach 30 Tran 35\r\n[L2919] Cruz 34 Loren 32 Rodriguez 30 Wilansky 42\r\n[L2920] Deng 24 Mann 28 Santiago 27 Williams 22\r\n[L2921] The response variable is the weight lost after 8 weeks of \r\n[L2922] treatment. Previous studies have shown that the effects \r\n[L2923] of a diet may vary based on a subject\u2019s initial weight.\r\n[L2924] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2925] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2926] setting.\r\n[L2927] (b) Should researchers form blocks of size 4 based on \r\n[L2928] subjects\u2019 last names in alphabetical order or by how \r\n[L2929] overweight the subjects are? Explain.\r\n[L2930] (c) Use technology or Table D to carry out the \r\n[L2931] random assignment required by your design. Explain \r\n[L2932] your method clearly.\r\n[L2933] 81. Aw, rats! A nutrition experimenter intends to \r\n[L2934] compare the weight gain of newly weaned male \r\n[L2935] rats fed Diet A with that of rats fed Diet B. To do this, \r\n[L2936] she will feed each diet to 10 rats. She has available \r\n[L2937] 10 rats from one litter and 10 rats from a second \r\n[L2938] litter. Rats in the first litter appear to be slightly \r\n[L2939] healthier.\r\n[L2940] (a) If the 10 rats from Litter 1 were fed Diet A, the \r\n[L2941] effects of genetics and diet would be confounded, and \r\n[L2942] the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A. \r\n[L2943] Explain this statement carefully.\r\n[L2944] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2945] 82. Technology for teaching statistics The Brigham \r\n[L2946] Young University (BYU) statistics department is \r\n[L2947] performing experiments to compare teaching meth\ufffeods. Response variables include students\u2019 final-exam \r\n[L2948] scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. \r\n[L2949] One study compares two levels of technology for large \r\n[L2950] lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) \r\n[L2951] and multimedia. There are 8 lecture sections of a \r\n[L2952] basic statistics course at BYU, each with about 200 \r\n[L2953] students. There are four instructors, each of whom \r\n[L2954] teaches two sections.44 Suppose the sections and \r\n[L2955] lecturers are as follows:\r\n[L2956] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2957] 1 Hilton\r\n[L2958] 2 Christensen\r\n[L2959] 3 Hadfield\r\n[L2960] 4 Hadfield\r\n[L2961] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2962] 5 Tolley\r\n[L2963] 6 Hilton\r\n[L2964] 7 Tolley\r\n[L2965] 8 Christensen\r\n[L2966] (a) Suppose we randomly assign two lecturers to use \r\n[L2967] standard technology in their sections and the other \r\n[L2968] two lecturers to use multimedia technology.

Chocolate gets my heart pumping Cardiologists \r\n[L3000] at Athens Medical School in Greece wanted to test \r\n[L3001] whether chocolate affected blood flow in the blood \r\n[L3002] vessels. The researchers recruited 17 healthy young \r\n[L3003] volunteers, who were each given a 3.5-ounce bar of \r\n[L3004] dark chocolate, either bittersweet or fake chocolate. \r\n[L3005] On another day, the volunteers were switched. The \r\n[L3006] subjects had no chocolate outside the study, and \r\n[L3007] investigators didn\u2019t know whether a subject had eaten \r\n[L3008] the real or the fake chocolate. An ultrasound was \r\n[L3009] taken of each volunteer\u2019s upper arm to see the func\ufffetioning of the cells in the walls of the main artery. \r\n[L3010] The investigators found that blood vessel function was \r\n[L3011] improved when the subjects ate bittersweet chocolate, \r\n[L3012] and that there were no such changes when they ate \r\n[L3013] the placebo (fake chocolate).45\r\n[L3014] (a) What type of design did the investigators use in \r\n[L3015] their study?\r\n[L3016] (b) Explain why the investigators chose this design \r\n[L3017] instead of a completely randomized design.\r\n[L3018] (c) Why is it important to randomly assign the order \r\n[L3019] of the treatments for the subjects?\r\n[L3020] 85. Room temperature and dexterity An expert on \r\n[L3021] worker performance is interested in the effect of \r\n[L3022] room temperature on the performance of tasks \r\n[L3023] requiring manual dexterity. She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\n[L3024] variable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\n[L3025] a 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\n[L3026] requires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\n[L3027] subject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\n[L3028] make as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\n[L3029] continuous effort.\r\n[L3030] (a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\n[L3031] compare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\n[L3032] available.\r\n[L3033] (b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\n[L3034] wide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\n[L3035] subjects in each group. Describe in detail the design \r\n[L3036] of a matched pairs experiment in which each subject \r\n[L3037] serves as his or her own control.\r\n[L3038] 86. Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\n[L3039] of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\n[L3040] increasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\n[L3041] Because plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\n[L3042] CO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\n[L3043] An elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\n[L3044] CO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\n[L3045] the growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\n[L3046] untreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\n[L3047] growth. We can afford to treat three circular areas.46\r\n[L3048] (a) Describe the design of a completely randomized \r\n[L3049] experiment using 6 well-separated 30-meter circular \r\n[L3050] areas in a pine forest. Sketch the circles and carry out \r\n[L3051] the randomization your design calls for.\r\n[L3052] (b) Areas within the forest may differ in soil fertility. \r\n[L3053] Describe a matched pairs design using three pairs \r\n[L3054] of circles that will reduce the extra variation due to \r\n[L3055] different fertility. Sketch the circles and carry out the \r\n[L3056] randomization your design calls for.\r\n[L3057] 87. Got deodorant? A group of students wants to per\ufffeform an experiment to determine whether Brand A or \r\n[L3058] Brand B deodorant lasts longer. One group member \r\n[L3059] suggests the following design: Recruit 40 student \r\n[L3060] volunteers\u201420 male and 20 female.

Can changing diet reduce high blood pressure? \r\n[L3098] Vegetarian diets and low-salt diets are both promising. \r\n[L3099] Men with high blood pressure are assigned at random \r\n[L3100] to four diets: (1) normal diet with unrestricted salt; \r\n[L3101] (2) vegetarian with unrestricted salt; (3) normal with \r\n[L3102] restricted salt; and (4) vegetarian with restricted salt. \r\n[L3103] This experiment has\r\n[L3104] (a) one factor, the type of diet.\r\n[L3105] (b) two factors, high blood pressure and type of diet.\r\n[L3106] (c) two factors, normal/vegetarian diet and unre\ufffestricted/restricted salt.\r\n[L3107] (d) three factors, men, high blood pressure, and type \r\n[L3108] of diet.\r\n[L3109] (e) four factors, the four diets being compared.\r\n[L3110] 92.

Is this \r\n[L3152] good evidence that ibuprofen is effective in prevent\ufffeing Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\r\n[L3153] (a) Yes, because the study was a randomized, \r\n[L3154] comparative experiment.\r\n[L3155] (b) No, because the effect of ibuprofen is confounded \r\n[L3156] with the placebo effect.\r\n[L3157] (c) Yes, because the results were published in a \r\n[L3158] reputable professional journal.\r\n[L3159] (d) No, because this is an observational study.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L3219] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L3220] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L3221] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L3222] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L3223] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L3224] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3225] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L3226] on the design of the study.\r\n[L3227] Scope of Inference\r\n[L3228] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L3229] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L3230] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L3231] results of the sample.\r\n[L3232] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L3233] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L3234] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L3235] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L3236] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L3237] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L3238] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L3239] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L3240] 4.3\r\n[L3241] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","[L3242] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3243] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","[L3244] 262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3245] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L3246] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L3247] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L3248] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L3249] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L3250] Yes No\r\n[L3251] Were individuals \r\n[L3252] randomly selected?\r\n[L3253] Yes\r\n[L3254] Inference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\n[L3255] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3256] No Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\n[L3257] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3258] Well-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\n[L3259] However, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\n[L3260] larger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\n[L3261] effect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\n[L3262] rules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\n[L3263] random sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\n[L3264] example illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\n[L3265] EXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\n[L3266] Determining scope of inference\r\n[L3267] A small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\n[L3268] The dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\n[L3269] Design 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3270] to take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L3271] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L3272] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L3273] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L3274] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3275] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L3276] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3277] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3278] part in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3279] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3280] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L3281] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3282] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L3283] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L3284] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L3285] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L3286] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L3287] SOLUTION:\r\n[L3288] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L3289] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments ","[L3290] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a9a2c4c5c24a51b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_57.jpg","size_bytes":59616,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3291] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>","[L3292] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L3293] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3294] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L3295] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L3296] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L3297] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L3298] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L3299] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L3300] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L3301] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L3302] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L3303] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L3304] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L3305] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L3306] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L3307] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L3308] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L3309] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L3310] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L3311] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L3312] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L3313] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L3314] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L3315] the town.\r\n[L3316] The Challenges of \r\n[L3317] Establishing Causation\r\n[L3318] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L3319] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L3320] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L3321] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L3322] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L3323] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L3324] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\n[L3325] Lack of realism\r\n[L3326] Do those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3327] since 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\n[L3328] showed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\n[L3329] But requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\n[L3330] What happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\n[L3331] all cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\n[L3332] For Practice Try Exercise 105","[L3333] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3334] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","[L3335] 264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3336] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3337] In some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\n[L3338] these important questions:\r\n[L3339] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L3340] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L3341] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L3342] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L3343] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L3344] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L3345] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L3346] studies.\r\n[L3347] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L3348] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L3349] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L3350] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L3351] Living with observational studies\r\n[L3352] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L3353] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L3354] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L3355] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L3356] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L3357] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L3358] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L3359] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L3360] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L3361] experiment?\r\n[L3362] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L3363] very strong.\r\n[L3364] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L3365] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L3366] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L3367] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L3368] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L3369] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L3370] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L3371] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L3372] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L3373] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L3374] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L3375] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L3376] cancer death among women.","[L3377] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3378] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","[L3379] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L3380] sThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\n[L3381] cigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\n[L3382] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L3383] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3384] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L3385] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L3386] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L3387] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\n[L3388] observational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\n[L3389] Data Ethics*\r\n[L3390] Medical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\n[L3391] Shouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\n[L3392] reasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L3393] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L3394] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L3395] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L3396] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L3397] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L3398] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L3399] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L3400] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L3401] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L3402] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L3403] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\n[L3404] knows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\n[L3405] the physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\n[L3406] sWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L3407] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L3408] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L3409] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L3410] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L3411] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\n[L3412] are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\n[L3413] data from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\n[L3414] Basic Data Ethics\r\n[L3415] All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\n[L3416] board charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\n[L3417] All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\n[L3418] before data are collected.\r\n[L3419] All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\n[L3420] groups of subjects may be made public.\r\n[L3421] *This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","[L3422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","[L3423] 266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3424] The law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\n[L3425] obey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\n[L3426] Institutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\n[L3427] to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\n[L3428] it is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\n[L3429] board, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\n[L3430] recruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\n[L3431] study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\n[L3432] are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\n[L3433] research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\n[L3434] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L3435] boards.\r\n[L3436] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L3437] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L3438] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L3439] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L3440] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L3441] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L3442] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L3443] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L3444] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L3445] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L3446] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L3447] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L3448] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L3449] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L3450] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity. Anonym\ufffeity means that individuals are anonymous\u2014their names ","[L3451] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 63 / 75>","[L3452] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 267\r\n[L3453] are not known even to the director of the study. Anonymity is rare in statistical stud\ufffeies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it \r\n[L3454] prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform individuals of results.\r\n[L3455] Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L3456] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L3457] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L3458] other identification have been removed from the data available for search. Privacy \r\n[L3459] and confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the computer age.\r\n[L3460] ACTIVITY Response bias\r\n[L3461] In this Activity, your team will design and conduct an experiment to investigate \r\n[L3462] the effects of response bias in surveys.53 You may choose the topic for your sur\ufffeveys, but you must design your experiment so that it can answer at least one of the \r\n[L3463] following questions:\r\n[L3464] sCan the wording of a question create response bias?\r\n[L3465] sDo the characteristics of the interviewer create response bias?\r\n[L3466] sDoes anonymity change the responses to sensitive questions?\r\n[L3467] sDoes manipulating the answer choices change the response?\r\n[L3468] 1. Write a proposal describing the design of your experiment. Be sure to \r\n[L3469] include\r\n[L3470] (a) your chosen topic and which of the above questions you\u2019ll try to answer.\r\n[L3471] (b) a detailed description of how you will obtain your subjects (minimum of \r\n[L3472] 50). Your plan must be practical!\r\n[L3473] (c) what your questions will be and how they will be asked.\r\n[L3474] (d) a clear explanation of how you will implement your design.\r\n[L3475] (e) precautions you will take to collect data ethically.\r\n[L3476] Here are two examples of successful student projects:\r\n[L3477] \u201cMake-Up,\u201d by Caryn S. and Trisha T.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L3496] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L3497] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L3498] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L3499] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L3500] results.\r\n[L3501] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L3502] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L3503] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L3504] lurking variables.\r\n[L3505] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L3506] review board. All participants must give their informed consent before \r\n[L3507] taking part. Any information about the individuals in the study must be \r\n[L3508] kept confidential.\r\n[L3509] s Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions \r\n[L3510] that can\u2019t be answered without them. Also remember that \u201cthe interests of \r\n[L3511] the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\u201d54\r\n[L3512] Summary SECTION 4.3\r\n[L3513] Magnets and Pain\r\n[L3514] Let\u2019s return to the chapter-opening Case Study (page 205). Researchers carried \r\n[L3515] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L3516] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\n[L3517] dotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\n[L3518] magnet).\r\n[L3519] The average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\n[L3520] and 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\n[L3521] significant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\n[L3522] The difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\n[L3523] too large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain. But since the subjects were volunteers, we can\u2019t \r\n[L3524] safely generalize the findings of this experiment to any larger \r\n[L3525] population.\r\n[L3526] case closed","[L3527] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 65 / 75>","[L3528] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 269\r\n[L3529] 102.

Foster care versus orphanages Do abandoned \r\n[L3534] children placed in foster homes do better than \r\n[L3535] similar children placed in an institution? The \r\n[L3536] Bucharest Early Intervention Project found that \r\n[L3537] the answer is a clear \u201cYes.\u201d The subjects were 136 \r\n[L3538] young children abandoned at birth and living in \r\n[L3539] orphanages in Bucharest, Romania. Half of the \r\n[L3540] children, chosen at random, were placed in foster \r\n[L3541] homes. The other half remained in the orphanages.55\r\n[L3542] (Foster care was not easily available in Romania at \r\n[L3543] the time and so was paid for by the study.)

At the end of that time \r\n[L3552] period, each battery\u2019s charge is tested. Result:\r\n[L3553] Batteries stored in the freezer had a higher average \r\n[L3554] charge, and the difference between the groups was \r\n[L3555] statistically significant.

According to \r\n[L3558] Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain,\r\n[L3559] women say nearly three times as many words per day \r\n[L3560] as men. Skeptical researchers devised a study to test \r\n[L3561] this claim. They used electronic devices to record \r\n[L3562] the talking patterns of 396 university students who \r\n[L3563] volunteered to participate in the study. The device \r\n[L3564] was programmed to record 30 seconds of sound \r\n[L3565] every 12.5 minutes without the carrier\u2019s knowledge. \r\n[L3566] According to a published report of the study in \r\n[L3567] Scientific American, \u201cMen showed a slightly wider \r\n[L3568] variability in words uttered.... But in the end, the \r\n[L3569] sexes came out just about even in the daily averages: \r\n[L3570] women at 16,215 words and men at 15,669.\u201d56 This \r\n[L3571] difference was not statistically significant.

One of the better \r\n[L3574] studies of the effect of regular attendance at religious \r\n[L3575] services gathered data from a random sample of \r\n[L3576] 3617 adults. The researchers then measured lots of \r\n[L3577] variables, not just the explanatory variable (religious \r\n[L3578] activities) and the response variable (length of life). \r\n[L3579] A news article said: \u201cChurchgoers were more likely \r\n[L3580] to be nonsmokers, physically active, and at their \r\n[L3581] right weight. But even after health behaviors were \r\n[L3582] taken into account, those not attending religious \r\n[L3583] services regularly still were about 25% more likely to \r\n[L3584] have died.\u201d57 What conclusion can we draw from \r\n[L3585] this study? Explain.\r\n[L3586] 107. Daytime running lights Canada requires that cars \r\n[L3587] be equipped with \u201cdaytime running lights,\u201d \r\n[L3588] headlights that automatically come on at a low \r\n[L3589] level when the car is started. Some manufacturers \r\n[L3590] are now equipping cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3591] with running lights. Will running lights reduce \r\n[L3592] accidents by making cars more visible?

Studying frustration A psychologist wants to study \r\n[L3598] the effects of failure and frustration on the \r\n[L3599] relationships among members of a work team. \r\n[L3600] She forms a team of students, brings them to the \r\n[L3601] psychology lab, and has them play a game that \r\n[L3602] requires teamwork. The game is rigged so that they \r\n[L3603] lose regularly. The psychologist observes the students \r\n[L3604] through a one-way window and notes the changes in \r\n[L3605] their behavior during an evening of game playing. \r\n[L3606] Can the psychologist generalize the results of her \r\n[L3607] study to a team of employees that spends months \r\n[L3608] developing a new product that never works right and \r\n[L3609] is finally abandoned by their company?

The researchers \r\n[L3684] argued that almost all children in the institution \r\n[L3685] quickly became infected anyway. The studies \r\n[L3686] showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis \r\n[L3687] existed. This finding contributed to the development \r\n[L3688] of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, \r\n[L3689] the Willowbrook studies are now considered an \r\n[L3690] example of unethical research. Explain why, \r\n[L3691] according to current ethical standards, useful results \r\n[L3692] are not enough to allow a study.\r\n[L3693] 116.* Unequal benefits Researchers on aging proposed to \r\n[L3694] investigate the effect of supplemental health services \r\n[L3695] on the quality of life of older people. Eligible \r\n[L3696] patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to \r\n[L3697] be randomly assigned to treatment and control \r\n[L3698] groups.

Potatoes are kept refrigerated before being \r\n[L3852] cut for french fries to prevent spoiling and preserve flavor. \r\n[L3853] But immediate processing of cold potatoes causes discol\ufffeoring due to complex chemical reactions. The potatoes \r\n[L3854] must therefore be brought to room temperature before \r\n[L3855] processing. Researchers want to design an experiment in \r\n[L3856] which tasters will rate the color and flavor of french fries \r\n[L3857] prepared from several groups of potatoes. The potatoes \r\n[L3858] will be freshly picked or stored for a month at room tem\ufffeperature or stored for a month refrigerated.

In all, 1347 of the teachers return \r\n[L4085] the survey. Of those who responded, 32% say that they favor \r\n[L4086] some kind of national proficiency test. Which of the follow\ufffeing statements about this situation is true?\r\n[L4087] (a) Since random sampling was used, we can feel confi\ufffedent that the percent of all American high school teachers \r\n[L4088] who would say they favor a national proficiency test is close \r\n[L4089] to 32%.\r\n[L4090] (b) We cannot trust these results, because the survey was \r\n[L4091] mailed. Only survey results from face-to-face interviews are \r\n[L4092] considered valid.\r\n[L4093] (c) Because over half of those who were mailed the survey \r\n[L4094] actually responded, we can feel pretty confident that the ac\ufffetual percent of all American high school teachers who would \r\n[L4095] say they favor a national proficiency test is close to 32%.\r\n[L4096] (d) The results of this survey may be affected by nonre\ufffesponse bias.\r\n[L4097] (e) The results of this survey cannot be trusted due to vol\ufffeuntary response bias.\r\n[L4098] Section II: Free Response Show all your work.

Many people start their day with a jolt of caffeine \r\n[L4140] from coffee or a soft drink. Most experts agree that people \r\n[L4141] who take in large amounts of caffeine each day may suf\ufffefer from physical withdrawal symptoms if they stop ingest\ufffeing their usual amounts of caffeine. Researchers recruited \r\n[L4142] 11 volunteers who were caffeine dependent and who were \r\n[L4143] willing to take part in a caffeine withdrawal experiment. \r\n[L4144] The experiment was conducted on two 2-day periods that \r\n[L4145] occurred one week apart. During one of the 2-day periods, \r\n[L4146] each subject was given a capsule containing the amount \r\n[L4147] of caffeine normally ingested by that subject in one day. \r\n[L4148] During the other study period, the subjects were given pla\ufffecebos.

Those who advocate for monetary incentives in \r\n[L4403] a work environment claim that this type of incentive has \r\n[L4404] the greatest appeal because it allows the winners to do what \r\n[L4405] they want with their winnings.

Not only are there national brands for \r\n[L4428] most products, but many stores have their own in-house \r\n[L4429] brands. Since shelf space is not infinite, the question is \r\n[L4430] how many linear feet to allocate to each product and \r\n[L4431] which shelf (top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle) \r\n[L4432] to put it on. The middle shelf is the most popular and lu\ufffecrative, since many shoppers, if undecided, will simply \r\n[L4433] pick the product that is at eye level. \r\n[L4434] A local store that sells many upscale goods is trying to \r\n[L4435] determine how much shelf space to allocate to its own \r\n[L4436] brand of men\u2019s personal-grooming products.

By the end of the chapter, you\u2019ll be ready to interpret \r\n[L7] the results of this study.\r\n[L8] Early research showed that magnetic fields affected living tissue in humans. Some doc\ufffetors have begun to use magnets to treat patients with chronic pain. Scientists wondered \r\n[L9] whether this type of therapy really worked. They designed a study to find out.\r\n[L10] Fifty patients with chronic pain were recruited for the study. A doctor identified a painful \r\n[L11] site on each patient and asked him or her to rate the pain on a scale from 0 (mild pain) to \r\n[L12] 10 (severe pain). Then, the doctor selected a sealed envelope containing a magnet from a \r\n[L13] box that contained both active and inactive magnets. That way, neither the doctor nor the \r\n[L14] patient knew which type of magnet was being used. The chosen magnet was applied to \r\n[L15] the site of the pain for 45 minutes. After \u201ctreatment,\u201d each patient was again asked to rate \r\n[L16] the level of pain from 0 to 10.\r\n[L17] In all, 29 patients were given active magnets and 21 patients received inactive magnets. \r\n[L18] All but one of the patients rated their initial pain as an 8, 9, or 10.

Here are \r\n[L26] some examples:\r\n[L27] sThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\n[L28] seat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\n[L29] sAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\n[L30] an average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\n[L31] teens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\n[L32] unsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\n[L33] sA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\n[L34] of catching a cold.4\r\n[L35] sFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\n[L36] that listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\n[L37] Can we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\n[L38] depends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\n[L39] look at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\n[L40] Each year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\n[L41] vehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\n[L42] people in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\n[L43] of an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\n[L44] asking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\n[L45] conducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\n[L46] about some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\n[L47] In the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\n[L48] questions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\n[L49] them a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\n[L50] observational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\n[L51] drawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\n[L52] while listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\n[L53] list of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\n[L54] The goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\n[L55] changes in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\n[L56] the ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\n[L57] Here\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\n[L58] ACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\n[L59] MATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\n[L60] clock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\n[L61] Confucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget.

To answer the question, we will interview 16- to 20-year-olds \r\n[L70] who live in the United States and drive. Ideally, we would ask them all (take a \r\n[L71] census). But contacting every driver in this age group wouldn\u2019t be practical: it \r\n[L72] would take too much time and cost too much money. Instead, we put the question \r\n[L73] to a sample chosen to represent the entire population of young drivers.\r\n[L74] 4.1\r\n[L75] In Section 4.1, \r\n[L76] you\u2019ll learn about: \r\n[L77] sThe idea of a sample \r\n[L78] survey\r\n[L79] sHow to sample badly\r\n[L80] sHow to sample well: \r\n[L81] Random sampling\r\n[L82] sOther sampling methods\r\n[L83] sInference for sampling\r\n[L84] sSample surveys: What \r\n[L85] can go wrong?\r\n[L86] 1.

Do not look at the numbers until it is time for you to do the \r\n[L89] experiment.\r\n[L90] 3. Flip a coin to decide which of you is Student A and which is Student B. \r\n[L91] Shuffle the index cards and deal one face down to each partner.\r\n[L92] 4. Student A will attempt a memory task while Student B keeps time.\r\n[L93] Directions: Study the pairs of numbers on the index card for 30 seconds. Then \r\n[L94] turn the card over. Recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.). Then tell your part\ufffener (Student B) what you think the numbers on the card are. Student B will \r\n[L95] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L96] 5. Now it\u2019s Student B\u2019s turn to do a memory task while Student A records the data.\r\n[L97] Directions: Your partner will read the pairs of numbers on your index card aloud \r\n[L98] three times slowly. Next, you will recite the alphabet aloud (A, B, C, etc.) and \r\n[L99] then tell your partner what you think the numbers on the card are. Student A will \r\n[L100] record how many pairs of numbers you recalled correctly.\r\n[L101] 6. Your teacher will scale and label axes on the board for parallel dotplots of the re\ufffesults. Plot the number of pairs you remembered correctly on the appropriate graph.\r\n[L102] 7. Did students in your class remember numbers better when they saw them or \r\n[L103] when they heard them? Give appropriate evidence to support your answer.\r\n[L104] 8. Based on the results of this experiment, can we conclude that people in gen\ufffeeral remember better when they see than when they hear? Why or why not?\r\n[L105] DEFINITION: Population and sample\r\n[L106] The population in a statistical study is the entire group of individuals about which we \r\n[L107] want information.\r\n[L108] A sample is the part of the population from which we actually collect information. We \r\n[L109] use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\n[L110] The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\n[L111] sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\n[L112] Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\n[L113] uses of sampling.","[L114] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L115] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","[L116] 208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L117] EXAMPLE\r\n[L118] EXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\n[L119] Populations and samples\r\n[L120] PROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n[L121] (a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\n[L122] before shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\n[L123] five pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\n[L124] moisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n[L125] (b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\n[L126] SOLUTION:\r\n[L127] (a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\n[L128] that are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n[L129] (b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\n[L130] For Practice Try Exercise 1\r\n[L131] The Idea of a Sample Survey\r\n[L132] We often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\n[L133] basis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\n[L134] and ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\n[L135] cream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\n[L136] whole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\n[L137] varied population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\n[L138] The first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\n[L139] what population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\n[L140] exactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\n[L141] We reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\n[L142] example. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\n[L143] or \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\n[L144] or more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example. We\u2019ll avoid this more \r\n[L145] restrictive terminology.\r\n[L146] Sample survey\r\n[L147] How Does the Current Population Survey Work?\r\n[L148] A sample survey\r\n[L149] One of the most important government sample surveys in the United States is \r\n[L150] the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS).

A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\n[L164] easiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\n[L165] produce unrepresentative data.\r\n[L166] other economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\n[L167] specify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\n[L168] all U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\n[L169] not in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\n[L170] news refers to this specific population.\r\n[L171] What does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\n[L172] for example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\n[L173] she is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\n[L174] first asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\n[L175] work in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\n[L176] you are not in the labor force.\r\n[L177] If you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\n[L178] you did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\n[L179] you are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\n[L180] pay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\n[L181] because of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason. An unemployment rate \r\n[L182] of 9.7% means that 9.7% of the sample was unemployed, using the exact CPS \r\n[L183] definitions of both \u201clabor force\u201d and \u201cunemployed.\u201d\r\n[L184] DEFINITION: Convenience sample\r\n[L185] Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach results in a convenience sample.\r\n[L186] What\u2019s wrong with our convenience sample of students in the library? It\u2019s \r\n[L187] unlikely that this sample represents the homework habits of all students at the \r\n[L188] school well. In fact, we\u2019d expect the sample to overestimate the average homework \r\n[L189] time in the population since students who hang out in the library might tend to \r\n[L190] be more studious. This is bias: using a method that will consistently overestimate \r\n[L191] or underestimate the value you want to know.","[L192] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bea60ae105051c9#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_4.jpg","size_bytes":53957,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L193] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>","[L194] 210 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L195] EXAMPLE\r\n[L196] DEFINITION: Bias\r\n[L197] The design of a statistical study shows bias if it systematically favors certain outcomes.\r\n[L198] Convenience samples are almost guaranteed to show bias. So are voluntary \r\n[L199] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L200] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L201] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L202] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L203] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L204] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L205] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L206] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L207] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L208] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L209] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L210] to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That\u2019s not a representative sam\ufffeple of the population as a whole.\r\n[L211] Illegal Immigrants and Driver\u2019s Licenses\r\n[L212] Online polls\r\n[L213] Former CNN commentator Lou Dobbs doesn\u2019t like illegal immigration. One \r\n[L214] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L215] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L216] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L217] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L218] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L219] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L220] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L221] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L222] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L223] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L224] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L225] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L226] the direction of the bias.

In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L247] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L248] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L249] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L250] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L251] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L252] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L253] random sample.\r\n[L254] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L255] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L256] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L257] sample actually selected.\r\n[L258] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L259] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L260] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L261] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L262] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L263] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L264] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L265] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L266] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L267] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L268] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L269] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L270] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L271] if the population is large. Think about the \r\n[L272] Current Population Survey, for example, \r\n[L273] Random sampling","[L274] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 7 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://3a54b1107c99c35#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_6.jpg","size_bytes":57187,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L275] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>","[L276] 212 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L277] which must draw a sample of size 60,000 every month from the population of \r\n[L278] over 117 million U.S. households.\r\n[L279] In practice, people use random numbers generated by a computer or calcula\ufffetor to choose samples. If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L280] random digits.\r\n[L281] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L282] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L283] these properties:\r\n[L284] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L285] s The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\n[L286] gives no information about any other part.\r\n[L287] Table D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\n[L288] digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\n[L289] in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\n[L290] the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\n[L291] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L292] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L293] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L294] same length.\r\n[L295] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L296] from Table D.\r\n[L297] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L298] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L299] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L300] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L301] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L302] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L303] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L304] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L305] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L306] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L307] and so on\u2014because the table has no order. We recommend reading across rows \r\n[L308] from left to right.","[L309] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 8 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://fed072027c0760d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_7.jpg","size_bytes":43027,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L310] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 75>","[L311] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 213\r\n[L312] Spring Break!\r\n[L313] Choosing an SRS with Table D\r\n[L314] The school newspaper is planning an article on family-friendly \r\n[L315] places to stay over spring break at a nearby beach town.

The applet sampled without replacement from the \u201cPopulation hop\ufffeper,\u201d but the calculator sampled with replacement from the specified population. \r\n[L397] As a result, the calculator sometimes selects the same number more than once in \r\n[L398] a given sample. To deal with this problem, you can generate additional random \r\n[L399] numbers as needed to replace any repeats. Or you can use a method other than \r\n[L400] randInt (like randSamp on the TI-Nspire) to sample without replacement. Refer \r\n[L401] to your device\u2019s reference manual or ask your teacher.\r\n[L402] We can trust results from an SRS, as well as from other types of random samples \r\n[L403] that we will meet later, because the use of impersonal chance avoids bias. Online\r\n[L404] and call-in polls also produce samples. But we can\u2019t trust results from these sam\ufffeples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. The first question to ask about \r\n[L405] any sample is whether it was chosen at random.\r\n[L406] Other Sampling Methods\r\n[L407] The basic idea of sampling is straightforward: take an SRS from the population \r\n[L408] and use your sample results to gain information about the population. Unfor\ufffetunately, it\u2019s usually very difficult to actually get an SRS from the population of \r\n[L409] interest. Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L410] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L411] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L412] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L413] selected.

Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L420] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L421] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L422] between strata.\r\n[L423] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L424] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L425] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L426] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L427] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L428] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L429] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L430] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L431] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size.

Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L435] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L436] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L437] money she\u2019ll make from selling them. It would take too much time to \r\n[L438] count the plants in all 100 squares, so she\u2019ll accept an estimate based on \r\n[L439] a sample of 10 squares.\r\n[L440] 1. Use Table D or technology to take a simple random sample of 10 \r\n[L441] grid squares. Record the location (for example, B6) of each square you \r\n[L442] select.\r\n[L443] 2. This time, you\u2019ll take a stratified random sample using the \r\n[L444] rows as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select \r\n[L445] one square from each (horizontal) row. Record the location of \r\n[L446] each square.\r\n[L447] 3. Now, take a stratified random sample using the columns\r\n[L448] as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select one \r\n[L449] square from each (vertical) column. Record the location of \r\n[L450] each square.\r\n[L451] 4. The table on page N/DS-6 gives the actual number of \r\n[L452] sunflowers in each grid square. Use the information provided \r\n[L453] to calculate your estimate of the mean number of sunflowers \r\n[L454] per square for each of your samples in Steps 1, 2, and 3. 10\r\n[L455] 9\r\n[L456] 8\r\n[L457] 7\r\n[L458] 6\r\n[L459] 5\r\n[L460] 4\r\n[L461] 3\r\n[L462] 2\r\n[L463] 1\r\n[L464] ABCDE FGH I J","[L465] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://4ec2fd9c327650e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60115,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L466] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 75>","[L467] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 217\r\n[L468] EXAMPLE\r\n[L469] 5.

How did the three sampling methods do?\r\n[L472] The following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\n[L473] in the music business.\r\n[L474] Who Wrote That Song?\r\n[L475] Using a stratified random sample\r\n[L476] A radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\n[L477] The organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\n[L478] members by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\n[L479] ASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\n[L480] year. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L481] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L482] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L483] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L484] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L485] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L486] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L487] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L488] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L489] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L490] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L491] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L492] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L493] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups. Ideally, these \r\n[L494] clusters should mirror the characteristics of the population. Then choose an SRS of the \r\n[L495] clusters. All individuals in the chosen clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L496] Imagine a large high school that assigns its students to homerooms alphabeti\ufffecally by last name.

They don\u2019t offer the statistical advantage of better information about the \r\n[L507] population that stratified random samples do. That\u2019s because clusters are often \r\n[L508] chosen for ease or convenience, so they may have as much variability as the popu\ufffelation itself. Be sure you understand the difference between strata and clusters. \r\n[L509] We want each stratum to contain similar individuals, and for there to be large \r\n[L510] differences between strata. For a cluster sample, we\u2019d like each cluster to look just \r\n[L511] like the population, but on a smaller scale.\r\n[L512] Sampling at a School Assembly\r\n[L513] Strata or clusters?\r\n[L514] The student council wants to conduct a survey during the first \r\n[L515] five minutes of an all-school assembly in the auditorium about \r\n[L516] use of the school library. They would like to announce the \r\n[L517] results of the survey at the end of the assembly.

Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L619] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L620] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L621] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L622] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L623] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L624] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L625] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L626] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L627] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L628] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L629] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L630] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L631] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L632] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L633] Sampling Units, or PSUs. Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\n[L634] the 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\n[L635] of the others.\r\n[L636] Stage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\n[L637] Stratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\n[L638] Stage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\n[L639] units. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\n[L640] Analyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\n[L641] beyond basic statistics. But the SRS is the building block of more elaborate \r\n[L642] methods, and the principles of analysis remain much the same for these other \r\n[L643] methods.\r\n[L644] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L645] The manager of a sports arena wants to learn more about the financial status of the people \r\n[L646] who are attending an NBA basketball game.

The \r\n[L666] process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\n[L667] called inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\n[L668] we know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\n[L669] response samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\n[L670] the population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\n[L671] selecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\n[L672] Still, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\n[L673] the entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\n[L674] the monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\n[L675] population. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\n[L676] almost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\n[L677] Inference\r\n[L678] ACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\n[L679] MATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\n[L680] other container that students can\u2019t see through\r\n[L681] In this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\n[L682] in relation to the population truth.\r\n[L683] 1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\n[L684] particular color.\r\n[L685] 2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\n[L686] record the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\n[L687] returned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n[L688] 3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\n[L689] is the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\n[L690] center? Is there a clear shape?\r\n[L691] Why can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\n[L692] results of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\n[L693] Because we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\n[L694] govern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\n[L695] results are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\n[L696] random sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\n[L697] the population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\n[L698] sets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\n[L699] for sampling later.\r\n[L700] One point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples. For instance, in the Activity, \r\n[L701] you would get a better estimate of the proportion of red chips in the popula\ufffeMargin of error","[L702] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 16 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://136106c58c36cbc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_15.jpg","size_bytes":54135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L703] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>","[L704] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 221\r\n[L705] tion using random samples of 40 chips than 20 chips. By taking a very large \r\n[L706] sample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\n[L707] about the population.\r\n[L708] The Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\n[L709] expect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\n[L710] of the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n[L711] 3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\n[L712] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L713] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L714] clicked a response.\r\n[L715] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L716] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L717] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L718] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L719] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L720] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L721] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L722] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L723] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L724] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L725] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L726] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L727] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L728] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L729] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L730] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L731] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L732] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L733] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L734] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L735] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L736] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L737] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L738] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L739] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L740] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L741] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L742] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L743] Sampling frame","[L744] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L745] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","[L746] 222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L747] EXAMPLE\r\n[L748] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L749] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L750] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L751] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L752] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L753] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L754] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L755] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L756] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L757] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L758] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L759] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L760] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L761] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L762] refuses to participate.\r\n[L763] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L764] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L765] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L766] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L767] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L768] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L769] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L770] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L771] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L772] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L773] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L774] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L775] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L776] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L777] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L778] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L779] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","[L780] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L781] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","[L782] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L783] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L784] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L785] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L786] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L787] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L788] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L789] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L790] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L791] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L792] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L793] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L794] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L795] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L796] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L797] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L798] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L799] memory. \u201cHave you visited a dentist in the last 6 months?\u201d will often draw a \r\n[L800] \u201cYes\u201d from someone who last visited a dentist 8 months ago.10 Careful training \r\n[L801] of interviewers and careful supervision to avoid variation among the interview\ufffeers can reduce response bias.

Confusing or leading questions can introduce strong bias, and \r\n[L809] changes in wording can greatly change a survey\u2019s outcome. Even the order in \r\n[L810] which questions are asked matters.\r\n[L811] How Do Americans Feel about Illegal Immigrants?\r\n[L812] Question wording matters\r\n[L813] \u201cShould illegal immigrants be prosecuted and deported for being in the U.S. illegally, \r\n[L814] or shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Asked this question in an opinion poll, 69% favored deportation. \r\n[L815] But when the very same sample was asked whether illegal immigrants who have \r\n[L816] worked in the United States for two years \u201cshould be given a chance to keep their jobs \r\n[L817] and eventually apply for legal status,\u201d 62% said that they should. Different questions \r\n[L818] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L819] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L820] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L821] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L822] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L823] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L824] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L825] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L826] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L827] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L828] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L829] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L830] 1. Each of the following is a source of error in a sample survey. Label each as sampling\r\n[L831] error or nonsampling error, and explain your answers.\r\n[L832] (a) The telephone directory is used as a sampling frame.\r\n[L833] (b) The person cannot be contacted in five calls.\r\n[L834] (c) Interviewers choose people walking by on the sidewalk to interview.\r\n[L835] 2. A survey paid for by makers of disposable diapers found that 84% of the sample opposed \r\n[L836] banning disposable diapers. Here is the actual question:\r\n[L837] It is estimated that disposable diapers account for less than 2% of the trash in today\u2019s \r\n[L838] landfills. In contrast, beverage containers, third-class mail and yard wastes are estimated\r\n[L839] to account for about 21% of the trash in landfills. Given this, in your opinion, would it \r\n[L840] be fair to ban disposable diapers?11\r\n[L841] Explain how the wording of the question could result in bias.

We base conclusions about the \r\n[L852] population on data from the sample. It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L853] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L854] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L855] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L856] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L857] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L858] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L859] process.\r\n[L860] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L861] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L862] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L863] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L864] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L865] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L866] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L867] the way the sample represents the population. Voluntary response samples,\r\n[L868] in which the respondents choose themselves, and convenience samples,\r\n[L869] in which individuals close by are included in the sample, are particularly \r\n[L870] prone to large bias.\r\n[L871] s Sampling errors come from the act of choosing a sample. Random \r\n[L872] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L873] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L874] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L875] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L876] errors. These have nothing to do with choosing a sample\u2014they are \r\n[L877] present even in a census. The single biggest problem for sample surveys \r\n[L878] is nonresponse: people can\u2019t be contacted or refuse to answer. Incorrect \r\n[L879] answers by respondents can lead to response bias.

Student archaeologists An archaeological dig turns \r\n[L895] up large numbers of pottery shards, broken stone \r\n[L896] tools, and other artifacts. Students working on the \r\n[L897] project classify each artifact and assign it a number. \r\n[L898] The counts in different categories are important for \r\n[L899] understanding the site, so the project director chooses \r\n[L900] 2% of the artifacts at random and checks the students\u2019 \r\n[L901] work.

Sampling stuffed envelopes A large retailer prepares \r\n[L903] its customers\u2019 monthly credit card bills using an \r\n[L904] automatic machine that folds the bills, stuffs them \r\n[L905] into envelopes, and seals the envelopes for mailing. \r\n[L906] Are the envelopes completely sealed?

Sleepless nights How much sleep do high school \r\n[L949] students get on a typical school night? An interested \r\n[L950] student designed a survey to find out. To make data \r\n[L951] collection easier, the student surveyed the first 100 \r\n[L952] students to arrive at school on a particular morning. \r\n[L953] These students reported an average of 7.2 hours of \r\n[L954] sleep on the previous night.\r\n[L955] (a) What type of sample did the student obtain?\r\n[L956] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased.

Management would like to ensure \r\n[L1045] that the phones\u2019 display screens meet their quality \r\n[L1046] standards before shipping them to retail stores. Since \r\n[L1047] it takes about 10 minutes to inspect an individual \r\n[L1048] phone\u2019s display screen, managers decide to inspect a \r\n[L1049] sample of 20 phones from the day\u2019s production.\r\n[L1050] (a) Explain why it would be difficult for managers to \r\n[L1051] inspect an SRS of 20 iPhones that are produced today.\r\n[L1052] (b) An eager employee suggests that it would be easy \r\n[L1053] to inspect the last 20 iPhones that were produced \r\n[L1054] today. Why isn\u2019t this a good idea?\r\n[L1055] (c) Another employee recommends inspecting every \r\n[L1056] fiftieth iPhone that is produced.

Why is \r\n[L1067] this sampling method biased?\r\n[L1068] (c) Suppose that a more complicated random sam\ufffepling plan is carried out, and that 35% of the pine trees \r\n[L1069] in the sample are infested by the pine beetle. Can \r\n[L1070] scientists conclude that 35% of all the pine trees on the \r\n[L1071] west side of the park are infested? Why or why not?\r\n[L1072] 19. Who goes to the convention?

It decides to choose those who will \r\n[L1087] go by random selection. How will you label the two \r\n[L1088] strata? Use Table D, beginning at line 123, to choose \r\n[L1089] a stratified random sample of 4 students and 2 faculty \r\n[L1090] members.\r\n[L1091] 20. Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\n[L1092] stratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\n[L1093] records of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\n[L1094] stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\n[L1095] and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\n[L1096] One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\n[L1097] these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\n[L1098] amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000. Using these \r\n[L1099] groups as strata, you decide to verify all the largest \r\n[L1100] accounts and to sample 5% of the midsize accounts \r\n[L1101] and 1% of the small accounts. How would you label \r\n[L1102] the two strata from which you will sample? Use Table \r\n[L1103] D, starting at line 115, to select only the first 3 \r\n[L1104] accounts from each of these strata.\r\n[L1105] 21. Go Blue! Michigan Stadium, also known as \u201cThe Big \r\n[L1106] House,\u201d seats over 100,000 fans for a football game. \r\n[L1107] The University of Michigan athletic department plans \r\n[L1108] to conduct a survey about concessions that are sold \r\n[L1109] during games. Tickets are most expensive for seats \r\n[L1110] near the field and on the sideline. The cheapest seats \r\n[L1111] are high up in the end zones (where one of the au\ufffethors sat as a student).

The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L1153] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L1154] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L1155] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L1156] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L1157] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L1158] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L1159] might be preferable to an SRS in this case. What \r\n[L1160] would you use as strata?\r\n[L1161] (b) Why might a cluster sample be a simpler option? \r\n[L1162] What would you use as clusters?\r\n[L1163] 23. Is it an SRS? A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L1164] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L1165] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L1166] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L1167] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L1168] Explain your answer.\r\n[L1169] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L1170] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L1171] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L1172] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L1173] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L1174] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L1175] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L1176] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L1177] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L1178] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L1179] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L1180] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L1181] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L1182] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L1183] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L1184] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L1185] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L1186] method?\r\n[L1187] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L1188] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L1189] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L1190] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L1191] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L1192] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L1193] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L1194] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1195] sample.\r\n[L1196] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L1197] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L1198] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L1199] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L1200] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L1201] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L1202] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L1203] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L1204] pg 218","[L1205] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1206] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","[L1207] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L1208] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1209] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200. Enter the \r\n[L1210] table at line 120.\r\n[L1211] (b) Like an SRS, a systematic random sample gives \r\n[L1212] all individuals the same chance to be chosen. Explain \r\n[L1213] why this is true. Then explain carefully why a system\ufffeatic sample is not an SRS.\r\n[L1214] 27. Sampling frame Ideally, the sampling frame in a \r\n[L1215] sample survey should list every individual in the \r\n[L1216] population, but in practice, this is often difficult. \r\n[L1217] Suppose that a sample of households in a community \r\n[L1218] is selected at random from the telephone directory. \r\n[L1219] Explain how this sampling method results in under\ufffecoverage that could lead to bias.\r\n[L1220] 28. Sampling frame Refer to the previous exercise. It is \r\n[L1221] more common in telephone surveys to use random \r\n[L1222] digit dialing equipment that selects the last four digits \r\n[L1223] of a telephone number at random after being given \r\n[L1224] the exchange (the first three digits). Explain how this \r\n[L1225] sampling method results in undercoverage that could \r\n[L1226] lead to bias.\r\n[L1227] 29. Baseball tickets Suppose you want to know the \r\n[L1228] average amount of money spent by the fans attending \r\n[L1229] opening day for the Cleveland Indians baseball sea\ufffeson. You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\n[L1230] to conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\n[L1231] allow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\n[L1232] seats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\n[L1233] you randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\n[L1234] stadium. During the game, you ask the fans in those \r\n[L1235] seats how much they spent that day.\r\n[L1236] (a) Provide a reason why this survey might yield a \r\n[L1237] biased result.\r\n[L1238] (b) Explain whether the reason you provided in (a) is \r\n[L1239] a sampling error or a nonsampling error.\r\n[L1240] 30. What kind of error? Which of the following are \r\n[L1241] sources of sampling error and which are sources of \r\n[L1242] nonsampling error? Explain your answers.\r\n[L1243] (a) The subject lies about past drug use.\r\n[L1244] (b) A typing error is made in recording the data.\r\n[L1245] (c) Data are gathered by asking people to mail in a \r\n[L1246] coupon printed in a newspaper.\r\n[L1247] 31. Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\n[L1248] sampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\n[L1249] the United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n[L1250] 5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\n[L1251] estimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n[L1252] (a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n[L1253] (b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\n[L1254] survey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n[L1255] 32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\n[L1256] in telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\n[L1257] call is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\n[L1258] The Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\n[L1259] nonresponse to a government survey of households \r\n[L1260] in Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\n[L1261] July 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\n[L1262] and 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\n[L1263] period versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\n[L1264] period.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\n[L1265] rate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\n[L1266] nonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n[L1267] 33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n[L1268] 31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\n[L1269] answer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\n[L1270] drove through, how many of them were red when you \r\n[L1271] entered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n[L1272] 171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\n[L1273] practical problem with this survey is that people may \r\n[L1274] not give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\n[L1275] of the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n[L1276] 880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n[L1277] 34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\n[L1278] belt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\n[L1279] chosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\n[L1280] they were invited to answer questions that included \r\n[L1281] questions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\n[L1282] always used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\n[L1283] seat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\n[L1284] lots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey. Do you expect bias in the same \r\n[L1285] direction in most surveys about seat belt use?\r\n[L1286] 35. Wording bias Comment on each of the following \r\n[L1287] as a potential sample survey question. Is the question \r\n[L1288] clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1289] (a) \u201cSome cell phone users have developed brain \r\n[L1290] cancer. Should all cell phones come with a warning \r\n[L1291] label explaining the danger of using cell phones?\u201d\r\n[L1292] (b) \u201cDo you agree that a national system of health \r\n[L1293] insurance should be favored because it would provide \r\n[L1294] health insurance for everyone and would reduce \r\n[L1295] administrative costs?\u201d\r\n[L1296] (c) \u201cIn view of escalating environmental degradation \r\n[L1297] and incipient resource depletion, would you favor \r\n[L1298] economic incentives for recycling of resource\ufffeintensive consumer goods?\u201d\r\n[L1299] 36. Checking for bias Comment on each of the fol\ufffelowing as a potential sample survey question. Is the \r\n[L1300] question clear? Is it slanted toward a desired response?\r\n[L1301] (a) Which of the following best represents your \r\n[L1302] opinion on gun control?\r\n[L1303] 1.

This section is about \r\n[L1408] statistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\n[L1409] Observational Study versus Experiment\r\n[L1410] In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\n[L1411] ask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\n[L1412] response. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\n[L1413] of a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\n[L1414] DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\n[L1415] An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\n[L1416] does not attempt to influence the responses.\r\n[L1417] An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\n[L1418] responses.\r\n[L1419] The goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\n[L1420] to compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\n[L1421] of an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\n[L1422] response. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\n[L1423] way to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\n[L1424] see the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\n[L1425] is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\n[L1426] data. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\n[L1427] is one of the most important in statistics.\r\n[L1428] Does Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\n[L1429] after Menopause?\r\n[L1430] Observation versus experiment\r\n[L1431] Should women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\n[L1432] production of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\n[L1433] a heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\n[L1434] small compared with the benefits.\r\n[L1435] The evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\n[L1436] hormones with others who were not. But the women who chose to \r\n[L1437] take hormones were richer and better educated and saw doctors \r\n[L1438] more often than women who didn\u2019t take hormones. Because the \r\n[L1439] 4.2\r\n[L1440] In Section 4.2, \r\n[L1441] you\u2019ll learn about: \r\n[L1442] sObservational study \r\n[L1443] versus experiment\r\n[L1444] sThe language of \r\n[L1445] experiments\r\n[L1446] sHow to experiment \r\n[L1447] badly\r\n[L1448] sHow to experiment \r\n[L1449] well: The randomized \r\n[L1450] comparative experiment\r\n[L1451] sThree principles of \r\n[L1452] experimental design\r\n[L1453] sExperiments: What can \r\n[L1454] go wrong?\r\n[L1455] sInference for experiments\r\n[L1456] sBlocking\r\n[L1457] sMatched pairs design\r\n[L1458] Section 4.2 Experiments 231","[L1459] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 27 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://7aacadbacce6f03#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_26.jpg","size_bytes":68207,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1460] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>","[L1461] 232 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1462] women who took hormones did many other things to maintain their health, it isn\u2019t \r\n[L1463] surprising that they had fewer heart attacks.\r\n[L1464] To get convincing data on the link between hormone replacement and heart \r\n[L1465] attacks, we should do an experiment. Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L1466] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L1467] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L1468] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L1469] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L1470] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L1471] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L1472] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L1473] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L1474] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L1475] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L1476] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L1477] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L1478] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L1479] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L1480] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L1481] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L1482] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L1483] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L1484] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L1485] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L1486] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L1487] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L1488] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L1489] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L1490] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L1491] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L1492] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L1493] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L1494] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L1495] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L1496] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L1497] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","[L1498] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1499] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","[L1500] Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L1501] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L1502] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L1503] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L1504] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L1505] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L1506] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L1507] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L1508] results of the earlier observational studies.

Here is the basic vocabulary of experiments.\r\n[L1526] DEFINITION: Treatment, experimental units, subjects\r\n[L1527] A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment.\r\n[L1528] If an experiment has several explanatory variables, a treatment is a combination of \r\n[L1529] specific values of these variables.\r\n[L1530] The experimental units are the smallest collection of individuals to which treatments \r\n[L1531] are applied. When the units are human beings, they often are called subjects.\r\n[L1532] The best way to learn the language of experiments is to practice using it.\r\n[L1533] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1534] are asked to identify a \r\n[L1535] possible confounding \r\n[L1536] variable in a given \r\n[L1537] setting, you are \r\n[L1538] expected to explain how \r\n[L1539] the variable you choose \r\n[L1540] (1) is associated with \r\n[L1541] the explanatory variable \r\n[L1542] and (2) affects the \r\n[L1543] response variable.","[L1544] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1545] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>","[L1546] 234 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1547] EXAMPLE When Will I Ever Use This Stuff?\r\n[L1548] Vocabulary of experiments\r\n[L1549] Researchers at the University of North Carolina were concerned about the \r\n[L1550] increasing dropout rate in the state\u2019s high schools, especially for low-income stu\ufffedents. Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\n[L1551] started to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\n[L1552] To change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\n[L1553] the topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\n[L1554] To test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\n[L1555] the schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\n[L1556] standard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\n[L1557] curriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\n[L1558] years, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\n[L1559] scores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\n[L1560] high school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\n[L1561] greater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\n[L1562] PROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\n[L1563] in the CareerStart experiment.\r\n[L1564] SOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\n[L1565] variable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\n[L1566] compares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\n[L1567] behavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\n[L1568] The previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\n[L1569] trying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\n[L1570] all 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\n[L1571] of schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\n[L1572] researchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\n[L1573] systematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\n[L1574] students from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\n[L1575] program made the difference.\r\n[L1576] Sometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\n[L1577] experiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\n[L1578] treatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\n[L1579] the factors. Here\u2019s an example of a multifactor experiment.\r\n[L1580] Factors\r\n[L1581] Level\r\n[L1582] For Practice Try Exercise 51","[L1583] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://26b92d516ab78a7#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_29.jpg","size_bytes":63833,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1584] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>","[L1585] Section 4.2 Experiments 235\r\n[L1586] EXAMPLE TV Advertising\r\n[L1587] Experiments with multiple explanatory variables\r\n[L1588] What are the effects of repeated exposure to an advertising message? The answer \r\n[L1589] may depend on both the length of the ad and on how often it is repeat\ufffeed. An experiment investigated this question using undergraduate stu\ufffedents as subjects. All subjects viewed a 40-minute television program \r\n[L1590] that included ads for a digital camera. Some subjects saw a 30-second \r\n[L1591] commercial; others, a 90-second version. The same commercial was \r\n[L1592] shown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After viewing, all the \r\n[L1593] subjects answered questions about their recall of the ad, their attitude \r\n[L1594] toward the camera, and their intention to purchase it.21\r\n[L1595] PROBLEM: For the advertising study,\r\n[L1596] (a) identify the explanatory and response variables, and\r\n[L1597] (b) list all the treatments.\r\n[L1598] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1599] (a) This experiment has 2 explanatory variables (factors): \r\n[L1600] length of the commercial and number of repetitions. The response \r\n[L1601] variables include measures of subjects\u2019 recall of the ad, their \r\n[L1602] attitudes about the digital camera, and whether they intend to \r\n[L1603] purchase it.\r\n[L1604] (b) There are 2 different lengths of commercial (30 and 90 seconds) \r\n[L1605] and three different numbers of repetitions (1, 3, and 5). The 6 combi\ufffenations consisting of one level of each factor form the 6 treatments \r\n[L1606] shown in Figure 4.3: (1) 30 seconds, 1 time; (2) 30 seconds, 3 times; \r\n[L1607] (3) 30 seconds, 5 times; (4) 90 seconds, 1 time; (5) 90 seconds, \r\n[L1608] 3 times; (6) 90 seconds, 5 times.\r\n[L1609] This example shows how experiments allow us to study the combined effect of \r\n[L1610] several factors. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\n[L1611] not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\n[L1612] commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\n[L1613] interest. But if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers \r\n[L1614] get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. The two-factor experiment in \r\n[L1615] the TV advertising example will help us find out.\r\n[L1616] How to Experiment Badly \r\n[L1617] Experiments are the preferred method for examining the effect of one variable on \r\n[L1618] another. By imposing the specific treatment of interest and controlling other \r\n[L1619] influences, we can pin down cause and effect. Good designs are essential for \r\n[L1620] effective experiments, just as they are for sampling.

This year, budget cuts will allow the school to offer only an \r\n[L1649] online version of the course. Over the past 10 years, the average SAT \r\n[L1650] score of students in the classroom course was 1620. The online group \r\n[L1651] gets an average score of 1780. That\u2019s roughly 10% higher than the long\ufffetime average for those who took the classroom review course. Is the \r\n[L1652] online course more effective?\r\n[L1653] This experiment has a very simple design. A group of subjects (the \r\n[L1654] students) were exposed to a treatment (the online course), and the \r\n[L1655] outcome (SAT scores) was observed. Here is the design:\r\n[L1656] Students \u2192 Online course \u2192 SAT scores\r\n[L1657] A closer look showed that the students in the online review course \r\n[L1658] were quite different from the students who took the classroom course \r\n[L1659] in past years. They had higher GPAs and were taking more AP classes.\r\n[L1660] The effect of online versus in-class instruction is mixed up with the \r\n[L1661] effect of these lurking variables. Maybe the online students earned \r\n[L1662] higher SAT scores because they were smarter to begin with, not \r\n[L1663] because the online course prepared them better. This confounding \r\n[L1664] prevents us from concluding that the online course is more effective than class\uffferoom instruction.\r\n[L1665] Many laboratory experiments use a design like the one in the online SAT course \r\n[L1666] example:\r\n[L1667] Experimental units \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Measure response\r\n[L1668] In the lab environment, simple designs often work well. Field experiments and \r\n[L1669] experiments with animals or people deal with more variable conditions.

Most well-designed experiments compare \r\n[L1675] two or more treatments.\r\n[L1676] Comparison alone isn\u2019t enough to produce results we can trust. If the treat\ufffements are given to groups that differ greatly when the experiment begins, bias will \r\n[L1677] result.

Put all the slips in a hat and mix them thoroughly. Draw them out one \r\n[L1703] at a time until you have 25 slips. These 25 students will take the online course. The \r\n[L1704] remaining 25 students will take the classroom course. Alternatively, you could write \r\n[L1705] \u201conline\u201d on 25 of the slips and \u201cclassroom\u201d on the other 25 slips. Then put the slips in \r\n[L1706] a hat and mix them well. Have students come up one by one and (without looking) pick a slip from the \r\n[L1707] hat.

It is randomized because the sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments by chance. The diagram in Figure 4.4 presents \r\n[L1725] the details: random assignment, the sizes of the groups and which treatment they \r\n[L1726] receive, and the response variable. There are, as we will see later, statistical rea\ufffesons for using treatment groups that are about equal in size.

It does \r\n[L1748] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L1749] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L1750] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L1751] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L1752] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L1753] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L1754] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1755] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L1756] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L1757] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L1758] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L1759] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L1760] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L1761] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L1762] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L1763] than it really is.\r\n[L1764] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments. Here \r\n[L1765] is an experiment that compares three treatments.\r\n[L1766] ?\r\n[L1767] THINK\r\n[L1768] ABOUT\r\n[L1769] IT","[L1770] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 34 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://805b683d71708bc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_33.jpg","size_bytes":52261,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1771] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 75>","[L1772] Section 4.2 Experiments 239\r\n[L1773] EXAMPLE Conserving Energy\r\n[L1774] A completely randomized design\r\n[L1775] Many utility companies have introduced programs to encourage energy con\ufffeservation among their customers. An electric company considers placing small \r\n[L1776] digital displays in households to show current electricity use and what the cost \r\n[L1777] would be if this use continued for a month. Will the displays reduce electricity \r\n[L1778] use? One cheaper approach is to give customers a chart and information about \r\n[L1779] monitoring their electricity use from their outside meter. Would this method \r\n[L1780] work almost as well? The company decides to conduct an experiment to com\ufffepare these two approaches (display, chart) with a control group of customers \r\n[L1781] who receive information about energy consumption but no help in monitoring \r\n[L1782] electricity use.\r\n[L1783] PROBLEM: Outline a completely randomized design involving 60 single-family residences in the \r\n[L1784] same city who are willing to participate in such an experiment.

You might be thinking that the change \r\n[L1843] in electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\n[L1844] would tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\n[L1845] Suppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\n[L1846] households might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\n[L1847] whether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\n[L1848] confounding?!)\r\n[L1849] Many experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\n[L1850] group that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\n[L1851] an active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\n[L1852] developed drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\n[L1853] work. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\n[L1854] control group.\r\n[L1855] Some experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group. That\u2019s appropriate \r\n[L1856] if researchers simply want to compare the effects of several treatments, and not \r\n[L1857] to determine whether any of them works better than an inactive treatment. For \r\n[L1858] instance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\n[L1859] of paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\n[L1860] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L1861] Music students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately.

Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L1863] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L1864] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L1865] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L1866] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L1867] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment.

Provide enough detail that \r\n[L1870] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L1871] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L1872] Three Principles of \r\n[L1873] Experimental Design\r\n[L1874] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L1875] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L1876] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L1877] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L1878] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1879] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L1880] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L1881] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L1882] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1883] ?\r\n[L1884] THINK\r\n[L1885] ABOUT\r\n[L1886] IT","[L1887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","[L1888] Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L1889] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1890] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L1891] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L1892] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L1893] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L1894] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L1895] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L1896] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L1897] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L1898] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L1899] between the groups.\r\n[L1900] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L1901] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L1902] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L1903] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L1904] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L1905] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L1906] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L1907] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L1908] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L1909] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L1910] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L1911] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L1912] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L1913] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L1914] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L1915] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L1916] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L1917] experiment.\r\n[L1918] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L1919] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L1920] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks? The Phy\ufffesicians\u2019 Health Study was a medical experiment that helped answer this ques\ufffetion. In fact, the Physicians\u2019 Health Study looked at the effects of two drugs: \r\n[L1921] aspirin and beta-carotene. Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\n[L1922] help prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\n[L1923] male physicians. There were two explanatory variables (factors), each having \r\n[L1924] two levels: aspirin (yes or no) and beta-carotene (yes or no).

One\ufffefourth of the subjects were assigned at random to each of these treatments.\r\n[L1931] On odd-numbered days, the subjects took either a tablet that contained as\ufffepirin or a dummy pill that looked and tasted like the aspirin but had no \r\n[L1932] active ingredient (a placebo). On even-numbered days, they took either a \r\n[L1933] capsule containing beta-carotene or a placebo. There were several response \r\n[L1934] variables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\n[L1935] other medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\n[L1936] only 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\n[L1937] large enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\n[L1938] attacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\n[L1939] preventing cancer.\r\n[L1940] PROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\n[L1941] design was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\n[L1942] SOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\n[L1943] lurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\n[L1944] treatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\n[L1945] schedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\n[L1946] which subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\n[L1947] helped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\n[L1948] begin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\n[L1949] replication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\n[L1950] the groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\n[L1951] the random assignment.\r\n[L1952] The control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n[L1953] (placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\n[L1954] Experiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L1955] The logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\n[L1956] all the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\n[L1957] that all subjects really are treated identically.\r\n[L1958] If some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\n[L1959] group takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\n[L1960] the subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\n[L1961] experiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\n[L1962] On even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo. Many patients respond favorably to any treatment, even a placebo, perhaps \r\n[L1963] because they trust the doctor. The response to a dummy treatment is called the \r\n[L1964] Placebo\r\n[L1965] Factor 1:\r\n[L1966] Aspirin\r\n[L1967] Factor 2: Beta-carotene\r\n[L1968] Yes\r\n[L1969] Yes No\r\n[L1970] Aspirin Beta-carotene Aspirin Placebo\r\n[L1971] No\r\n[L1972] Placebo Beta-carotene Placebo Placebo\r\n[L1973] FIGURE 4.6 The treatments in the \r\n[L1974] Physicians\u2019 Health Study.","[L1975] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 38 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b06f1b5c1816f6a#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_37.jpg","size_bytes":61000,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1976] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>","[L1977] Section 4.2 Experiments 243\r\n[L1978] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1979] placebo effect.

Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\n[L1985] that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\n[L1986] heads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n[L1987] 24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\n[L1988] active medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\n[L1989] the pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\n[L1990] significantly less pain.24\r\n[L1991] When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\n[L1992] that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\n[L1993] placebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\n[L1994] treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\n[L1995] enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\n[L1996] place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\n[L1997] The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\n[L1998] their hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\n[L1999] beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\n[L2000] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L2001] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L2002] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L2003] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L2004] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L2005] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L2006] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L2007] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L2008] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L2009] Placebo effect","[L2010] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2011] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>","[L2012] 244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2013] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L2014] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L2015] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L2016] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L2017] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L2018] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L2019] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L2020] the response variable do know.\r\n[L2021] Single-blind\r\n[L2022] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L2023] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L2024] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L2025] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L2026] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L2027] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L2028] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L2029] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\n[L2030] received the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n[L2031] 1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n[L2032] 2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n[L2033] 3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L2034] experiment.\r\n[L2035] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L2036] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L2037] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L2038] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L2039] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L2040] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L2041] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L2042] significant.\r\n[L2043] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L2044] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L2045] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L2046] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L2047] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation. A statistically sig\ufffenificant association in data from a well-designed experiment does imply causation.","[L2048] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b86211c359fd2c0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_39.jpg","size_bytes":53857,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2049] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 41 / 75>","[L2050] Section 4.2 Experiments 245\r\n[L2051] ACTIVITY Distracted driving\r\n[L2052] MATERIALS: Deck of cards for each team of 3 to 4 students\r\n[L2053] Is talking on a cell phone while driving more distracting than talking to \r\n[L2054] a passenger? David Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah \r\n[L2055] designed an experiment to help answer this question. They used 48 un\ufffedergraduate students as subjects. The researchers randomly assigned half \r\n[L2056] of the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\n[L2057] the other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger. One \r\n[L2058] response variable was whether the driver stopped at a rest area that was \r\n[L2059] specified by researchers before the simulation started.

We need 48 cards from the deck to represent the drivers in this study. In the \r\n[L2069] original experiment, 33 drivers stopped at the rest area and 15 didn\u2019t. Since \r\n[L2070] we\u2019re assuming that the treatment received won\u2019t change whether each driver \r\n[L2071] stops at the rest area, we use 33 cards to represent drivers who stop and 15 cards \r\n[L2072] to represent those who don\u2019t.

Let\u2019s return \r\n[L2104] to the distracted-driver Activity. Some people are more forgetful than others. Sup\ufffepose that the random assignment happens to put most of the forgetful subjects in \r\n[L2105] one group. If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L2106] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L2107] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L2108] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L2109] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L2110] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L2111] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L2112] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L2113] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L2114] response to the treatments.\r\n[L2115] Blocking\r\n[L2116] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L2117] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L2118] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L2119] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L2120] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

How \r\n[L2132] should researchers deal with the fact that light-colored cloth\ufffeing tends to come cleaner in warm water? They could \r\n[L2133] use a completely randomized design and hope that the \r\n[L2134] random assignment distributes the light-colored clothing \r\n[L2135] about evenly between the cold- and warm-water treatment \r\n[L2136] groups.

The idea is to create blocks by matching pairs of similar \r\n[L2262] experimental units. Then we can use chance to decide which member of a pair \r\n[L2263] gets the first treatment. The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L2264] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L2265] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L2266] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L2267] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L2268] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L2269] Matched pairs design\r\n[L2270] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L2271] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L2272] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L2273] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L2274] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L2275] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L2276] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L2277] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L2278] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L2279] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L2280] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L2281] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L2282] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L2283] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L2284] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L2285] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates?

We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\n[L2312] EXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\n[L2313] Design determines analysis\r\n[L2314] A Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\n[L2315] randomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\n[L2316] standing group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n[L2317] 68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\n[L2318] higher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\n[L2319] pulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\n[L2320] graph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\n[L2321] standing pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\n[L2322] What about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\n[L2323] Fathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\n[L2324] rates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\n[L2325] difference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n[L2326] 24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\n[L2327] standing pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\n[L2328] evidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\n[L2329] Let\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\n[L2330] that we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\n[L2331] experimental designs. Blocking by subject in the matched pairs design greatly \r\n[L2332] reduced the variability in the response variable. That made it easier to detect \r\n[L2333] the fact that standing causes an increase in pulse rate. With the large amount \r\n[L2334] of variability in the completely randomized design, we were unable to draw \r\n[L2335] such a conclusion.","[L2336] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5c9678406de9a79#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_45.jpg","size_bytes":52515,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2337] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 47 / 75>","[L2338] Section 4.2 Experiments 251\r\n[L2339] Another important lesson to take away from the example is this: the design of the \r\n[L2340] study determines the appropriate method of analysis. For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\n[L2341] dotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\n[L2342] compare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\n[L2343] The following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\n[L2344] analyzing data from an experiment.\r\n[L2345] DATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\n[L2346] Most automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n[L2347] 78% nitrogen. Aircraft tires are filled with pure nitrogen, which is safer than air \r\n[L2348] in case of fire. Could filling automobile tires with nitrogen improve safety, perfor\ufffemance, or both?\r\n[L2349] Consumers Union designed a study to test whether nitrogen-filled tires would \r\n[L2350] maintain pressure better than air-filled tires. They obtained two tires from each of \r\n[L2351] several brands and then filled one tire in each pair with air and one with nitrogen. \r\n[L2352] All tires were inflated to a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch and then placed \r\n[L2353] outside for a year. At the end of the year, Consumers Union measured the pres\ufffesure in each tire. The amount of pressure lost (in pounds per square inch) during \r\n[L2354] the year for the air-filled and nitrogen-filled tires of each brand is shown in the \r\n[L2355] table below.29\r\n[L2356] Brand Air Nitrogen Brand Air Nitrogen\r\n[L2357] BF Goodrich Traction T/A HR 7.6 7.2 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 4.4 4.2\r\n[L2358] Bridgestone HP50 (Sears) 3.8 2.5 Sumitomo HTR H4 1.4 2.1\r\n[L2359] Bridgestone Potenza G009 3.7 1.6 Yokohama Avid H4S 4.3 3.0\r\n[L2360] Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.7 1.5 BF Goodrich Traction T/A V 5.5 3.4\r\n[L2361] Bridgestone Potenza EL400 2.1 1.0 Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.1 2.8\r\n[L2362] Continental Premier Contact H 4.9 3.1 Continental ContiExtreme Contact 5.0 3.4\r\n[L2363] Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 5.2 3.5 Continental ContiProContact 4.8 3.3\r\n[L2364] Dayton Daytona HR 3.4 3.2 Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 3.2 2.5\r\n[L2365] Falken Ziex ZE-512 4.1 3.3 General Exclaim UHP 6.8 2.7\r\n[L2366] Fuzion Hrl 2.7 2.2 Hankook Ventus V4 H105 3.1 1.4\r\n[L2367] General Exclaim 3.1 3.4 Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.5 1.5\r\n[L2368] Goodyear Assurance Tripletred 3.8 3.2 Michelin Pilot Exalto A/S 6.6 2.2\r\n[L2369] Hankook Optimo H418 3.0 0.9 Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 2.2 2.0\r\n[L2370] Kumho Solus KH16 6.2 3.4 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 2.5 2.7\r\n[L2371] Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.0 1.8 Sumitomo HTR+ 4.4 3.7\r\n[L2372] Michelin Pilot XGT H4 1.1 0.7\r\n[L2373] Does filling tires with nitrogen instead of compressed air reduce pressure loss? \r\n[L2374] Give appropriate graphical and numerical evidence to support your answer.","[L2375] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>","[L2376] 252 CHAPTER CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2377] s We can produce data intended to answer specific questions by observational\r\n[L2378] studies or experiments. An observational study gathers data on individuals \r\n[L2379] as they are. Experiments actively do something to people, animals, or \r\n[L2380] objects in order to measure their response.\r\n[L2381] s Statistical studies often try to show that changing one variable (the \r\n[L2382] explanatory variable) causes changes in another variable (the response\r\n[L2383] variable). Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\n[L2384] be distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\n[L2385] experiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\n[L2386] actually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\n[L2387] variable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\n[L2388] s In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\n[L2389] is a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\n[L2390] s The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\n[L2391] manner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\n[L2392] principles of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\n[L2393] assignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\n[L2394] s The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\n[L2395] two or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\n[L2396] with other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\n[L2397] s Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\n[L2398] Random assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\n[L2399] chance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\n[L2400] comparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\n[L2401] s Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\n[L2402] reduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\n[L2403] likely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\n[L2404] s Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\n[L2405] neither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\n[L2406] responses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\n[L2407] the other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\n[L2408] s Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\n[L2409] That helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\n[L2410] patients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\n[L2411] they have received an inactive treatment.\r\n[L2412] s In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\n[L2413] individuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\n[L2414] Randomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\n[L2415] helps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\n[L2416] s Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\n[L2417] treatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\n[L2418] treatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\n[L2419] closely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\n[L2420] Summary SECTION 4.2","[L2421] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","[L2423] Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n[L2424] 45.

Researchers began by \r\n[L2428] asking 305 healthy pregnant women to report their \r\n[L2429] chocolate consumption. Six months after birth, the \r\n[L2430] researchers asked mothers to rate their infants\u2019 tem\ufffeperament, including smiling, laughter, and fear.

Learning biology with computers An educator wants \r\n[L2452] to compare the effectiveness of computer software for \r\n[L2453] teaching biology with that of a textbook presentation. \r\n[L2454] She gives a biology pretest to each of a group of high \r\n[L2455] school juniors, then randomly divides them into \r\n[L2456] two groups. One group uses the computer, and the \r\n[L2457] other studies the text.

Cell phones and brain cancer One study of cell \r\n[L2467] phones and the risk of brain cancer looked at a group \r\n[L2468] of 469 people who have brain cancer. The investiga\ufffetors matched each cancer patient with a person of \r\n[L2469] the same age, gender, and race who did not have \r\n[L2470] brain cancer, then asked about the use of cell phones. \r\n[L2471] Result: \u201cOur data suggest that the use of handheld \r\n[L2472] cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain \r\n[L2473] cancer.\u201d32\r\n[L2474] (a) Is this an observational study or an experiment? \r\n[L2475] Justify your answer.\r\n[L2476] (b) Based on this study, would you conclude that cell \r\n[L2477] phones do not increase the risk of brain cancer?

Effects of class size Do smaller classes in elementary \r\n[L2480] school really benefit students in areas such as scores \r\n[L2481] on standardized tests, staying in school, and going on \r\n[L2482] to college? We might do an observational study that \r\n[L2483] compares students who happened to be in smaller \r\n[L2484] and larger classes in their early school years. Identify \r\n[L2485] a lurking variable that may lead to confounding with \r\n[L2486] the effects of small classes. Explain how confounding \r\n[L2487] might occur.\r\n[L2488] 50. Effects of binge drinking A common definition of \r\n[L2489] \u201cbinge drinking\u201d is 5 or more drinks at one sitting for \r\n[L2490] men and 4 or more for women. An observational study \r\n[L2491] finds that students who binge drink have lower average \r\n[L2492] GPA than those who don\u2019t. Identify a lurking variable \r\n[L2493] that may be confounded with the effects of binge \r\n[L2494] drinking.

Improving response rate How can we reduce the \r\n[L2521] rate of refusals in telephone surveys? Most people \r\n[L2522] who answer at all listen to the interviewer\u2019s introduc\ufffetory remarks and then decide whether to continue. \r\n[L2523] One study made telephone calls to randomly selected \r\n[L2524] households to ask opinions about the next election. In \r\n[L2525] some calls, the interviewer gave her name, in others \r\n[L2526] she identified the university she was representing, \r\n[L2527] and in still others she identified both herself and the \r\n[L2528] university. For each type of call, the interviewer either \r\n[L2529] did or did not offer to send a copy of the final survey \r\n[L2530] results to the person interviewed. Do these differences \r\n[L2531] in the introduction affect whether the interview is \r\n[L2532] completed?\r\n[L2533] 54. Eat well and exercise Most American adolescents \r\n[L2534] don\u2019t eat well and don\u2019t exercise enough. Can middle \r\n[L2535] schools increase physical activity among \r\n[L2536] their students? Can they persuade students to eat \r\n[L2537] better? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\n[L2538] intervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\n[L2539] school day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\n[L2540] for healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\n[L2541] school was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention. The \r\n[L2542] investigators observed physical activity and lunchtime \r\n[L2543] consumption of fat.\r\n[L2544] 55. Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\n[L2545] will use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\n[L2546] raise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\n[L2547] either 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n[L2548] 150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\n[L2549] combinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\n[L2550] fabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\n[L2551] for quality.\r\n[L2552] 56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\n[L2553] the increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\n[L2554] they stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\n[L2555] beat of a metronome. The step was either 5.75 or 11.5 \r\n[L2556] inches high and the metronome beat was 14, 21, or \r\n[L2557] 28 steps per minute. Five students stepped at each \r\n[L2558] combination of height and speed.\r\n[L2559] 57. Cocoa and blood flow A study conducted by Nor\ufffeman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham \r\n[L2560] and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, \r\n[L2561] involved 27 healthy people aged 18 to 72. Each \r\n[L2562] subject consumed a cocoa beverage containing 900 \r\n[L2563] milligrams of flavonols (a class of flavonoids) daily \r\n[L2564] for five days. Using a finger cuff, blood flow was mea\ufffesured on the first and fifth days of the study. After five \r\n[L2565] days, researchers measured what they called \u201csignifi\ufffecant improvement\u201d in blood flow and the function of \r\n[L2566] the cells that line the blood vessels.33 What flaw in the \r\n[L2567] design of this experiment makes it impossible to say \r\n[L2568] whether the cocoa really caused the improved blood \r\n[L2569] flow? Explain.\r\n[L2570] 58. Reducing unemployment Will cash bonuses speed \r\n[L2571] the return to work of unemployed people? A state \r\n[L2572] department of labor notes that last year 68% of people \r\n[L2573] who filed claims for unemployment insurance found \r\n[L2574] a new job within 15 weeks. As an experiment, this year \r\n[L2575] the state offers $500 to people filing unemployment \r\n[L2576] claims if they find a job within 15 weeks. The percent \r\n[L2577] who do so increases to 77%. What flaw in the design \r\n[L2578] of this experiment makes it impossible to say whether \r\n[L2579] the bonus really caused the increase? Explain.\r\n[L2580] 59.

Then carry out \r\n[L2632] your random assignment.\r\n[L2633] 62. More rain for California? The changing climate will \r\n[L2634] probably bring more rain to California, but we don\u2019t \r\n[L2635] know whether the additional rain will come during the \r\n[L2636] winter wet season or extend into the long dry season in \r\n[L2637] spring and summer. Kenwyn Suttle of the University \r\n[L2638] of California at Berkeley and his coworkers carried \r\n[L2639] out an experiment to study the effects of more rain in \r\n[L2640] either season. They randomly assigned plots of open \r\n[L2641] grassland to 3 treatments: added water equal to 20% of \r\n[L2642] annual rainfall either during January to March (winter) \r\n[L2643] or during April to June (spring), and no added water \r\n[L2644] (control). Thirty-six circular plots of area 70 square me\ufffeters were available (see the photo), of which 18 were \r\n[L2645] used for this study. One response variable was total \r\n[L2646] plant biomass, in grams per square meter, produced in \r\n[L2647] a plot over a year.35\r\n[L2648] (a) Outline the design of the experiment. What is \r\n[L2649] this type of design called?\r\n[L2650] (b) Explain how you would randomly assign the \r\n[L2651] experimental units to the three treatments. Then \r\n[L2652] carry out your random assignment.\r\n[L2653] 63. Treating prostate disease A large study used records \r\n[L2654] from Canada\u2019s national health care system to com\ufffepare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate \r\n[L2655] disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery \r\n[L2656] and a new method that does not require surgery. The \r\n[L2657] records described many patients whose doctors had \r\n[L2658] chosen each method. The study found that patients \r\n[L2659] treated by the new method were significantly more \r\n[L2660] likely to die within 8 years.36\r\n[L2661] (a) Further study of the data showed that this conclu\ufffesion was wrong. The extra deaths among patients who \r\n[L2662] got the new method could be explained by lurking vari\ufffeables. What lurking variables might be confounded with \r\n[L2663] a doctor\u2019s choice of surgical or nonsurgical treatment?\r\n[L2664] (b) You have 300 prostate patients who are willing to \r\n[L2665] serve as subjects in an experiment to compare the two \r\n[L2666] methods. Write a few sentences describing how you \r\n[L2667] would design this experiment.\r\n[L2668] 64. Getting teachers to come to school Elementary \r\n[L2669] schools in rural India are usually small, with a single \r\n[L2670] teacher. The teachers often fail to show up for work. \r\n[L2671] Here is an idea for improving attendance: give the \r\n[L2672] teacher a digital camera with a tamperproof time \r\n[L2673] and date stamp and ask a student to take a photo of \r\n[L2674] the teacher and class at the beginning and end of the \r\n[L2675] day. Offer the teacher better pay for good attendance, \r\n[L2676] verified by the photos. Will this work? Researchers \r\n[L2677] obtained permission to use 120 rural schools in \r\n[L2678] Rajasthan for an experiment to find out.37\r\n[L2679] (a) Explain why it would not be a good idea to offer \r\n[L2680] better pay for good attendance to the teachers in all \r\n[L2681] 120 schools and then to compare this year\u2019s atten\ufffedance with last year\u2019s.\r\n[L2682] (b) Write a few sentences describing how you would \r\n[L2683] design this experiment.\r\n[L2684] 65. Stronger players A football coach hears that a new \r\n[L2685] exercise program will increase upper-body strength \r\n[L2686] better than lifting weights. He is eager to test this new \r\n[L2687] program in the off-season with the players on his high \r\n[L2688] school team. The coach decides to let his players \r\n[L2689] choose which of the two treatments they will undergo \r\n[L2690] for 3 weeks\u2014exercise or weight lifting. He will use \r\n[L2691] the number of push-ups a player can do at the end of \r\n[L2692] the experiment as the response variable.\r\n[L2693] (a) Which principle of experimental design does the \r\n[L2694] coach\u2019s plan violate? Explain how this violation could \r\n[L2695] lead to confounding.\r\n[L2696] (b) Comment on the coach\u2019s choice of response \r\n[L2697] variable.\r\n[L2698] 66. Prayer and meditation You read in a magazine \r\n[L2699] that \u201cnonphysical treatments such as meditation and \r\n[L2700] prayer have been shown to be effective in controlled \r\n[L2701] scientific studies for such ailments as high blood \r\n[L2702] pg 239","[L2703] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 51 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://108fc5c94b0996f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_50.jpg","size_bytes":71434,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2704] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 52 / 75>","[L2705] 256 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2706] pressure, insomnia, ulcers, and asthma.\u201d Explain \r\n[L2707] in simple language what the article means by \r\n[L2708] \u201ccontrolled scientific studies.\u201d Why can such studies \r\n[L2709] provide good evidence that meditation is an effective \r\n[L2710] treatment for high blood pressure?\r\n[L2711] 67. The effects of day care Does day care help low\ufffeincome children stay in school and hold good jobs \r\n[L2712] later in life? The Carolina Abecedarian Project (the \r\n[L2713] name suggests the ABCs) has followed a group of \r\n[L2714] 111 children since 1972. Back then, these individu\ufffeals were all healthy but low-income black infants in \r\n[L2715] Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All the infants received \r\n[L2716] nutritional supplements and help from social workers. \r\n[L2717] Half were also assigned at random to an intensive \r\n[L2718] preschool program.38\r\n[L2719] (a) Explain the purpose of each of the three experi\ufffemental design principles.\r\n[L2720] (b) Describe how each of these principles was used \r\n[L2721] in this study.\r\n[L2722] 68. Killing weeds A biologist would like to determine \r\n[L2723] which of two brands of weed killer is less likely to \r\n[L2724] harm the plants in a garden at the university. Before \r\n[L2725] spraying near the plants, the biologist decides to \r\n[L2726] conduct an experiment using 24 individual plants. \r\n[L2727] Which of the following two plans for randomly \r\n[L2728] assigning the treatments should the biologist use? \r\n[L2729] Why?\r\n[L2730] Plan A: Choose the 12 healthiest-looking plants. \r\n[L2731] Apply Brand X weed killer to all 12 of those plants. \r\n[L2732] Apply Brand Y weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2733] Plan B: Choose 12 of the 24 plants at random. Apply \r\n[L2734] Brand X weed killer to those 12 plants and Brand Y \r\n[L2735] weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2736] 69. Do placebos really work? Researchers in Japan \r\n[L2737] conducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\n[L2738] were extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\n[L2739] each subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\n[L2740] told the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\n[L2741] subject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\n[L2742] was poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\n[L2743] the arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n[L2744] 13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\n[L2745] poison ivy leaf.39\r\n[L2746] (a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n[L2747] (b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\n[L2748] idea of a placebo effect.\r\n[L2749] 70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\n[L2750] chronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\n[L2751] and needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\n[L2752] will be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\n[L2753] percent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n[L2754] (a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\n[L2755] drug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n[L2756] (b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\n[L2757] getting the new drug or a placebo? How would this \r\n[L2758] knowledge probably affect their reactions?\r\n[L2759] 71. Meditation for anxiety An experiment that claimed \r\n[L2760] to show that meditation lowers anxiety proceeded as \r\n[L2761] follows. The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\n[L2762] and rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\n[L2763] were randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\n[L2764] meditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\n[L2765] simply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\n[L2766] the experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\n[L2767] and rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\n[L2768] now had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\n[L2769] Explain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\n[L2770] could bias the reported results.\r\n[L2771] 72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\n[L2772] testosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\n[L2773] cause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\n[L2774] fat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\n[L2775] supplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\n[L2776] in the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\n[L2777] with low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\n[L2778] a testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\n[L2779] in the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\n[L2780] described the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\n[L2781] placebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\n[L2782] terms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n[L2783] 73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\n[L2784] determine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\n[L2785] acupuncture could help infertile women become \r\n[L2786] pregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\n[L2787] undergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\n[L2788] were recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\n[L2789] randomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n[L2790] 25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\n[L2791] minutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\n[L2792] were instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\n[L2793] embryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n[L2794] 34 women became pregnant. In the control group, \r\n[L2795] 21 women became pregnant.\r\n[L2796] (a) Describe how the three principles of experimen\ufffetal design were addressed in this study.\r\n[L2797] (b) The difference in the percent of women who \r\n[L2798] became pregnant in the two groups is statistically \r\n[L2799] significant. Explain what this means to someone who \r\n[L2800] knows little statistics.\r\n[L2801] (c) Explain why the placebo effect prevents us from \r\n[L2802] concluding that acupuncture caused the difference in \r\n[L2803] pregnancy rates.\r\n[L2804] pg 241","[L2805] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>","[L2806] Section 4.2 Experiments 257\r\n[L2807] 74. Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\n[L2808] colleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\n[L2809] Half of the participants were randomly assigned \r\n[L2810] to a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\n[L2811] assigned to a low-fat diet. Researchers measured each \r\n[L2812] participant\u2019s change in weight and cholesterol level \r\n[L2813] after six months and again after one year. Subjects in \r\n[L2814] the low-carb diet group lost significantly more weight \r\n[L2815] than subjects in the low-fat diet group during the first \r\n[L2816] six months of the study. At the end of a year, however, \r\n[L2817] the average weight loss for subjects in the two groups \r\n[L2818] was not significantly different.42\r\n[L2819] (a) Why did researchers randomly assign the subjects \r\n[L2820] to the diet treatments?\r\n[L2821] (b) Explain to someone who knows little statistics \r\n[L2822] what \u201clost significantly more weight\u201d means.\r\n[L2823] (c) The subjects in the low-carb diet group lost an aver\ufffeage of 5.1 kg in a year. The subjects in the low-fat diet \r\n[L2824] group lost an average of 3.1 kg. Explain how this infor\ufffemation could be consistent with the fact that weight loss \r\n[L2825] in the two groups was not significantly different.\r\n[L2826] 75. Is yawning contagious? According to the popular \r\n[L2827] TV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\n[L2828] March 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\n[L2829] presented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\n[L2830] subjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\n[L2831] an extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\n[L2832] camera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\n[L2833] seed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\n[L2834] yawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\n[L2835] who had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\n[L2836] given a yawn seed, 10 yawned. Adam Savage and Ja\ufffemie Hyneman, the cohosts of Mythbusters, used these \r\n[L2837] results to conclude that yawning is contagious.\r\n[L2838] (a) Explain how you could use slips of paper to ran\ufffedomly reassign the subjects to the treatment groups.\r\n[L2839] (b) Suppose we used your method in (a) to redo the \r\n[L2840] random assignment 50 times.

The researchers decided to \r\n[L2846] analyze the patients\u2019 final pain ratings. It also makes \r\n[L2847] sense to examine the difference between patients\u2019 \r\n[L2848] initial pain ratings and their final pain ratings in both \r\n[L2849] groups.

A nutrition experimenter intends to \r\n[L2934] compare the weight gain of newly weaned male \r\n[L2935] rats fed Diet A with that of rats fed Diet B. To do this, \r\n[L2936] she will feed each diet to 10 rats. She has available \r\n[L2937] 10 rats from one litter and 10 rats from a second \r\n[L2938] litter. Rats in the first litter appear to be slightly \r\n[L2939] healthier.\r\n[L2940] (a) If the 10 rats from Litter 1 were fed Diet A, the \r\n[L2941] effects of genetics and diet would be confounded, and \r\n[L2942] the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A. \r\n[L2943] Explain this statement carefully.\r\n[L2944] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2945] 82. Technology for teaching statistics The Brigham \r\n[L2946] Young University (BYU) statistics department is \r\n[L2947] performing experiments to compare teaching meth\ufffeods. Response variables include students\u2019 final-exam \r\n[L2948] scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. \r\n[L2949] One study compares two levels of technology for large \r\n[L2950] lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) \r\n[L2951] and multimedia. There are 8 lecture sections of a \r\n[L2952] basic statistics course at BYU, each with about 200 \r\n[L2953] students. There are four instructors, each of whom \r\n[L2954] teaches two sections.44 Suppose the sections and \r\n[L2955] lecturers are as follows:\r\n[L2956] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2957] 1 Hilton\r\n[L2958] 2 Christensen\r\n[L2959] 3 Hadfield\r\n[L2960] 4 Hadfield\r\n[L2961] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2962] 5 Tolley\r\n[L2963] 6 Hilton\r\n[L2964] 7 Tolley\r\n[L2965] 8 Christensen\r\n[L2966] (a) Suppose we randomly assign two lecturers to use \r\n[L2967] standard technology in their sections and the other \r\n[L2968] two lecturers to use multimedia technology. Explain \r\n[L2969] how this could lead to confounding.\r\n[L2970] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2971] 83. Look, Ma, no hands! Does talking on a hands-free \r\n[L2972] cell phone distract drivers? Researchers recruit 40 \r\n[L2973] student subjects for an experiment to investigate \r\n[L2974] this question. They have a driving simulator \r\n[L2975] equipped with a hands-free phone for use in the \r\n[L2976] study.\r\n[L2977] (a) Researchers are considering the design shown in \r\n[L2978] the figure below.

Chocolate gets my heart pumping Cardiologists \r\n[L3000] at Athens Medical School in Greece wanted to test \r\n[L3001] whether chocolate affected blood flow in the blood \r\n[L3002] vessels. The researchers recruited 17 healthy young \r\n[L3003] volunteers, who were each given a 3.5-ounce bar of \r\n[L3004] dark chocolate, either bittersweet or fake chocolate. \r\n[L3005] On another day, the volunteers were switched. The \r\n[L3006] subjects had no chocolate outside the study, and \r\n[L3007] investigators didn\u2019t know whether a subject had eaten \r\n[L3008] the real or the fake chocolate. An ultrasound was \r\n[L3009] taken of each volunteer\u2019s upper arm to see the func\ufffetioning of the cells in the walls of the main artery. \r\n[L3010] The investigators found that blood vessel function was \r\n[L3011] improved when the subjects ate bittersweet chocolate, \r\n[L3012] and that there were no such changes when they ate \r\n[L3013] the placebo (fake chocolate).45\r\n[L3014] (a) What type of design did the investigators use in \r\n[L3015] their study?\r\n[L3016] (b) Explain why the investigators chose this design \r\n[L3017] instead of a completely randomized design.\r\n[L3018] (c) Why is it important to randomly assign the order \r\n[L3019] of the treatments for the subjects?\r\n[L3020] 85. Room temperature and dexterity An expert on \r\n[L3021] worker performance is interested in the effect of \r\n[L3022] room temperature on the performance of tasks \r\n[L3023] requiring manual dexterity. She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\n[L3024] variable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\n[L3025] a 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\n[L3026] requires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\n[L3027] subject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\n[L3028] make as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\n[L3029] continuous effort.\r\n[L3030] (a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\n[L3031] compare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\n[L3032] available.\r\n[L3033] (b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\n[L3034] wide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\n[L3035] subjects in each group. Describe in detail the design \r\n[L3036] of a matched pairs experiment in which each subject \r\n[L3037] serves as his or her own control.\r\n[L3038] 86. Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\n[L3039] of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\n[L3040] increasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\n[L3041] Because plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\n[L3042] CO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\n[L3043] An elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\n[L3044] CO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\n[L3045] the growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\n[L3046] untreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\n[L3047] growth. We can afford to treat three circular areas.46\r\n[L3048] (a) Describe the design of a completely randomized \r\n[L3049] experiment using 6 well-separated 30-meter circular \r\n[L3050] areas in a pine forest.

Sketch the circles and carry out the \r\n[L3056] randomization your design calls for.\r\n[L3057] 87. Got deodorant? A group of students wants to per\ufffeform an experiment to determine whether Brand A or \r\n[L3058] Brand B deodorant lasts longer. One group member \r\n[L3059] suggests the following design: Recruit 40 student \r\n[L3060] volunteers\u201420 male and 20 female. Separate by \r\n[L3061] gender, since male and female bodies might respond \r\n[L3062] differently to deodorant. Give all the males Brand A \r\n[L3063] deodorant and all the females Brand B. Have each \r\n[L3064] student rate how well the deodorant is still working \r\n[L3065] at the end of the school day on a 0 to 10 scale. Then \r\n[L3066] compare ratings for the two treatments.\r\n[L3067] (a) Identify any flaws you see in the proposed design \r\n[L3068] for this experiment.\r\n[L3069] (b) Describe how you would design the experiment. \r\n[L3070] Explain how your design addresses each of the \r\n[L3071] problems you identified in (a).\r\n[L3072] 88.

Justin \r\n[L3074] decides to conduct his own experiment to find out. \r\n[L3075] On Friday and Saturday nights, he doesn\u2019t set the \r\n[L3076] alarm before going to bed. On Monday and Tuesday, \r\n[L3077] he sets the alarm for 7 a.m. Justin records the time \r\n[L3078] when he wakes up each day and then compares his \r\n[L3079] average wake-up time with and without the alarm.\r\n[L3080] (a) Identify any flaws you see in the proposed design \r\n[L3081] for this experiment.\r\n[L3082] (b) Describe how you would design the experiment. \r\n[L3083] Explain how your design addresses each of the prob\ufffelems you identified in (a).\r\n[L3084] 89.

Can changing diet reduce high blood pressure? \r\n[L3098] Vegetarian diets and low-salt diets are both promising. \r\n[L3099] Men with high blood pressure are assigned at random \r\n[L3100] to four diets: (1) normal diet with unrestricted salt; \r\n[L3101] (2) vegetarian with unrestricted salt; (3) normal with \r\n[L3102] restricted salt; and (4) vegetarian with restricted salt. \r\n[L3103] This experiment has\r\n[L3104] (a) one factor, the type of diet.\r\n[L3105] (b) two factors, high blood pressure and type of diet.\r\n[L3106] (c) two factors, normal/vegetarian diet and unre\ufffestricted/restricted salt.\r\n[L3107] (d) three factors, men, high blood pressure, and type \r\n[L3108] of diet.\r\n[L3109] (e) four factors, the four diets being compared.\r\n[L3110] 92.

The Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Ces\ufffesation asked whether a community-wide advertising \r\n[L3119] campaign would reduce smoking.

One com\ufffemunity in each pair participated in the advertising \r\n[L3122] campaign and the other did not.

Is this \r\n[L3152] good evidence that ibuprofen is effective in prevent\ufffeing Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\r\n[L3153] (a) Yes, because the study was a randomized, \r\n[L3154] comparative experiment.\r\n[L3155] (b) No, because the effect of ibuprofen is confounded \r\n[L3156] with the placebo effect.\r\n[L3157] (c) Yes, because the results were published in a \r\n[L3158] reputable professional journal.\r\n[L3159] (d) No, because this is an observational study.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L3219] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L3220] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L3221] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L3222] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L3223] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L3224] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3225] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L3226] on the design of the study.\r\n[L3227] Scope of Inference\r\n[L3228] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L3229] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L3230] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L3231] results of the sample.\r\n[L3232] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L3233] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L3234] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L3235] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L3236] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L3237] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L3238] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L3239] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L3240] 4.3\r\n[L3241] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","[L3242] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3243] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","[L3244] 262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3245] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L3246] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L3247] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L3248] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L3249] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L3250] Yes No\r\n[L3251] Were individuals \r\n[L3252] randomly selected?\r\n[L3253] Yes\r\n[L3254] Inference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\n[L3255] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3256] No Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\n[L3257] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3258] Well-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\n[L3259] However, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\n[L3260] larger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\n[L3261] effect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\n[L3262] rules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\n[L3263] random sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\n[L3264] example illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\n[L3265] EXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\n[L3266] Determining scope of inference\r\n[L3267] A small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\n[L3268] The dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\n[L3269] Design 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3270] to take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L3271] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L3272] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L3273] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L3274] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3275] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L3276] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3277] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3278] part in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3279] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3280] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L3281] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3282] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L3283] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L3284] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L3285] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L3286] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L3287] SOLUTION:\r\n[L3288] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L3289] holds for a larger population of dental patients.

However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L3299] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L3300] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L3301] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L3302] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L3303] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L3304] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L3305] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L3306] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L3307] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L3308] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L3309] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L3310] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L3311] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L3312] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L3313] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L3314] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L3315] the town.\r\n[L3316] The Challenges of \r\n[L3317] Establishing Causation\r\n[L3318] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L3319] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L3320] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L3321] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L3322] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L3323] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L3324] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\n[L3325] Lack of realism\r\n[L3326] Do those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3327] since 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\n[L3328] showed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\n[L3329] But requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\n[L3330] What happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\n[L3331] all cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\n[L3332] For Practice Try Exercise 105","[L3333] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3334] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","[L3335] 264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3336] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3337] In some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\n[L3338] these important questions:\r\n[L3339] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L3340] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L3341] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L3342] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L3343] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L3344] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L3345] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L3346] studies.\r\n[L3347] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L3348] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L3349] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L3350] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L3351] Living with observational studies\r\n[L3352] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L3353] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L3354] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L3355] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L3356] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L3357] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L3358] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L3359] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L3360] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L3361] experiment?\r\n[L3362] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L3363] very strong.\r\n[L3364] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L3365] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L3366] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L3367] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L3368] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L3369] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L3370] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L3371] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L3372] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L3373] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L3374] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L3375] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L3376] cancer death among women.","[L3377] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3378] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","[L3379] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L3380] sThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\n[L3381] cigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\n[L3382] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L3383] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3384] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L3385] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L3386] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L3387] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\n[L3388] observational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\n[L3389] Data Ethics*\r\n[L3390] Medical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\n[L3391] Shouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\n[L3392] reasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L3393] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L3394] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L3395] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L3396] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L3397] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L3398] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L3399] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L3400] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L3401] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L3402] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L3403] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\n[L3404] knows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\n[L3405] the physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\n[L3406] sWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L3407] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L3408] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L3409] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L3410] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L3411] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\n[L3412] are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\n[L3413] data from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\n[L3414] Basic Data Ethics\r\n[L3415] All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\n[L3416] board charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\n[L3417] All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\n[L3418] before data are collected.\r\n[L3419] All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\n[L3420] groups of subjects may be made public.\r\n[L3421] *This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","[L3422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","[L3423] 266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3424] The law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\n[L3425] obey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\n[L3426] Institutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\n[L3427] to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\n[L3428] it is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\n[L3429] board, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\n[L3430] recruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\n[L3431] study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\n[L3432] are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\n[L3433] research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\n[L3434] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L3435] boards.\r\n[L3436] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L3437] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L3438] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L3439] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L3440] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L3441] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L3442] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L3443] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L3444] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L3445] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L3446] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L3447] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L3448] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L3449] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L3450] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity.

The best prac\ufffetice is to separate the identity of the study\u2019s participants from the rest of the data at \r\n[L3456] once. A clever computer search of several data bases might be able, by combining \r\n[L3457] information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and \r\n[L3458] other identification have been removed from the data available for search.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L3496] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L3497] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L3498] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L3499] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L3500] results.\r\n[L3501] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L3502] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L3503] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L3504] lurking variables.\r\n[L3505] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L3506] review board.

Researchers carried \r\n[L3515] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L3516] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\n[L3517] dotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\n[L3518] magnet).\r\n[L3519] The average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\n[L3520] and 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\n[L3521] significant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\n[L3522] The difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\n[L3523] too large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain.

According to \r\n[L3558] Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain,\r\n[L3559] women say nearly three times as many words per day \r\n[L3560] as men. Skeptical researchers devised a study to test \r\n[L3561] this claim.

The psychologist observes the students \r\n[L3604] through a one-way window and notes the changes in \r\n[L3605] their behavior during an evening of game playing. \r\n[L3606] Can the psychologist generalize the results of her \r\n[L3607] study to a team of employees that spends months \r\n[L3608] developing a new product that never works right and \r\n[L3609] is finally abandoned by their company? Explain.\r\n[L3610] 109.* Minimal risk? You have been invited to serve on \r\n[L3611] a college\u2019s institutional review board. You must \r\n[L3612] decide whether several research proposals qualify for \r\n[L3613] lighter review because they involve only minimal \r\n[L3614] risk to subjects. Federal regulations say that \u201cminimal \r\n[L3615] risk\u201d means the risks are no greater than \u201cthose \r\n[L3616] ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the \r\n[L3617] performance of routine physical or psychological \r\n[L3618] examinations or tests.\u201d That\u2019s vague. Which of these \r\n[L3619] do you think qualifies as \u201cminimal risk\u201d?\r\n[L3620] *Exercises 109 to 116: This is an important topic, but it is not \r\n[L3621] required for the AP Statistics exam.\r\n[L3622] pg 262\r\n[L3623] SECTION 4.3 Exercises","[L3624] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 66 / 75>","[L3625] 270 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3626] (a) Draw a drop of blood by pricking a finger to \r\n[L3627] measure blood sugar.\r\n[L3628] (b) Draw blood from the arm for a full set of blood tests.\r\n[L3629] (c) Insert a tube that remains in the arm, so that \r\n[L3630] blood can be drawn regularly.\r\n[L3631] 110.*Who reviews? Government regulations require that \r\n[L3632] institutional review boards consist of at least five people, \r\n[L3633] including at least one scientist, one nonscientist, and \r\n[L3634] one person from outside the institution. Most boards \r\n[L3635] are larger, but many contain just one outsider.\r\n[L3636] (a) Why should review boards contain people who \r\n[L3637] are not scientists?\r\n[L3638] (b) Do you think that one outside member is \r\n[L3639] enough?

One of the most impor\ufffetant nongovernment surveys in the United States is the \r\n[L3664] National Opinion Research Center\u2019s General Social \r\n[L3665] Survey. The GSS regularly monitors public opinion \r\n[L3666] on a wide variety of political and social issues. Inter\ufffeviews are conducted in person in the subject\u2019s home. \r\n[L3667] Are a subject\u2019s responses to GSS questions anonymous, \r\n[L3668] confidential, or both?

Does this describe the \r\n[L3679] anonymous or the confidential screening? Why?\r\n[L3680] 115.* The Willowbrook hepatitis studies In the 1960s, \r\n[L3681] children entering the Willowbrook State School, an \r\n[L3682] institution for the mentally retarded, were \r\n[L3683] deliberately infected with hepatitis. The researchers \r\n[L3684] argued that almost all children in the institution \r\n[L3685] quickly became infected anyway. The studies \r\n[L3686] showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis \r\n[L3687] existed. This finding contributed to the development \r\n[L3688] of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, \r\n[L3689] the Willowbrook studies are now considered an \r\n[L3690] example of unethical research. Explain why, \r\n[L3691] according to current ethical standards, useful results \r\n[L3692] are not enough to allow a study.\r\n[L3693] 116.* Unequal benefits Researchers on aging proposed to \r\n[L3694] investigate the effect of supplemental health services \r\n[L3695] on the quality of life of older people. Eligible \r\n[L3696] patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to \r\n[L3697] be randomly assigned to treatment and control \r\n[L3698] groups. The treatment group would be offered \r\n[L3699] hearing aids, dentures, transportation, and other \r\n[L3700] services not available without charge to the control \r\n[L3701] group. The review board felt that providing these \r\n[L3702] services to some but not other persons in the same \r\n[L3703] institution raised ethical questions. Do you agree?\r\n[L3704] 117. Animal testing (1.1) \u201cIt is right to use animals for \r\n[L3705] medical testing if it might save human lives.\u201d The \r\n[L3706] General Social Survey asked 1152 adults to react to this \r\n[L3707] statement.

Initial public offerings (1.3) The business \r\n[L3718] magazine Forbes reports that 4567 companies sold \r\n[L3719] their first stock to the public between 1990 and \r\n[L3720] 2000. The mean change in the stock price of these \r\n[L3721] companies since the first stock was issued was \r\n[L3722] +111%. The median change was \u221231%.58 Explain \r\n[L3723] how this could happen.

Ontario Health Survey The Ministry of Health in \r\n[L3757] the province of Ontario, Canada, wants to know whether \r\n[L3758] the national health care system is achieving its goals in the \r\n[L3759] province. Much information about health care comes from \r\n[L3760] patient records, but that source doesn\u2019t allow us to compare \r\n[L3761] people who use health services with those who don\u2019t. So \r\n[L3762] the Ministry of Health conducted the Ontario Health Sur\ufffevey, which interviewed a random sample of 61,239 people \r\n[L3763] who live in the province of Ontario.59\r\n[L3764] (a) What is the population for this sample survey? \r\n[L3765] What is the sample?\r\n[L3766] (b) The survey found that 76% of males and 86% of \r\n[L3767] females in the sample had visited a general practi\ufffetioner at least once in the past year.

Polling the faculty A researcher wants to study the \r\n[L3805] attitudes of college faculty members about the work hab\ufffeits of entering freshmen. These attitudes appear to differ \r\n[L3806] depending on the type of college. The American Associa\ufffetion of University Professors classifies colleges as follows:\r\n[L3807] Class I: Offer doctorate degrees and award at least 15 \r\n[L3808] per year.\r\n[L3809] Class IIA: Award degrees above the bachelor\u2019s but are \r\n[L3810] not in Class I.\r\n[L3811] Class IIB: Award no degrees beyond the bachelor\u2019s.\r\n[L3812] Class III: Two-year colleges.\r\n[L3813] The researcher would like to survey about 200 faculty mem\ufffebers.

Are anesthetics safe? The National Halothane Study \r\n[L3831] was a major investigation of the safety of anesthetics used \r\n[L3832] in surgery. Records of over 850,000 operations performed \r\n[L3833] in 34 major hospitals showed the following death rates for \r\n[L3834] four common anesthetics:60\r\n[L3835] Anesthetic: A B C D\r\n[L3836] Death rate: 1.7% 1.7% 3.4% 1.9%\r\n[L3837] There seems to be a clear association between the anesthet\ufffeic used and the death rate of patients. Anesthetic C appears\r\n[L3838] to be dangerous.\r\n[L3839] (a) Explain why we call the National Halothane Study \r\n[L3840] an observational study rather than an experiment,\r\n[L3841] even though it compared the results of using dif\ufffeferent anesthetics in actual surgery.\r\n[L3842] (b) When the study looked at lurking variables that \r\n[L3843] are related to a doctor\u2019s choice of anesthetic, it \r\n[L3844] found that Anesthetic C was not causing extra \r\n[L3845] deaths.

Ugly fries Few people want to eat discolored \r\n[L3851] french fries. Potatoes are kept refrigerated before being \r\n[L3852] cut for french fries to prevent spoiling and preserve flavor. \r\n[L3853] But immediate processing of cold potatoes causes discol\ufffeoring due to complex chemical reactions. The potatoes \r\n[L3854] must therefore be brought to room temperature before \r\n[L3855] processing. Researchers want to design an experiment in \r\n[L3856] which tasters will rate the color and flavor of french fries \r\n[L3857] prepared from several groups of potatoes. The potatoes \r\n[L3858] will be freshly picked or stored for a month at room tem\ufffeperature or stored for a month refrigerated. They will then \r\n[L3859] be sliced and cooked either immediately or after an hour \r\n[L3860] at room temperature.

A study of treatments for angina (pain due to low \r\n[L3970] blood supply to the heart) compared bypass surgery, angio\ufffeplasty, and use of drugs. The study looked at the medical \r\n[L3971] records of thousands of angina patients whose doctors had \r\n[L3972] chosen one of these treatments. It found that the average \r\n[L3973] survival time of patients given drugs was the highest.

Which of the follow\ufffeing statements about this situation is true?\r\n[L4087] (a) Since random sampling was used, we can feel confi\ufffedent that the percent of all American high school teachers \r\n[L4088] who would say they favor a national proficiency test is close \r\n[L4089] to 32%.\r\n[L4090] (b) We cannot trust these results, because the survey was \r\n[L4091] mailed. Only survey results from face-to-face interviews are \r\n[L4092] considered valid.\r\n[L4093] (c) Because over half of those who were mailed the survey \r\n[L4094] actually responded, we can feel pretty confident that the ac\ufffetual percent of all American high school teachers who would \r\n[L4095] say they favor a national proficiency test is close to 32%.\r\n[L4096] (d) The results of this survey may be affected by nonre\ufffesponse bias.\r\n[L4097] (e) The results of this survey cannot be trusted due to vol\ufffeuntary response bias.\r\n[L4098] Section II: Free Response Show all your work.

Here are the IQ scores of 10 randomly chosen \r\n[L4262] fifth-grade students:\r\n[L4263] 145 139 126 122 125 130 96 110 118 118\r\n[L4264] Which of the following statements about this data set is \r\n[L4265] not true?\r\n[L4266] (a) The student with an IQ of 96 is considered an outlier \r\n[L4267] by the 1.5 \u00d7 IQR rule.\r\n[L4268] (b) The five-number summary of the 10 IQ scores is 96, \r\n[L4269] 118, 123.5, 130, 145.\r\n[L4270] (c) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4271] mean of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be higher than \r\n[L4272] the mean of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4273] (d) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4274] standard deviation of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be \r\n[L4275] lower than the standard deviation of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4276] (e) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4277] IQR of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be lower than the \r\n[L4278] IQR of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4279] AP1.9. Before he goes to bed each night, Mr. Kleen pours \r\n[L4280] dishwasher powder into his dishwasher and turns it on. \r\n[L4281] Each morning, Mrs. Kleen weighs the box of dishwasher \r\n[L4282] powder. From an examination of the data, she concludes \r\n[L4283] that Mr. Kleen dispenses a rather consistent amount \r\n[L4284] of powder each night. Which of the following statements \r\n[L4285] is true?\r\n[L4286] I. There is a high positive correlation between the \r\n[L4287] number of days that have passed since the box of dish\ufffewasher powder was opened and the amount of powder \r\n[L4288] left in the box.\r\n[L4289] II. A scatterplot with days since purchase as the explana\ufffetory variable and amount of dishwasher powder used as \r\n[L4290] the response variable would display a strong positive \r\n[L4291] association.\r\n[L4292] III.

You are planning an experiment to determine \r\n[L4317] the effect of the brand of gasoline and the weight of a car \r\n[L4318] on gas mileage measured in miles per gallon. You will use \r\n[L4319] a single test car, adding weights so that its total weight is \r\n[L4320] 3000, 3500, or 4000 pounds. The car will drive on a test \r\n[L4321] track at each weight using each of Amoco, Marathon, and \r\n[L4322] Speedway gasoline.

Those who advocate for monetary incentives in \r\n[L4403] a work environment claim that this type of incentive has \r\n[L4404] the greatest appeal because it allows the winners to do what \r\n[L4405] they want with their winnings.

Not only are there national brands for \r\n[L4428] most products, but many stores have their own in-house \r\n[L4429] brands. Since shelf space is not infinite, the question is \r\n[L4430] how many linear feet to allocate to each product and \r\n[L4431] which shelf (top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle) \r\n[L4432] to put it on. The middle shelf is the most popular and lu\ufffecrative, since many shoppers, if undecided, will simply \r\n[L4433] pick the product that is at eye level. \r\n[L4434] A local store that sells many upscale goods is trying to \r\n[L4435] determine how much shelf space to allocate to its own \r\n[L4436] brand of men\u2019s personal-grooming products.

By the end of the chapter, you\u2019ll be ready to interpret \r\n[L7] the results of this study.\r\n[L8] Early research showed that magnetic fields affected living tissue in humans. Some doc\ufffetors have begun to use magnets to treat patients with chronic pain. Scientists wondered \r\n[L9] whether this type of therapy really worked. They designed a study to find out.\r\n[L10] Fifty patients with chronic pain were recruited for the study. A doctor identified a painful \r\n[L11] site on each patient and asked him or her to rate the pain on a scale from 0 (mild pain) to \r\n[L12] 10 (severe pain). Then, the doctor selected a sealed envelope containing a magnet from a \r\n[L13] box that contained both active and inactive magnets. That way, neither the doctor nor the \r\n[L14] patient knew which type of magnet was being used. The chosen magnet was applied to \r\n[L15] the site of the pain for 45 minutes. After \u201ctreatment,\u201d each patient was again asked to rate \r\n[L16] the level of pain from 0 to 10.\r\n[L17] In all, 29 patients were given active magnets and 21 patients received inactive magnets. \r\n[L18] All but one of the patients rated their initial pain as an 8, 9, or 10.

Here are \r\n[L26] some examples:\r\n[L27] sThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that \r\n[L28] seat belt use in passenger vehicles increased from 83% in 2008 to 84% in 2009.2\r\n[L29] sAccording to a recent survey, U.S. teens aged 13 to 18 spend \r\n[L30] an average of 26.8 hours per week online. Although 59% of the \r\n[L31] teens said that posting personal information or photos online is \r\n[L32] unsafe, 62% said they had posted photos of themselves.3\r\n[L33] sA recent study suggests that lack of sleep increases the risk \r\n[L34] of catching a cold.4\r\n[L35] sFor their final project, two AP Statistics students showed \r\n[L36] that listening to music while studying decreased subjects\u2019 per\ufffeformance on a memory task.5\r\n[L37] Can we trust these results? As you\u2019ll learn in this chapter, that \r\n[L38] depends on how the data were produced. Let\u2019s take a closer \r\n[L39] look at where the data came from in each of these studies.\r\n[L40] Each year, the NHTSA conducts an observational study of seat belt use in \r\n[L41] vehicles. The NHTSA sends trained observers to record the actual behavior of \r\n[L42] people in vehicles at randomly selected locations across the country. The idea \r\n[L43] of an observational study is simple: you can learn a lot just by watching. Or by \r\n[L44] asking a few questions, as in the survey of teens\u2019 online habits. Harris Interactive \r\n[L45] conducted this survey using a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of 655 U.S. 13- to 18-year\ufffeolds. Both of these studies use information from a sample to draw conclusions \r\n[L46] about some larger population. Section 4.1 examines the issues involved in sam\ufffepling and surveys.\r\n[L47] In the sleep and catching a cold study, 153 volunteers took part. They answered \r\n[L48] questions about their sleep habits over a two-week period. Then, researchers gave \r\n[L49] them a virus and waited to see who developed a cold. This was a complicated \r\n[L50] observational study. Compare this with the experiment performed by the AP Statis\ufffetics students. They recruited 30 students and divided them into two groups of 15 by \r\n[L51] drawing names from a hat. Students in one group tried to memorize a list of words \r\n[L52] while listening to music. Students in the other group tried to memorize the same \r\n[L53] list of words while sitting in silence. Section 4.2 focuses on designing experiments.\r\n[L54] The goal of many statistical studies is to show that changes in one variable cause\r\n[L55] changes in another variable. In Section 4.3, we\u2019ll look at why establishing causa\ufffetion is so difficult, especially in observational studies. We\u2019ll also consider some of \r\n[L56] the ethical issues involved in planning and conducting a study.\r\n[L57] Here\u2019s an Activity that gives you a preview of what lies ahead.\r\n[L58] ACTIVITY See no evil, hear no evil?\r\n[L59] MATERIALS: Two index cards, each with 10 pairs of digits written on it (prepared by your teacher); \r\n[L60] clock, watch, or stopwatch to measure 30 seconds; and a coin for each pair of students\r\n[L61] Confucius said, \u201cI hear and I forget.

We \r\n[L109] use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population.\r\n[L110] The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. To make \r\n[L111] sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. \r\n[L112] Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this distinction and also introduces some major \r\n[L113] uses of sampling.","[L114] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bfa58ad7da25a1e#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":62546,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L115] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 75>","[L116] 208 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L117] EXAMPLE\r\n[L118] EXAMPLE Sampling Hardwood and Humans\r\n[L119] Populations and samples\r\n[L120] PROBLEM: Identify the population and the sample in each of the following settings.\r\n[L121] (a) A furniture maker buys hardwood in large batches. The supplier is supposed to dry the wood \r\n[L122] before shipping (wood that isn\u2019t dry won\u2019t hold its size and shape). The furniture maker chooses \r\n[L123] five pieces of wood from each batch and tests their moisture content. If any piece exceeds 12% \r\n[L124] moisture content, the entire batch is sent back.\r\n[L125] (b) Each week, the Gallup Poll questions a sample of about 1500 adult U.S. residents to deter\ufffemine national opinion on a wide variety of issues.\r\n[L126] SOLUTION:\r\n[L127] (a) The population is all the pieces of hardwood in a batch. The sample is the five pieces of wood \r\n[L128] that are selected from that batch and tested for moisture content.\r\n[L129] (b) Gallup\u2019s population is all adult U.S. residents. Their sample is the 1500 adults who actu\ufffeally respond to the survey questions.\r\n[L130] For Practice Try Exercise 1\r\n[L131] The Idea of a Sample Survey\r\n[L132] We often draw conclusions about a whole population on the \r\n[L133] basis of a sample. Have you ever tasted a sample of ice cream \r\n[L134] and ordered a cone if the sample tastes good? Since ice \r\n[L135] cream is fairly uniform, the single taste represents the \r\n[L136] whole. Choosing a representative sample from a large and \r\n[L137] varied population (like all young U.S. drivers) is not so easy. \r\n[L138] The first step in planning a sample survey is to say exactly \r\n[L139] what population we want to describe. The second step is to say \r\n[L140] exactly what we want to measure, that is, to give exact defini\ufffetions of our variables.\r\n[L141] We reserve the term \u201csample survey\u201d for studies that use an orga\ufffenized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific popula\ufffetion, like the pieces of hardwood and the U.S. adults in the previous \r\n[L142] example. By our definition, the population in a sample survey can con\ufffesist of people, animals, or things. Some people use the terms \u201csurvey\u201d \r\n[L143] or \u201csample survey\u201d to refer only to studies in which people are asked one \r\n[L144] or more questions, like the Gallup Poll of the last example.

Let\u2019s take a closer look at some good and not-so-good sam\ufffepling methods.\r\n[L157] How to Sample Badly\r\n[L158] How can we choose a sample that we can trust to represent the population? \r\n[L159] The easiest\u2014but not the best\u2014sampling method just chooses individuals who \r\n[L160] are close by. Suppose we\u2019re interested in finding out how long students at a \r\n[L161] large high school spent on homework last week, for example. We might go to \r\n[L162] the school library and ask the first 30 students we see about their homework \r\n[L163] time. A sample selected by taking the members of the population that are \r\n[L164] easiest to reach is called a convenience sample. Convenience samples often \r\n[L165] produce unrepresentative data.\r\n[L166] other economic and social information. To measure unemployment, we must first \r\n[L167] specify the population we want to describe. The CPS defines its population as \r\n[L168] all U.S. residents (legal or not) 16 years of age and over who are civilians and are \r\n[L169] not in an institution such as a prison. The unemployment rate announced in the \r\n[L170] news refers to this specific population.\r\n[L171] What does it mean to be \u201cunemployed\u201d? Someone who is not looking for work\u2014\r\n[L172] for example, a full-time student\u2014should not be called unemployed just because \r\n[L173] she is not working for pay. If you are chosen for the CPS sample, the interviewer \r\n[L174] first asks whether you are available to work and whether you actually looked for \r\n[L175] work in the past four weeks. If not, you are neither employed nor unemployed\u2014\r\n[L176] you are not in the labor force.\r\n[L177] If you are in the labor force, the interviewer goes on to ask about employment. If \r\n[L178] you did any work for pay or in your own business during the week of the survey, \r\n[L179] you are employed. If you worked at least 15 hours in a family business without \r\n[L180] pay, you are employed. You are also employed if you have a job but didn\u2019t work \r\n[L181] because of vacation, being on strike, or other good reason. An unemployment rate \r\n[L182] of 9.7% means that 9.7% of the sample was unemployed, using the exact CPS \r\n[L183] definitions of both \u201clabor force\u201d and \u201cunemployed.\u201d\r\n[L184] DEFINITION: Convenience sample\r\n[L185] Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach results in a convenience sample.\r\n[L186] What\u2019s wrong with our convenience sample of students in the library? It\u2019s \r\n[L187] unlikely that this sample represents the homework habits of all students at the \r\n[L188] school well. In fact, we\u2019d expect the sample to overestimate the average homework \r\n[L189] time in the population since students who hang out in the library might tend to \r\n[L190] be more studious. This is bias: using a method that will consistently overestimate \r\n[L191] or underestimate the value you want to know.","[L192] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 5 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bea60ae105051c9#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_4.jpg","size_bytes":53957,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L193] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 75>","[L194] 210 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L195] EXAMPLE\r\n[L196] DEFINITION: Bias\r\n[L197] The design of a statistical study shows bias if it systematically favors certain outcomes.\r\n[L198] Convenience samples are almost guaranteed to show bias. So are voluntary \r\n[L199] response samples, in which people decide whether to join the sample in response \r\n[L200] to an open invitation. Call-in, write-in, and many Internet polls rely on voluntary \r\n[L201] response samples. Unfortunately, people who choose to participate are usually \r\n[L202] not representative of any clearly defined population. Voluntary response samples \r\n[L203] attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question, often in the same \r\n[L204] direction. That leads to bias.\r\n[L205] DEFINITION: Voluntary response sample\r\n[L206] A voluntary response sample consists of people who choose themselves by respond\ufffeing to a general appeal. Voluntary response samples show bias because people with \r\n[L207] strong opinions (often in the same direction) are most likely to respond.\r\n[L208] Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, \r\n[L209] only about 15% of the public has ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend \r\n[L210] to be the same people who call radio talk shows.

One \r\n[L214] of his shows was largely devoted to attacking a proposal to offer driver\u2019s licenses \r\n[L215] to illegal immigrants. During the show, Mr. Dobbs invited his viewers to go to \r\n[L216] loudobbs.com to vote on the question \u201cWould you be more or less likely to vote for \r\n[L217] a presidential candidate who supports giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal aliens? The \r\n[L218] result: 97% of the 7350 people who voted by the end of the show said \u201cLess likely.\u201d\r\n[L219] PROBLEM: What type of sample did Mr. Dobbs use in his poll? Explain how this sampling method \r\n[L220] could lead to bias in the poll results.\r\n[L221] SOLUTION: Mr. Dobbs used a voluntary response sample: people chose to go online and respond. \r\n[L222] Those who voted were viewers of Mr. Dobbs\u2019s program, which means that they are likely to support \r\n[L223] his views. The 97% poll result is probably an extreme overestimate of the percent of people in the \r\n[L224] population who would be less likely to support a presidential candidate with this position.\r\n[L225] AP EXAM TIP If you\u2019re asked to describe how the design of a study leads to bias, you\u2019re expected to identify \r\n[L226] the direction of the bias. Suppose you were asked, \u201cExplain how using a convenience sample of students in \r\n[L227] your statistics class to estimate the proportion of all high school students who own a graphing calculator could \r\n[L228] result in bias.\u201d You might respond, \u201cThis sample would probably include a much higher proportion of students \r\n[L229] with a graphing calculator than in the population at large because a graphing calculator is required for the \r\n[L230] statistics class.

In a conve\ufffenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice \r\n[L247] produces bias. The statistician\u2019s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose \r\n[L248] the sample. A sample chosen by chance rules out both favoritism by the sampler \r\n[L249] and self-selection by respondents. Random sampling, the use of chance to select \r\n[L250] a sample, is the central principle of statistical sampling.\r\n[L251] The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat \r\n[L252] (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of a simple\r\n[L253] random sample.\r\n[L254] DEFINITION: Simple random sample\r\n[L255] A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population \r\n[L256] chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the \r\n[L257] sample actually selected.\r\n[L258] An SRS not only gives each indi\ufffevidual an equal chance to be chosen but \r\n[L259] also gives every possible sample an equal \r\n[L260] chance to be chosen. There are other \r\n[L261] random sampling methods that give \r\n[L262] each individual, but not each sample, an \r\n[L263] equal chance. Exercise 26 describes one \r\n[L264] such method. For now, let\u2019s think about \r\n[L265] how to actually select an SRS.\r\n[L266] When you think of an SRS, picture \r\n[L267] drawing names from a hat to remind your\ufffeself that an SRS doesn\u2019t favor any part of the \r\n[L268] population. That\u2019s why an SRS is a better \r\n[L269] method of choosing samples than conve\ufffenience or voluntary response samples. But \r\n[L270] writing names on slips of paper and draw\ufffeing them from a hat doesn\u2019t work as well \r\n[L271] if the population is large.

If you don\u2019t have technology handy, you can use a table of \r\n[L280] random digits.\r\n[L281] DEFINITION: Table of random digits\r\n[L282] A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with \r\n[L283] these properties:\r\n[L284] s Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.\r\n[L285] s The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table \r\n[L286] gives no information about any other part.\r\n[L287] Table D at the back of the book is a table of random digits. It begins with the \r\n[L288] digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear \r\n[L289] in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning\u2014\r\n[L290] the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. There are two steps in using \r\n[L291] the table to choose a simple random sample.\r\n[L292] How to Choose an SRS Using Table D\r\n[L293] STEP 1: LABEL. Give each member of the population a numerical label of the \r\n[L294] same length.\r\n[L295] STEP 2: TABLE. Read consecutive groups of digits of the appropriate length \r\n[L296] from Table D.\r\n[L297] Your sample contains the individuals whose labels you find.\r\n[L298] Always use the shortest labels that will cover your population. For instance, \r\n[L299] you can label up to 100 individuals with two digits: 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. As \r\n[L300] standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as \r\n[L301] needed). Reading groups of digits from the table gives all individuals the same \r\n[L302] chance to be chosen because all labels of the same length have the same chance \r\n[L303] to be found in the table. For example, any pair of digits in the table is equally \r\n[L304] likely to be any of the 100 possible labels 01, 02, . . . , 99, 00. Ignore any group of \r\n[L305] digits that was not used as a label or that duplicates a label already in the sample. \r\n[L306] You can read digits from Table D in any order\u2014across a row, down a column, \r\n[L307] and so on\u2014because the table has no order.

What \r\n[L394] advantage(s) does random sampling provide?\r\n[L395] There\u2019s an important difference between the samples produced by the Simple\r\n[L396] Random Sample applet and the calculator\u2019s randInt command in the Technol\ufffeogy Corner. The applet sampled without replacement from the \u201cPopulation hop\ufffeper,\u201d but the calculator sampled with replacement from the specified population. \r\n[L397] As a result, the calculator sometimes selects the same number more than once in \r\n[L398] a given sample. To deal with this problem, you can generate additional random \r\n[L399] numbers as needed to replace any repeats. Or you can use a method other than \r\n[L400] randInt (like randSamp on the TI-Nspire) to sample without replacement. Refer \r\n[L401] to your device\u2019s reference manual or ask your teacher.\r\n[L402] We can trust results from an SRS, as well as from other types of random samples \r\n[L403] that we will meet later, because the use of impersonal chance avoids bias. Online\r\n[L404] and call-in polls also produce samples. But we can\u2019t trust results from these sam\ufffeples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. The first question to ask about \r\n[L405] any sample is whether it was chosen at random.\r\n[L406] Other Sampling Methods\r\n[L407] The basic idea of sampling is straightforward: take an SRS from the population \r\n[L408] and use your sample results to gain information about the population. Unfor\ufffetunately, it\u2019s usually very difficult to actually get an SRS from the population of \r\n[L409] interest. Imagine trying to get a simple random sample of all the batteries pro\ufffeduced in one day at a factory. Or an SRS of all U.S. high school students. In either \r\n[L410] case, it\u2019s just not practical to choose an SRS. For starters, it would be difficult to \r\n[L411] obtain an accurate list of the population from which to draw the sample. It would \r\n[L412] also be very time-consuming to collect data from each individual that\u2019s randomly \r\n[L413] selected. Sometimes, there are also statistical advantages to using more complex \r\n[L414] sampling methods.","[L415] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 11 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://10ecedd5bee1a96#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_10.jpg","size_bytes":60902,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L416] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 75>","[L417] 216 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L418] One of the most common alternatives to an SRS involves sampling important \r\n[L419] groups (called strata) within the population separately. Then these separate \u201csub\ufffesamples\u201d are combined to form one stratified random sample. This method \r\n[L420] works best when the individuals within each stratum are similar to one another \r\n[L421] in a way that affects the variable being measured but there are large differences \r\n[L422] between strata.\r\n[L423] DEFINITION: Stratified random sample and strata\r\n[L424] To select a stratified random sample, first classify the population into groups of similar \r\n[L425] individuals, called strata. Then choose a separate SRS in each stratum and combine \r\n[L426] these SRSs to form the full sample.\r\n[L427] Choose the strata based on facts known before the sample is taken. For example, \r\n[L428] in a study of sleep habits on school nights, the population of students in a large \r\n[L429] high school might be divided into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior stra\ufffeta. In a preelection poll, a population of election districts might be divided into \r\n[L430] urban, suburban, and rural strata. If the individuals in each stratum are less varied \r\n[L431] than the population as a whole, a stratified random sample can produce better in\ufffeformation about the population than an SRS of the same size. Not convinced? Try \r\n[L432] the following Activity.\r\n[L433] ACTIVITY Sampling sunflowers\r\n[L434] A British farmer grows sunflowers for making sunflower oil. Her field is arranged in a grid pat\ufffetern, with 10 rows and 10 columns as shown in the figure. Irrigation ditches run along the top \r\n[L435] and bottom of the field, as shown. The farmer would like to estimate \r\n[L436] the number of healthy plants in the field so she can project how much \r\n[L437] money she\u2019ll make from selling them. It would take too much time to \r\n[L438] count the plants in all 100 squares, so she\u2019ll accept an estimate based on \r\n[L439] a sample of 10 squares.\r\n[L440] 1. Use Table D or technology to take a simple random sample of 10 \r\n[L441] grid squares. Record the location (for example, B6) of each square you \r\n[L442] select.\r\n[L443] 2. This time, you\u2019ll take a stratified random sample using the \r\n[L444] rows as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select \r\n[L445] one square from each (horizontal) row. Record the location of \r\n[L446] each square.\r\n[L447] 3. Now, take a stratified random sample using the columns\r\n[L448] as strata. Use Table D or technology to randomly select one \r\n[L449] square from each (vertical) column. Record the location of \r\n[L450] each square.\r\n[L451] 4. The table on page N/DS-6 gives the actual number of \r\n[L452] sunflowers in each grid square.

Your teacher will provide you with the mean number of sunflowers in the popu\ufffelation of all 100 grid squares in the field. How did the three sampling methods do?\r\n[L472] The following example describes an interesting use of stratified random samples \r\n[L473] in the music business.\r\n[L474] Who Wrote That Song?\r\n[L475] Using a stratified random sample\r\n[L476] A radio station that broadcasts a piece of music owes a royalty to the composer. \r\n[L477] The organization of composers (called ASCAP) collects these royalties for all its \r\n[L478] members by charging stations a license fee for the right to play members\u2019 songs. \r\n[L479] ASCAP has four million songs in its catalog and collects $435 million in fees each \r\n[L480] year. How should ASCAP distribute this income among its members? By sam\ufffepling: ASCAP tapes about 60,000 hours from the 53 million hours of local radio \r\n[L481] programs across the country each year.\r\n[L482] Radio stations are stratified by type of community (metropolitan, rural), geographic \r\n[L483] location (New England, Pacific, etc.), and the size of the license fee paid to \r\n[L484] ASCAP, which reflects the size of the audience. In all, there are 432 strata. Tapes \r\n[L485] are made at random hours of randomly selected members of each stratum. The \r\n[L486] tapes are reviewed by experts who can recognize almost every piece of music ever \r\n[L487] written, and the composers are then paid according to their popularity.7\r\n[L488] Although a stratified random sample can sometimes give more precise infor\ufffemation about a population than an SRS, both sampling methods are hard to use \r\n[L489] when populations are large and spread out over a wide area. In that situation, we\u2019d \r\n[L490] prefer a method that selects groups of individuals that are \u201cnear\u201d one another. \r\n[L491] That\u2019s the idea of a cluster sample.\r\n[L492] DEFINITION: Cluster sample and clusters\r\n[L493] To take a cluster sample, first divide the population into smaller groups. Ideally, these \r\n[L494] clusters should mirror the characteristics of the population. Then choose an SRS of the \r\n[L495] clusters. All individuals in the chosen clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L496] Imagine a large high school that assigns its students to homerooms alphabeti\ufffecally by last name. The school administration is considering a new schedule and \r\n[L497] would like student input. Administrators decide to survey 200 randomly selected \r\n[L498] students.

They don\u2019t offer the statistical advantage of better information about the \r\n[L507] population that stratified random samples do. That\u2019s because clusters are often \r\n[L508] chosen for ease or convenience, so they may have as much variability as the popu\ufffelation itself. Be sure you understand the difference between strata and clusters. \r\n[L509] We want each stratum to contain similar individuals, and for there to be large \r\n[L510] differences between strata. For a cluster sample, we\u2019d like each cluster to look just \r\n[L511] like the population, but on a smaller scale.\r\n[L512] Sampling at a School Assembly\r\n[L513] Strata or clusters?\r\n[L514] The student council wants to conduct a survey during the first \r\n[L515] five minutes of an all-school assembly in the auditorium about \r\n[L516] use of the school library.

Since students\u2019 library use might be \r\n[L619] similar within grade levels but different across grade levels, we\u2019ll use the grade level seating areas \r\n[L620] as our strata. Within each grade\u2019s seating area, we\u2019ll select 20 seats at random. For the 9th grade, \r\n[L621] use randInt(601,800) to select 20 seats. Use randInt(401,600) to pick 20 sophomore seats, \r\n[L622] randInt(201,400) to get 20 junior seats, and randInt(1,200) to choose 20 senior seats. Give the \r\n[L623] survey to the students in the selected seats.\r\n[L624] (c) With the way students are seated, each column of seats from the stage to the back of the \r\n[L625] auditorium could be used as a cluster. Note that each cluster contains students from all four grade \r\n[L626] levels, so each should represent the population well. Since there are 20 clusters, each with 40 seats, \r\n[L627] we need to choose 2 clusters at random to get 80 students for the survey. Use randInt(1,20) to \r\n[L628] select two clusters, and then give the survey to all 40 students in each column of seats.\r\n[L629] Most large-scale sample surveys use multistage samples that combine two or \r\n[L630] more sampling methods. For example, the Current Population Survey\u2019s monthly \r\n[L631] survey of 60,000 households uses the following design:\r\n[L632] Stage 1: Divide the United States into 2007 geographical areas called Primary \r\n[L633] Sampling Units, or PSUs. Select a sample of 756 PSUs. This sample includes \r\n[L634] the 428 PSUs with the largest population and a stratified random sample of 328 \r\n[L635] of the others.\r\n[L636] Stage 2: Divide each PSU selected into smaller areas called \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d \r\n[L637] Stratify the neighborhoods using ethnic and other information, and take a strati\ufffefied random sample of the neighborhoods in each PSU.\r\n[L638] Stage 3: Sort the housing units in each neighborhood into clusters of four nearby \r\n[L639] units. Interview the households in a random sample of these clusters.\r\n[L640] Analyzing data from sampling methods more complex than an SRS takes us \r\n[L641] beyond basic statistics.

The \r\n[L666] process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of sample data is \r\n[L667] called inference because we infer information about the population from what \r\n[L668] we know about the sample. Inference from convenience samples or voluntary \r\n[L669] response samples would be misleading because these methods of choosing a sam\ufffeple are biased. We are almost certain that the sample does not fairly represent \r\n[L670] the population. The first reason to rely on random sampling is to eliminate bias in \r\n[L671] selecting samples from the list of available individuals.\r\n[L672] Still, it is unlikely that results from a random sample are exactly the same as for \r\n[L673] the entire population. Sample results, like the unemployment rate obtained from \r\n[L674] the monthly Current Population Survey, are only estimates of the truth about the \r\n[L675] population. If we select two samples at random from the same population, we will \r\n[L676] almost certainly choose different individuals. So the sample results will differ some\ufffewhat, just by chance. Properly designed samples avoid systematic bias. But their re\ufffesults are rarely exactly correct, and we expect them to vary from sample to sample.\r\n[L677] Inference\r\n[L678] ACTIVITY Results may vary . . .\r\n[L679] MATERIALS: At least 200 colored chips with exactly 60% of a particular color (say, red); large bag or \r\n[L680] other container that students can\u2019t see through\r\n[L681] In this Activity, you will explore how the results of repeated random samples vary \r\n[L682] in relation to the population truth.\r\n[L683] 1. Your teacher will prepare a large population of colored chips with 60% of a \r\n[L684] particular color.\r\n[L685] 2. One at a time, each student in the class will take an SRS of 20 chips and \r\n[L686] record the proportion of chips obtained that are red. The chips should be \r\n[L687] returned to the container before the next student chooses a sample.\r\n[L688] 3. Make a class dotplot of the sample proportions for this color of chip. Where \r\n[L689] is the graph centered? How much do the sample proportions vary around the \r\n[L690] center? Is there a clear shape?\r\n[L691] Why can we trust random samples? As the previous Activity illustrates, the \r\n[L692] results of random sampling don\u2019t change haphazardly from sample to sample. \r\n[L693] Because we deliberately use chance, the results obey the laws of probability that \r\n[L694] govern chance behavior. These laws allow us to say how likely it is that sample \r\n[L695] results are close to the truth about the population. The second reason to use \r\n[L696] random sampling is that the laws of probability allow trustworthy inference about \r\n[L697] the population. Results from random samples come with a margin of error that \r\n[L698] sets bounds on the size of the likely error. We will discuss the details of inference \r\n[L699] for sampling later.\r\n[L700] One point is worth making now: larger random samples give better informa\ufffetion about the population than smaller samples. For instance, in the Activity, \r\n[L701] you would get a better estimate of the proportion of red chips in the popula\ufffeMargin of error","[L702] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 16 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://136106c58c36cbc#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_15.jpg","size_bytes":54135,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L703] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>","[L704] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 221\r\n[L705] tion using random samples of 40 chips than 20 chips. By taking a very large \r\n[L706] sample, you can be confident that the sample result is very close to the truth \r\n[L707] about the population.\r\n[L708] The Current Population Survey contacts about 60,000 households, so we\u2019d \r\n[L709] expect its estimate of the national unemployment rate to be within about 0.1% \r\n[L710] of the actual population value. Opinion polls that contact 1000 or 1500 peo\ufffeple give less precise results\u2014we expect the sample result to be within about \r\n[L711] 3% of the actual population percent with a given opinion. Of course, only \r\n[L712] samples chosen by chance carry this guarantee. Lou Dobbs\u2019s online sample \r\n[L713] tells us little about overall American public opinion even though 7350 people \r\n[L714] clicked a response.\r\n[L715] Sample Surveys: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L716] Random sampling eliminates bias in choosing a sample. But even a large ran\ufffedom sample will give a result that differs from the truth about the population. \r\n[L717] This \u201csampling variability\u201d is described by the margin of error that comes with \r\n[L718] most poll results. So once we see the magic words randomly selected, do we \r\n[L719] know we have trustworthy information? It certainly beats voluntary response, \r\n[L720] but not always by as much as we might hope. Sampling in the real world is \r\n[L721] more complex and less reliable than choosing an SRS from a list of names in \r\n[L722] a textbook exercise.\r\n[L723] Most sample surveys are affected by errors in addition to sampling variabil\ufffeity. These errors can introduce bias that makes a survey result meaningless. \r\n[L724] Good sampling technique includes the art of reducing all sources of error. \r\n[L725] Let\u2019s look at the two main sources of errors in sample surveys: sampling errors \r\n[L726] and nonsampling errors.\r\n[L727] Sampling errors The margin of error tells us how much sampling variability to \r\n[L728] expect, and we can control it by choosing the size of our random sample. It doesn\u2019t \r\n[L729] tell us about sampling errors, mistakes made in the process of taking a sample that \r\n[L730] could lead to inaccurate information about the population. One source of sam\ufffepling error is the use of bad sampling methods, such as voluntary response. We \r\n[L731] can avoid bad methods. Other sampling errors are not so easy to handle. Sampling \r\n[L732] often begins with a list of individuals from which we will draw our sample. This \r\n[L733] list is called the sampling frame. Ideally, the sampling frame should list every \r\n[L734] individual in the population. Because a list of the entire population is rarely avail\ufffeable, most samples suffer from some degree of undercoverage.\r\n[L735] DEFINITION: Undercoverage\r\n[L736] Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process \r\n[L737] of choosing the sample.\r\n[L738] A sample survey of households, for example, will miss not only homeless peo\ufffeple but prison inmates and students in dormitories. An opinion poll conducted \r\n[L739] by calling landline telephone numbers will miss households that have only cell \r\n[L740] phones as well as households without a phone. The results of national sample \r\n[L741] surveys therefore have some bias due to undercoverage if the people not covered \r\n[L742] differ systematically from the rest of the population.\r\n[L743] Sampling frame","[L744] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://e440a18994d81bf#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_16.jpg","size_bytes":58104,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L745] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>","[L746] 222 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L747] EXAMPLE\r\n[L748] Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real \r\n[L749] problems start when someone picks up (or doesn\u2019t pick up) the phone. Now non\ufffesampling errors take over.\r\n[L750] Nonsampling errors Nonsampling errors are those that can plague even a census. \r\n[L751] One of the most serious sources of bias in sample surveys is nonresponse, which \r\n[L752] occurs when a selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to cooperate. \r\n[L753] Nonresponse to sample surveys often exceeds 50%, even with careful planning and \r\n[L754] several callbacks. Because nonresponse is higher in urban areas, most sample sur\ufffeveys substitute other people in the same area to avoid favoring rural areas in the \r\n[L755] final sample. If the people contacted differ from those who are rarely at home or \r\n[L756] who refuse to answer questions, some bias remains. For example, retired people \r\n[L757] may be more likely to respond, which would give their opinions more weight. In \r\n[L758] a poll about Social Security reform, this could give a misleading impression of the \r\n[L759] population\u2019s views.\r\n[L760] DEFINITION: Nonresponse\r\n[L761] Nonresponse occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can\u2019t be contacted or \r\n[L762] refuses to participate.\r\n[L763] Some students misuse the term \u201cvoluntary response\u201d to explain why cer\ufffetain individuals don\u2019t respond in a sample survey. Their idea is that par\ufffeticipation in the survey is optional (voluntary), so anyone can refuse to \r\n[L764] take part. What the students are actually describing is nonresponse. Think about \r\n[L765] it this way: nonresponse can occur only after a sample has been selected. In a \r\n[L766] voluntary response sample, every individual has opted to take part, so there won\u2019t \r\n[L767] be any nonresponse.\r\n[L768] The ACS, GSS, and Opinion Polls\r\n[L769] How bad is nonresponse?\r\n[L770] The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS) has the lowest nonre\ufffesponse rate of any poll we know: only about 1% of the households in the sample \r\n[L771] refuse to respond. The overall nonresponse rate, including \u201cnever at home\u201d and \r\n[L772] other causes, is just 2.5%.8 This monthly survey of about 250,000 households \r\n[L773] replaces the \u201clong form\u201d that in the past was sent to some households in the every\ufffeten-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the Census \r\n[L774] Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household doesn\u2019t return \r\n[L775] the mail questionnaire.\r\n[L776] The University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey (GSS) is the nation\u2019s most \r\n[L777] important social science survey (see Figure 4.2). The GSS contacts its sample \r\n[L778] in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its most recent \r\n[L779] survey had a 30% rate of nonresponse.","[L780] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 18 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://8bd60a84f78349d#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_17.jpg","size_bytes":49674,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L781] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 19 / 75>","[L782] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 223\r\n[L783] FIGURE 4.2 The home page of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National \r\n[L784] Opinion Research Center. The GSS has tracked opinions about a wide variety of issues since 1972.\r\n[L785] What about opinion polls by news media and opinion-polling firms? We \r\n[L786] don\u2019t know their rates of nonresponse because they won\u2019t say. That\u2019s a bad \r\n[L787] sign. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press imitated a care\ufffeful random digit dialing survey and published the results: over 5 days, the \r\n[L788] survey reached 76% of the households in its chosen sample, but \u201cbecause of \r\n[L789] busy schedules, skepticism and outright refusals, interviews were completed \r\n[L790] in just 38% of households that were reached.\u201d Combining households that \r\n[L791] could not be contacted with those who did not complete the interview gave \r\n[L792] a nonresponse rate of 73%.9\r\n[L793] Another type of nonsampling error occurs when someone gives an incorrect \r\n[L794] response. A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey leads \r\n[L795] to response bias. People know that they should take the trouble to vote, for \r\n[L796] example, so many who didn\u2019t vote in the last election will tell an interviewer \r\n[L797] that they did. The race or gender of the interviewer can influence responses to \r\n[L798] questions about race relations or attitudes toward feminism. Answers to ques\ufffetions that ask people to recall past events are often inaccurate because of faulty \r\n[L799] memory. \u201cHave you visited a dentist in the last 6 months?\u201d will often draw a \r\n[L800] \u201cYes\u201d from someone who last visited a dentist 8 months ago.10 Careful training \r\n[L801] of interviewers and careful supervision to avoid variation among the interview\ufffeers can reduce response bias.

Even the order in \r\n[L810] which questions are asked matters.\r\n[L811] How Do Americans Feel about Illegal Immigrants?\r\n[L812] Question wording matters\r\n[L813] \u201cShould illegal immigrants be prosecuted and deported for being in the U.S. illegally, \r\n[L814] or shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Asked this question in an opinion poll, 69% favored deportation. \r\n[L815] But when the very same sample was asked whether illegal immigrants who have \r\n[L816] worked in the United States for two years \u201cshould be given a chance to keep their jobs \r\n[L817] and eventually apply for legal status,\u201d 62% said that they should. Different questions \r\n[L818] give quite different impressions of attitudes toward illegal immigrants.\r\n[L819] Don\u2019t trust the results of a sample survey until you have read the exact questions \r\n[L820] asked. The amount of nonresponse and the date of the survey are also impor\ufffetant. Good statistical design is a part, but only a part, of a trustworthy survey.\r\n[L821] Does the order matter? Ask a sample of college students these two questions:\r\n[L822] \u201cHow happy are you with your life in general?\u201d (Answers on a scale of 1 to 5)\r\n[L823] \u201cHow many dates did you have last month?\u201d\r\n[L824] There is almost no association between responses to the two questions when asked \r\n[L825] in this order. It appears that dating has little to do with happiness. Reverse the order \r\n[L826] of the questions, however, and a much stronger association appears: college students \r\n[L827] who say they had more dates tend to give higher ratings of happiness about life. Asking \r\n[L828] a question that brings dating to mind makes dating success a big factor in happiness.\r\n[L829] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L830] 1.

It is important to specify exactly what \r\n[L853] population you are interested in and what variables you will measure.\r\n[L854] s Random sampling uses chance to select a sample.\r\n[L855] s The basic random sampling method is a simple random sample (SRS).\r\n[L856] An SRS gives every possible sample of a given size the same chance to be \r\n[L857] chosen. Choose an SRS by labeling the members of the population and \r\n[L858] using random digits to select the sample. Technology can automate this \r\n[L859] process.\r\n[L860] s To choose a stratified random sample, divide the population into strata,\r\n[L861] groups of individuals that are similar in some way that might affect their \r\n[L862] responses. Then choose a separate SRS from each stratum.\r\n[L863] s To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into groups, or clusters.\r\n[L864] Randomly select some of these clusters. All the individuals in the chosen \r\n[L865] clusters are included in the sample.\r\n[L866] s Failure to use random sampling often results in bias, or systematic errors in \r\n[L867] the way the sample represents the population.

Random \r\n[L872] sampling error and undercoverage are common types of sampling error. \r\n[L873] Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population are left out of \r\n[L874] the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is actually chosen.\r\n[L875] s The most serious errors in most careful surveys, however, are nonsampling\r\n[L876] errors.

The July 13, 2008, \r\n[L940] issue of Parade reported the results: 2407 \r\n[L941] (85%) said \u201cYes\u201d and 410 (15%) said \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n[L942] (a) What type of sample did the Parade survey \r\n[L943] obtain?\r\n[L944] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n[L945] 85% probably higher or lower than the true percent \r\n[L946] of all adults who believe that cell phone use while \r\n[L947] driving should be banned? Why?\r\n[L948] 9. Sleepless nights How much sleep do high school \r\n[L949] students get on a typical school night? An interested \r\n[L950] student designed a survey to find out. To make data \r\n[L951] collection easier, the student surveyed the first 100 \r\n[L952] students to arrive at school on a particular morning. \r\n[L953] These students reported an average of 7.2 hours of \r\n[L954] sleep on the previous night.\r\n[L955] (a) What type of sample did the student obtain?\r\n[L956] (b) Explain why this sampling method is biased. Is \r\n[L957] 7.2 hours probably higher or lower than the true aver\ufffeage amount of sleep last night for all students at the \r\n[L958] school? Why?\r\n[L959] 10. Sampling at the mall You have probably seen the \r\n[L960] mall interviewer, approaching people passing by with \r\n[L961] clipboard in hand. Explain why even a large sample \r\n[L962] of mall shoppers would not provide a trustworthy \r\n[L963] estimate of the current unemployment rate.\r\n[L964] 11. Do you trust the Internet? You want to ask a sample \r\n[L965] of high school students the question \u201cHow much do \r\n[L966] you trust information about health that you find on \r\n[L967] the Internet\u2014a great deal, somewhat, not much, or \r\n[L968] not at all?\u201d You try out this and other questions on a \r\n[L969] pilot group of 5 students chosen from your class. The \r\n[L970] class members are listed at top right.\r\n[L971] (a) Explain how you would use a line of Table D to \r\n[L972] choose an SRS of 5 students from the following list. \r\n[L973] Explain your method clearly enough for a classmate \r\n[L974] to obtain your results.\r\n[L975] pg 208\r\n[L976] pg 210\r\n[L977] pg 213\r\n[L978] SECTION 4.1 Exercises\r\n[L979] www","[L980] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 22 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6ed199a819f4209#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_21.jpg","size_bytes":69624,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L981] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 75>","[L982] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 227\r\n[L983] (b) Use line 107 to select the sample.

Sampling the forest To gather data on a 1200-acre \r\n[L1013] pine forest in Louisiana, the U.S. Forest Service laid a \r\n[L1014] grid of 1410 equally spaced circular plots over a map \r\n[L1015] of the forest. A ground survey visited a sample of 10% \r\n[L1016] of these plots.12\r\n[L1017] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table D \r\n[L1018] to choose an SRS of 141 plots. Your description should \r\n[L1019] be clear enough for a classmate to obtain your results.\r\n[L1020] (b) Use your method from (a) to choose the first \r\n[L1021] 3 plots.\r\n[L1022] 14. Sampling gravestones The local genealogical society \r\n[L1023] in Coles County, Illinois, has compiled records on all \r\n[L1024] 55,914 gravestones in cemeteries in the county for the \r\n[L1025] years 1825 to 1985. Historians plan to use these records \r\n[L1026] to learn about African Americans in Coles County\u2019s his\ufffetory. They first choose an SRS of 395 records to check \r\n[L1027] their accuracy by visiting the actual gravestones.13\r\n[L1028] (a) Explain how you would use technology or Table \r\n[L1029] D to choose the SRS. Your description should be \r\n[L1030] clear enough for a classmate to obtain your results.\r\n[L1031] (b) Use your method from (a) to choose the first \r\n[L1032] 3 gravestones.\r\n[L1033] 15. Random digits In using Table D repeatedly to \r\n[L1034] choose random samples, you should not always begin \r\n[L1035] at the same place, such as line 101. Why not?\r\n[L1036] 16. Random digits Which of the following statements \r\n[L1037] are true of a table of random digits, and which are \r\n[L1038] false? Briefly explain your answers.\r\n[L1039] (a) There are exactly four 0s in each row of 40 digits.\r\n[L1040] (b) Each pair of digits has chance 1/100 of being 00.\r\n[L1041] (c) The digits 0000 can never appear as a group, \r\n[L1042] because this pattern is not random.\r\n[L1043] 17. iPhones Suppose 1000 iPhones are produced at a \r\n[L1044] factory today. Management would like to ensure \r\n[L1045] that the phones\u2019 display screens meet their quality \r\n[L1046] standards before shipping them to retail stores. Since \r\n[L1047] it takes about 10 minutes to inspect an individual \r\n[L1048] phone\u2019s display screen, managers decide to inspect a \r\n[L1049] sample of 20 phones from the day\u2019s production.\r\n[L1050] (a) Explain why it would be difficult for managers to \r\n[L1051] inspect an SRS of 20 iPhones that are produced today.\r\n[L1052] (b) An eager employee suggests that it would be easy \r\n[L1053] to inspect the last 20 iPhones that were produced \r\n[L1054] today. Why isn\u2019t this a good idea?\r\n[L1055] (c) Another employee recommends inspecting every \r\n[L1056] fiftieth iPhone that is produced. Explain carefully \r\n[L1057] why this sampling method is not an SRS.\r\n[L1058] 18. Dead trees On the west side of Rocky Mountain \r\n[L1059] National Park, many mature pine trees are dying due \r\n[L1060] to infestation by pine beetles. Scientists would like to \r\n[L1061] use sampling to estimate the proportion of all pine \r\n[L1062] trees in the area that have been infected.\r\n[L1063] (a) Explain why it wouldn\u2019t be practical for scientists \r\n[L1064] to obtain an SRS in this setting.\r\n[L1065] (b) A possible alternative would be to use every pine \r\n[L1066] tree along the park\u2019s main road as a sample. Why is \r\n[L1067] this sampling method biased?\r\n[L1068] (c) Suppose that a more complicated random sam\ufffepling plan is carried out, and that 35% of the pine trees \r\n[L1069] in the sample are infested by the pine beetle. Can \r\n[L1070] scientists conclude that 35% of all the pine trees on the \r\n[L1071] west side of the park are infested? Why or why not?\r\n[L1072] 19. Who goes to the convention? A club has 30 student \r\n[L1073] members and 10 faculty members. The students are\r\n[L1074] Abel Fisher Huber Miranda Reinmann\r\n[L1075] Carson Ghosh Jimenez Moskowitz Santos\r\n[L1076] Chen Griswold Jones Neyman Shaw\r\n[L1077] David Hein Kim O\u2019Brien Thompson\r\n[L1078] Deming Hernandez Klotz Pearl Utts\r\n[L1079] Elashoff Holland Liu Potter Varga\r\n[L1080] The faculty members are\r\n[L1081] Andrews Fernandez Kim Moore West\r\n[L1082] Besicovitch Gupta Lightman Phillips Yang","[L1083] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>","[L1084] 228 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1085] The club can send 4 students and 2 faculty members \r\n[L1086] to a convention. It decides to choose those who will \r\n[L1087] go by random selection. How will you label the two \r\n[L1088] strata? Use Table D, beginning at line 123, to choose \r\n[L1089] a stratified random sample of 4 students and 2 faculty \r\n[L1090] members.\r\n[L1091] 20. Sampling by accountants Accountants often use \r\n[L1092] stratified samples during audits to verify a company\u2019s \r\n[L1093] records of such things as accounts receivable. The \r\n[L1094] stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item \r\n[L1095] and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. \r\n[L1096] One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of \r\n[L1097] these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in \r\n[L1098] amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remain\ufffeing 4400 are in amounts under $1000. Using these \r\n[L1099] groups as strata, you decide to verify all the largest \r\n[L1100] accounts and to sample 5% of the midsize accounts \r\n[L1101] and 1% of the small accounts. How would you label \r\n[L1102] the two strata from which you will sample? Use Table \r\n[L1103] D, starting at line 115, to select only the first 3 \r\n[L1104] accounts from each of these strata.\r\n[L1105] 21. Go Blue! Michigan Stadium, also known as \u201cThe Big \r\n[L1106] House,\u201d seats over 100,000 fans for a football game. \r\n[L1107] The University of Michigan athletic department plans \r\n[L1108] to conduct a survey about concessions that are sold \r\n[L1109] during games. Tickets are most expensive for seats \r\n[L1110] near the field and on the sideline. The cheapest seats \r\n[L1111] are high up in the end zones (where one of the au\ufffethors sat as a student). A map of the stadium is shown.\r\n[L1112] Visitor Sideline\r\n[L1113] Michigan Sideline\r\n[L1114] Sideline PRESS BOX ENDZONE\r\n[L1115] ENDZONE\r\n[L1116] 41 42 40\r\n[L1117] 39\r\n[L1118] 43 44 1 2 3 4 5 6\r\n[L1119] 7\r\n[L1120] 27 26 28\r\n[L1121] 29\r\n[L1122] 25\r\n[L1123] 35\r\n[L1124] 34\r\n[L1125] 33\r\n[L1126] 32\r\n[L1127] 31\r\n[L1128] 30\r\n[L1129] 36\r\n[L1130] 37\r\n[L1131] 38\r\n[L1132] 11\r\n[L1133] 12\r\n[L1134] 13\r\n[L1135] 14\r\n[L1136] 15\r\n[L1137] 16\r\n[L1138] 10\r\n[L1139] 9\r\n[L1140] 8\r\n[L1141] 24 23 22 21 20 19 18\r\n[L1142] 17\r\n[L1143] Corner\r\n[L1144] Endzone\r\n[L1145] (a) The athletic department is considering a stratified \r\n[L1146] random sample. What would you recommend as the \r\n[L1147] strata? Why?\r\n[L1148] (b) Explain why a cluster sample might be easier to \r\n[L1149] obtain. What would you recommend for the clusters? \r\n[L1150] Why?\r\n[L1151] 22. How was your stay? A hotel has 30 floors with 40 \r\n[L1152] rooms per floor. The rooms on one side of the hotel \r\n[L1153] face the water, while rooms on the other side face a \r\n[L1154] golf course. There is an extra charge for the rooms \r\n[L1155] with a water view. The hotel manager wants to survey \r\n[L1156] 120 guests who stayed at the hotel during a convention \r\n[L1157] about their overall satisfaction with the property.\r\n[L1158] (a) Explain why choosing a stratified random sample \r\n[L1159] might be preferable to an SRS in this case. What \r\n[L1160] would you use as strata?\r\n[L1161] (b) Why might a cluster sample be a simpler option? \r\n[L1162] What would you use as clusters?\r\n[L1163] 23. Is it an SRS? A corporation employs 2000 male and \r\n[L1164] 500 female engineers. A stratified random sample of \r\n[L1165] 200 male and 50 female engineers gives each engi\ufffeneer 1 chance in 10 to be chosen. This sample design \r\n[L1166] gives every individual in the population the same \r\n[L1167] chance to be chosen for the sample. Is it an SRS? \r\n[L1168] Explain your answer.\r\n[L1169] 24. Attitudes toward alcohol At a party there are 30 \r\n[L1170] students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You \r\n[L1171] choose at random 3 of those over 21 and separately \r\n[L1172] choose at random 2 of those under 21 to interview \r\n[L1173] about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every \r\n[L1174] student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: \r\n[L1175] what is the chance? Why is your sample not an SRS?\r\n[L1176] 25. High-speed Internet Laying fiber-optic cable is \r\n[L1177] expensive. Cable companies want to make sure that, \r\n[L1178] if they extend their lines out to less dense suburban \r\n[L1179] or rural areas, there will be sufficient demand and the \r\n[L1180] work will be cost-effective. They decide to conduct a \r\n[L1181] survey to determine the proportion of households in \r\n[L1182] a rural subdivision that would buy the service. They \r\n[L1183] select a sample of 5 blocks in the subdivision and \r\n[L1184] survey each family that lives on those blocks.\r\n[L1185] (a) What is the name for this kind of sampling \r\n[L1186] method?\r\n[L1187] (b) Suppose there are 65 blocks in the subdivision. \r\n[L1188] Use technology or Table D to select 5 blocks to be \r\n[L1189] sampled. Explain your method clearly.\r\n[L1190] 26. Systematic random sample Sample surveys often \r\n[L1191] use a systematic random sample to choose a sample \r\n[L1192] of apartments in a large building or housing units in \r\n[L1193] a block at the last stage of a multistage sample. Here \r\n[L1194] is a description of how to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1195] sample.\r\n[L1196] Suppose that we must choose 4 addresses out of \r\n[L1197] 100. Because 100/4 = 25, we can think of the list \r\n[L1198] as four lists of 25 addresses. Choose 1 of the first 25 \r\n[L1199] addresses at random using Table D. The sample \r\n[L1200] contains this address and the addresses 25, 50, and 75 \r\n[L1201] places down the list from it. If the table gives 13, for \r\n[L1202] example, then the systematic random sample consists \r\n[L1203] of the addresses numbered 13, 38, 63, and 88.\r\n[L1204] pg 218","[L1205] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 24 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ceaf05fda0a604f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_23.jpg","size_bytes":69254,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1206] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 25 / 75>","[L1207] Section 4.1 Sampling and Surveys 229\r\n[L1208] (a) Use Table D to choose a systematic random \r\n[L1209] sample of 5 addresses from a list of 200. Enter the \r\n[L1210] table at line 120.\r\n[L1211] (b) Like an SRS, a systematic random sample gives \r\n[L1212] all individuals the same chance to be chosen. Explain \r\n[L1213] why this is true. Then explain carefully why a system\ufffeatic sample is not an SRS.\r\n[L1214] 27. Sampling frame Ideally, the sampling frame in a \r\n[L1215] sample survey should list every individual in the \r\n[L1216] population, but in practice, this is often difficult. \r\n[L1217] Suppose that a sample of households in a community \r\n[L1218] is selected at random from the telephone directory. \r\n[L1219] Explain how this sampling method results in under\ufffecoverage that could lead to bias.\r\n[L1220] 28. Sampling frame Refer to the previous exercise. It is \r\n[L1221] more common in telephone surveys to use random \r\n[L1222] digit dialing equipment that selects the last four digits \r\n[L1223] of a telephone number at random after being given \r\n[L1224] the exchange (the first three digits). Explain how this \r\n[L1225] sampling method results in undercoverage that could \r\n[L1226] lead to bias.\r\n[L1227] 29. Baseball tickets Suppose you want to know the \r\n[L1228] average amount of money spent by the fans attending \r\n[L1229] opening day for the Cleveland Indians baseball sea\ufffeson. You get permission from the team\u2019s management \r\n[L1230] to conduct a survey at the stadium, but they will not \r\n[L1231] allow you to bother the fans in the club seating or box \r\n[L1232] seats (the most expensive seating). Using a computer, \r\n[L1233] you randomly select 500 seats from the rest of the \r\n[L1234] stadium. During the game, you ask the fans in those \r\n[L1235] seats how much they spent that day.\r\n[L1236] (a) Provide a reason why this survey might yield a \r\n[L1237] biased result.\r\n[L1238] (b) Explain whether the reason you provided in (a) is \r\n[L1239] a sampling error or a nonsampling error.\r\n[L1240] 30. What kind of error? Which of the following are \r\n[L1241] sources of sampling error and which are sources of \r\n[L1242] nonsampling error? Explain your answers.\r\n[L1243] (a) The subject lies about past drug use.\r\n[L1244] (b) A typing error is made in recording the data.\r\n[L1245] (c) Data are gathered by asking people to mail in a \r\n[L1246] coupon printed in a newspaper.\r\n[L1247] 31. Nonresponse A survey of drivers began by randomly \r\n[L1248] sampling all listed residential telephone numbers in \r\n[L1249] the United States. Of 45,956 calls to these numbers, \r\n[L1250] 5029 were completed. The goal of the survey was to \r\n[L1251] estimate how far people drive, on average, per day.14\r\n[L1252] (a) What was the rate of nonresponse for this sample?\r\n[L1253] (b) Explain how nonresponse can lead to bias in this \r\n[L1254] survey. Be sure to give the direction of the bias.\r\n[L1255] 32. Ring-no-answer A common form of nonresponse \r\n[L1256] in telephone surveys is \u201cring-no-answer.\u201d That is, a \r\n[L1257] call is made to an active number but no one answers. \r\n[L1258] The Italian National Statistical Institute looked at \r\n[L1259] nonresponse to a government survey of households \r\n[L1260] in Italy during the periods January 1 to Easter and \r\n[L1261] July 1 to August 31. All calls were made between 7 \r\n[L1262] and 10 p.m., but 21.4% gave \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in one \r\n[L1263] period versus 41.5% \u201cring-no-answer\u201d in the other \r\n[L1264] period.15 Which period do you think had the higher \r\n[L1265] rate of no answers? Why? Explain why a high rate of \r\n[L1266] nonresponse makes sample results less reliable.\r\n[L1267] 33. Running red lights The sample described in Exercise \r\n[L1268] 31 produced a list of 5024 licensed drivers. The inves\ufffetigators then chose an SRS of 880 of these drivers to \r\n[L1269] answer questions about their driving habits. One ques\ufffetion asked was: \u201cRecalling the last ten traffic lights you \r\n[L1270] drove through, how many of them were red when you \r\n[L1271] entered the intersections?\u201d Of the 880 respondents, \r\n[L1272] 171 admitted that at least one light had been red. A \r\n[L1273] practical problem with this survey is that people may \r\n[L1274] not give truthful answers. What is the likely direction \r\n[L1275] of the bias: do you think more or fewer than 171 of the \r\n[L1276] 880 respondents really ran a red light? Why?\r\n[L1277] 34. Seat belt use A study in El Paso, Texas, looked at seat \r\n[L1278] belt use by drivers. Drivers were observed at randomly \r\n[L1279] chosen convenience stores. After they left their cars, \r\n[L1280] they were invited to answer questions that included \r\n[L1281] questions about seat belt use. In all, 75% said they \r\n[L1282] always used seat belts, yet only 61.5% were wearing \r\n[L1283] seat belts when they pulled into the store parking \r\n[L1284] lots.16 Explain the reason for the bias observed in re\ufffesponses to the survey. Do you expect bias in the same \r\n[L1285] direction in most surveys about seat belt use?\r\n[L1286] 35.

Sample surveys are one kind of observational\r\n[L1406] study. Other observational studies watch the behavior of animals in the wild or the \r\n[L1407] interactions between teacher and students in the classroom. This section is about \r\n[L1408] statistical designs for experiments, a very different way to produce data.\r\n[L1409] Observational Study versus Experiment\r\n[L1410] In contrast to observational studies, experiments don\u2019t just observe individuals or \r\n[L1411] ask them questions. They actively impose some treatment in order to measure the \r\n[L1412] response. Experiments can answer questions like \u201cDoes aspirin reduce the chance \r\n[L1413] of a heart attack?\u201d and \u201cCan yoga help dogs live longer?\u201d\r\n[L1414] DEFINITION: Observational study and experiment\r\n[L1415] An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but \r\n[L1416] does not attempt to influence the responses.\r\n[L1417] An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their \r\n[L1418] responses.\r\n[L1419] The goal of an observational study can be to describe some group or situation, \r\n[L1420] to compare groups, or to examine relationships between variables. The purpose \r\n[L1421] of an experiment is to determine whether the treatment causes a change in the \r\n[L1422] response. An observational study, even one based on a random sample, is a poor \r\n[L1423] way to gauge the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable. To \r\n[L1424] see the response to a change, we must actually impose the change. When our goal \r\n[L1425] is to understand cause and effect, experiments are the only source of fully convincing \r\n[L1426] data. For this reason, the distinction between observational study and experiment \r\n[L1427] is one of the most important in statistics.\r\n[L1428] Does Taking Hormones Reduce Heart Attack Risk\r\n[L1429] after Menopause?\r\n[L1430] Observation versus experiment\r\n[L1431] Should women take hormones such as estrogen after menopause, when natural \r\n[L1432] production of these hormones ends? In 1992, several major medical organiza\ufffetions said \u201cYes.\u201d Women who took hormones seemed to reduce their risk of \r\n[L1433] a heart attack by 35% to 50%. The risks of taking hormones appeared \r\n[L1434] small compared with the benefits.\r\n[L1435] The evidence in favor of hormone replacement came from a num\ufffeber of observational studies that compared women who were taking \r\n[L1436] hormones with others who were not. But the women who chose to \r\n[L1437] take hormones were richer and better educated and saw doctors \r\n[L1438] more often than women who didn\u2019t take hormones.

Experiments don\u2019t let women decide what \r\n[L1466] to do. They assign women to either hormone replacement or to dummy pills that \r\n[L1467] look and taste the same as the hormone pills. The assignment is done by a coin \r\n[L1468] toss, so that all kinds of women are equally likely to get either treatment. By 2002, \r\n[L1469] several experiments with women of different ages agreed that hormone replace\ufffement does not reduce the risk of heart attacks. The National Institutes of Health, \r\n[L1470] after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the first studies were wrong. Taking \r\n[L1471] hormones after menopause quickly fell out of favor.18\r\n[L1472] For each of these studies, the explanatory variable was whether a woman took \r\n[L1473] hormones, and the response variable was whether the woman had a heart attack. \r\n[L1474] Researchers wanted to argue that changes in the explanatory variable (taking hor\ufffemones or not) actually caused changes in the response variable (having a heart \r\n[L1475] attack or not). In the early observational studies, however, the effect of taking \r\n[L1476] hormones was mixed up with the characteristics of women who chose to take \r\n[L1477] them. These characteristics are lurking variables that make it hard to see the true \r\n[L1478] relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\r\n[L1479] DEFINITION: Lurking variable\r\n[L1480] A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables \r\n[L1481] in a study but that may influence the response variable.\r\n[L1482] Let\u2019s consider two lurking variables from the observational studies of hormone \r\n[L1483] replacement: number of doctor visits per year and age. The women who chose to\r\n[L1484] take hormones visited their doctors more often than the women who didn\u2019t take \r\n[L1485] hormones. Did the women in the hormone group have fewer heart attacks because\r\n[L1486] they got better health care or because they took hormones? We can\u2019t be sure. \r\n[L1487] A situation like this, in which the effects of two variables on a response variable\r\n[L1488] cannot be separated from each other, is called confounding.\r\n[L1489] What about age? Older women are at greater risk of having a heart attack than \r\n[L1490] younger women. If the women who took hormones were generally younger than \r\n[L1491] those who didn\u2019t, we\u2019d have more confounding. That wasn\u2019t the case, however. \r\n[L1492] There was no link between age and group membership (hormones or not) in the \r\n[L1493] observational studies. With no association between the lurking variable and the \r\n[L1494] explanatory variable, there can be no confounding.\r\n[L1495] DEFINITION: Confounding\r\n[L1496] Confounding occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects \r\n[L1497] on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.","[L1498] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 28 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d8f59d843df8518#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":56529,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1499] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>","[L1500] Section 4.2 Experiments 233\r\n[L1501] Observational studies of the effect of one variable on another often fail \r\n[L1502] because of confounding between the explanatory variable and one or more \r\n[L1503] lurking variables. Well-designed experiments take steps to prevent con\ufffefounding. The later hormone therapy experiments avoided confounding by letting \r\n[L1504] chance decide who took hormones and who didn\u2019t. That way, women who took \r\n[L1505] better care of themselves were split about evenly between the two groups. So were \r\n[L1506] older women and younger women. When these experiments found no reduction \r\n[L1507] in heart attack risk for women taking hormones, researchers began to doubt the \r\n[L1508] results of the earlier observational studies.

Here is the basic vocabulary of experiments.\r\n[L1526] DEFINITION: Treatment, experimental units, subjects\r\n[L1527] A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment is called a treatment.\r\n[L1528] If an experiment has several explanatory variables, a treatment is a combination of \r\n[L1529] specific values of these variables.\r\n[L1530] The experimental units are the smallest collection of individuals to which treatments \r\n[L1531] are applied. When the units are human beings, they often are called subjects.\r\n[L1532] The best way to learn the language of experiments is to practice using it.\r\n[L1533] AP EXAM TIP If you \r\n[L1534] are asked to identify a \r\n[L1535] possible confounding \r\n[L1536] variable in a given \r\n[L1537] setting, you are \r\n[L1538] expected to explain how \r\n[L1539] the variable you choose \r\n[L1540] (1) is associated with \r\n[L1541] the explanatory variable \r\n[L1542] and (2) affects the \r\n[L1543] response variable.","[L1544] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 29 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://f7bf98df64cc647#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_28.jpg","size_bytes":58853,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1545] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 30 / 75>","[L1546] 234 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1547] EXAMPLE When Will I Ever Use This Stuff?\r\n[L1548] Vocabulary of experiments\r\n[L1549] Researchers at the University of North Carolina were concerned about the \r\n[L1550] increasing dropout rate in the state\u2019s high schools, especially for low-income stu\ufffedents. Surveys of recent dropouts revealed that many of these students had \r\n[L1551] started to lose interest during middle school. They said they saw little con\ufffenection between what they were studying in school and their future plans. \r\n[L1552] To change this perception, researchers developed a program called Ca\ufffereerStart. The big idea of the program is that teachers show students how \r\n[L1553] the topics they learn get used in specific careers.\r\n[L1554] To test the effectiveness of CareerStart, the researchers recruited 14 mid\ufffedle schools in Forsyth County to participate in an experiment. Seven of \r\n[L1555] the schools, chosen at random, used CareerStart along with the district\u2019s \r\n[L1556] standard curriculum. The other seven schools just followed the standard \r\n[L1557] curriculum. Researchers followed both groups of students for several \r\n[L1558] years, collecting data on students\u2019 attendance, behavior, standardized test \r\n[L1559] scores, level of engagement in school, and whether the students graduated from \r\n[L1560] high school. Results: Students at schools that used CareerStart generally had bet\ufffeter attendance and fewer discipline problems, earned higher test scores, reported \r\n[L1561] greater engagement in their classes, and were more likely to graduate.20\r\n[L1562] PROBLEM: Identify the experimental units, explanatory and response variables, and the treatments \r\n[L1563] in the CareerStart experiment.\r\n[L1564] SOLUTION: Theexperimental units are 14 middle schools in Forsyth County, NC. Theexplanatory \r\n[L1565] variable is whether the school used the CareerStart program with its students. This experiment \r\n[L1566] compares two treatments: (1) the standard middle school curriculum and (2) the standard curricu\ufffelum plus CareerStart. Several response variables were measured, including test scores, attendance, \r\n[L1567] behavior, student engagement, and graduation rates.\r\n[L1568] The previous example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over obser\ufffevational studies: experiments can give good evidence for causation. In an experi\ufffement, we study the effects of the specific treatments we are interested in, while \r\n[L1569] trying to control for the effect of lurking variables. For instance, the students in \r\n[L1570] all 14 schools followed the standard curriculum. To ensure that the two groups \r\n[L1571] of schools were as similar as possible before the treatments were administered, \r\n[L1572] researchers let chance decide which 7 schools would use CareerStart. The only \r\n[L1573] systematic difference between the schools was the educational treatment. When \r\n[L1574] students from the CareerStart schools did better, we can be confident that the \r\n[L1575] program made the difference.\r\n[L1576] Sometimes, the explanatory variables in an experiment are called factors. Many \r\n[L1577] experiments study the joint effects of several factors. In such an experiment, each \r\n[L1578] treatment is formed by combining a specific value (often called a level) of each of \r\n[L1579] the factors.

The response \r\n[L1601] variables include measures of subjects\u2019 recall of the ad, their \r\n[L1602] attitudes about the digital camera, and whether they intend to \r\n[L1603] purchase it.\r\n[L1604] (b) There are 2 different lengths of commercial (30 and 90 seconds) \r\n[L1605] and three different numbers of repetitions (1, 3, and 5). The 6 combi\ufffenations consisting of one level of each factor form the 6 treatments \r\n[L1606] shown in Figure 4.3: (1) 30 seconds, 1 time; (2) 30 seconds, 3 times; \r\n[L1607] (3) 30 seconds, 5 times; (4) 90 seconds, 1 time; (5) 90 seconds, \r\n[L1608] 3 times; (6) 90 seconds, 5 times.\r\n[L1609] This example shows how experiments allow us to study the combined effect of \r\n[L1610] several factors. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could \r\n[L1611] not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer \r\n[L1612] commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase \r\n[L1613] interest. But if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers \r\n[L1614] get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. The two-factor experiment in \r\n[L1615] the TV advertising example will help us find out.\r\n[L1616] How to Experiment Badly \r\n[L1617] Experiments are the preferred method for examining the effect of one variable on \r\n[L1618] another. By imposing the specific treatment of interest and controlling other \r\n[L1619] influences, we can pin down cause and effect. Good designs are essential for \r\n[L1620] effective experiments, just as they are for sampling. To see why, let\u2019s start with an \r\n[L1621] example of a bad experimental design.\r\n[L1622] Factor A\r\n[L1623] Length\r\n[L1624] Factor B\r\n[L1625] Repetitions\r\n[L1626] 30\r\n[L1627] seconds 1 2 3\r\n[L1628] 90\r\n[L1629] seconds\r\n[L1630] 1 time 3 times 5 times\r\n[L1631] 4 5 6\r\n[L1632] Subjects assigned\r\n[L1633] to Treatment 3 see\r\n[L1634] a 30-second ad\r\n[L1635] five times during\r\n[L1636] the program.\r\n[L1637] For Practice Try Exercise 55\r\n[L1638] FIGURE 4.3 The six treatments in the TV ad experiment. \r\n[L1639] Combinations of values of the two explanatory variables \r\n[L1640] (factors) form six treatments.","[L1641] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bcf9a5dddba7c8b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":57574,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1642] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 75>","[L1643] 236 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L1644] EXAMPLE Which Works Better: Online or In-Class \r\n[L1645] SAT Preparation?\r\n[L1646] A bad experiment\r\n[L1647] A high school regularly offers a review course to prepare students for \r\n[L1648] the SAT. This year, budget cuts will allow the school to offer only an \r\n[L1649] online version of the course. Over the past 10 years, the average SAT \r\n[L1650] score of students in the classroom course was 1620. The online group \r\n[L1651] gets an average score of 1780. That\u2019s roughly 10% higher than the long\ufffetime average for those who took the classroom review course. Is the \r\n[L1652] online course more effective?\r\n[L1653] This experiment has a very simple design. A group of subjects (the \r\n[L1654] students) were exposed to a treatment (the online course), and the \r\n[L1655] outcome (SAT scores) was observed. Here is the design:\r\n[L1656] Students \u2192 Online course \u2192 SAT scores\r\n[L1657] A closer look showed that the students in the online review course \r\n[L1658] were quite different from the students who took the classroom course \r\n[L1659] in past years. They had higher GPAs and were taking more AP classes.\r\n[L1660] The effect of online versus in-class instruction is mixed up with the \r\n[L1661] effect of these lurking variables. Maybe the online students earned \r\n[L1662] higher SAT scores because they were smarter to begin with, not \r\n[L1663] because the online course prepared them better. This confounding \r\n[L1664] prevents us from concluding that the online course is more effective than class\uffferoom instruction.\r\n[L1665] Many laboratory experiments use a design like the one in the online SAT course \r\n[L1666] example:\r\n[L1667] Experimental units \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Measure response\r\n[L1668] In the lab environment, simple designs often work well. Field experiments and \r\n[L1669] experiments with animals or people deal with more variable conditions.

Most well-designed experiments compare \r\n[L1675] two or more treatments.\r\n[L1676] Comparison alone isn\u2019t enough to produce results we can trust. If the treat\ufffements are given to groups that differ greatly when the experiment begins, bias will \r\n[L1677] result. For example, if we allow students to select online or classroom instruction, ","[L1678] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 32 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://4ab850cf09fa3b2#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_31.jpg","size_bytes":55977,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1679] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 33 / 75>","[L1680] Section 4.2 Experiments 237\r\n[L1681] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1682] more self-motivated students are likely to sign up for the online course.

The solution to the problem of bias in sampling is \r\n[L1684] random selection. In experiments, the solution is random assignment.\r\n[L1685] DEFINITION: Random assignment\r\n[L1686] In an experiment, random assignment means that experimental units are assigned to \r\n[L1687] treatments at random, that is, using some sort of chance process.\r\n[L1688] Let\u2019s look at how random assignment can be used to improve the design of the \r\n[L1689] SAT prep course experiment.\r\n[L1690] SAT Prep: Online versus Classroom\r\n[L1691] How random assignment works\r\n[L1692] This year, the high school has enough budget money to compare the \r\n[L1693] online SAT course with traditional classroom instruction. Fifty students \r\n[L1694] have agreed to participate in an experiment comparing the two instruc\ufffetional methods.\r\n[L1695] PROBLEM: Describe how you would randomly assign 25 students to each of the two \r\n[L1696] methods:\r\n[L1697] (a) Using 50 identical slips of paper\r\n[L1698] (b) Using Table D\r\n[L1699] (c) Using technology\r\n[L1700] SOLUTION:\r\n[L1701] (a) The simplest way would be to use the \u201chat method.\u201d Write each subject\u2019s name on \r\n[L1702] one of the slips. Put all the slips in a hat and mix them thoroughly. Draw them out one \r\n[L1703] at a time until you have 25 slips. These 25 students will take the online course. The \r\n[L1704] remaining 25 students will take the classroom course. Alternatively, you could write \r\n[L1705] \u201conline\u201d on 25 of the slips and \u201cclassroom\u201d on the other 25 slips. Then put the slips in \r\n[L1706] a hat and mix them well. Have students come up one by one and (without looking) pick a slip from the \r\n[L1707] hat. This guarantees 25 students per group, with the treatments assigned by chance.\r\n[L1708] (b) We can use the two-step process from random sampling to do the random assignment.\r\n[L1709] Step 1: Label. Give labels 01, 02, 03, . . . , 49, 50 to the subjects in alphabetical order by last \r\n[L1710] name.\r\n[L1711] Step 2: Table. Go to a line of Table D and read two-digit groups moving from left to right. The first \r\n[L1712] 25 distinct labels between 01 and 50 that you encounter select the online group. The remaining \r\n[L1713] 25\u00a0students will take the classroom course.

Then use \r\n[L1716] your calculator\u2019s randInt command or a computer\u2019s random number generator to produce numbers \r\n[L1717] between 1 and 50.

It is randomized because the sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments by chance. The diagram in Figure 4.4 presents \r\n[L1725] the details: random assignment, the sizes of the groups and which treatment they \r\n[L1726] receive, and the response variable. There are, as we will see later, statistical rea\ufffesons for using treatment groups that are about equal in size. This type of design is \r\n[L1727] called a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1728] 50 volunteer\r\n[L1729] students\r\n[L1730] Random\r\n[L1731] assignment\r\n[L1732] Group 1\r\n[L1733] 25 students\r\n[L1734] Group 2\r\n[L1735] 25 students\r\n[L1736] Compare\r\n[L1737] SAT scores\r\n[L1738] Treatment 2\r\n[L1739] Classroom\r\n[L1740] Treatment 1\r\n[L1741] Online\r\n[L1742] FIGURE 4.4 Outline of a completely randomized design to compare online and classroom \r\n[L1743] instruction.\r\n[L1744] DEFINITION: Completely randomized design\r\n[L1745] In a completely randomized design, the treatments are assigned to all the experimen\ufffetal units completely by chance.\r\n[L1746] Notice that the definition of a completely randomized design does not require \r\n[L1747] that each treatment be assigned to an equal number of experimental units. It does \r\n[L1748] specify that the assignment of treatments must occur completely at random.\r\n[L1749] Does using chance to assign treatments in an experiment guarantee a \r\n[L1750] completely randomized design? Actually, no. Let\u2019s return to the SAT prep \r\n[L1751] course experiment involving 50 students. Another way to randomly assign the sub\ufffejects to the two treatments is by tossing a coin. Have each student come forward \r\n[L1752] and toss a coin. If it\u2019s heads, then the student will take the course online. If it\u2019s \r\n[L1753] tails, then the student will take the classroom course.\r\n[L1754] As long as all 50 students toss a coin, this is still a completely randomized design.\r\n[L1755] Of course, the two experimental groups are unlikely to contain exactly 25 students \r\n[L1756] each due to the chance variation in coin tosses.\r\n[L1757] The problem comes if we try to force the two groups to have equal sizes. Sup\ufffepose we let the coin tossing continue until one of the groups has 25 students and \r\n[L1758] then place the remaining students in the other group. This is no longer a com\ufffepletely randomized design, because the last few students aren\u2019t being assigned \r\n[L1759] to one of the treatments by chance. In fact, these students will all end up in the \r\n[L1760] same group, which could lead to bias if these individuals share some character\ufffeistic that would systematically affect the response variable. For example, if the \r\n[L1761] students came to toss the coin last because they\u2019re lazier than the other students \r\n[L1762] who volunteered, then the SAT prep class that they\u2019re in will seem less effective \r\n[L1763] than it really is.\r\n[L1764] Completely randomized designs can compare any number of treatments.

An electric company considers placing small \r\n[L1776] digital displays in households to show current electricity use and what the cost \r\n[L1777] would be if this use continued for a month. Will the displays reduce electricity \r\n[L1778] use? One cheaper approach is to give customers a chart and information about \r\n[L1779] monitoring their electricity use from their outside meter. Would this method \r\n[L1780] work almost as well? The company decides to conduct an experiment to com\ufffepare these two approaches (display, chart) with a control group of customers \r\n[L1781] who receive information about energy consumption but no help in monitoring \r\n[L1782] electricity use.\r\n[L1783] PROBLEM: Outline a completely randomized design involving 60 single-family residences in the \r\n[L1784] same city who are willing to participate in such an experiment.

You might be thinking that the change \r\n[L1843] in electricity use from last year to this year in the houses with displays and charts \r\n[L1844] would tell us whether these treatments helped. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. \r\n[L1845] Suppose last year\u2019s temperatures were more extreme than this year\u2019s. Then many \r\n[L1846] households might show a decrease in electricity use, but we couldn\u2019t be sure \r\n[L1847] whether this change was due to the weather or to the treatments. (Can you say \r\n[L1848] confounding?!)\r\n[L1849] Many experiments (like the one in the previous example) include a control \r\n[L1850] group that receives an inactive treatment. However, a control group can be given \r\n[L1851] an active treatment. Suppose we want to compare the effectiveness of a newly \r\n[L1852] developed drug for treating a serious disease with a drug that\u2019s already known to \r\n[L1853] work. In that case, the experimental units that receive the existing drug form the \r\n[L1854] control group.\r\n[L1855] Some experimental designs don\u2019t include a control group. That\u2019s appropriate \r\n[L1856] if researchers simply want to compare the effects of several treatments, and not \r\n[L1857] to determine whether any of them works better than an inactive treatment. For \r\n[L1858] instance, maybe a state\u2019s highway department wants to see which of three brands \r\n[L1859] of paint will last longest when marking lane lines on the freeway.\r\n[L1860] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L1861] Music students often don\u2019t evaluate their own performances accurately. Can small-group \r\n[L1862] discussions help? The subjects were 29 students preparing for the end-of-semester per\ufffeformance that is an important part of their grade. Assign 15 students to the treatment: \r\n[L1863] videotape a practice performance, ask the student to evaluate it, then have the student \r\n[L1864] discuss the tape with a small group of other students. The remaining 14 students form a \r\n[L1865] control group who watch and evaluate their tapes alone. At the end of the semester, the \r\n[L1866] discussion-group students evaluated their final performance more accurately.22\r\n[L1867] 1. Outline a completely randomized design for this experiment.

Provide enough detail that \r\n[L1870] a classmate could implement your procedure.\r\n[L1871] 3. What is the purpose of the control group in this experiment?\r\n[L1872] Three Principles of \r\n[L1873] Experimental Design\r\n[L1874] Randomized comparative experiments are designed to give good evidence that \r\n[L1875] differences in the treatments actually cause the differences we see in the response. \r\n[L1876] The logic is as follows:\r\n[L1877] sA proper comparative design ensures that influences other than the experi\ufffemental treatments operate equally on all groups. This helps control for the \r\n[L1878] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1879] sRandom assignment helps balance out the effects of lurking variables that \r\n[L1880] we can\u2019t control, or don\u2019t think of, on the treatment groups. That is, random \r\n[L1881] assignment forms groups of experimental units that should be similar in all \r\n[L1882] respects before the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1883] ?\r\n[L1884] THINK\r\n[L1885] ABOUT\r\n[L1886] IT","[L1887] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 37 / 75>","[L1888] Section 4.2 Experiments 241\r\n[L1889] EXAMPLE\r\n[L1890] sTherefore, since the groups are roughly equivalent except for the treatments, \r\n[L1891] any differences in average response must be due either to the treatments or to the \r\n[L1892] play of chance in the random assignment of experimental units to the treatments.\r\n[L1893] The first two bullets give us two basic principles of experimental design: control\r\n[L1894] and random assignment. That \u201ceither-or\u201d in the last bullet deserves some more \r\n[L1895] thought. In the SAT prep course example, we can\u2019t say that any difference be\ufffetween the average SAT scores of students enrolled online and in the classroom \r\n[L1896] must be caused by a difference in the effectiveness of the two types of instruction. \r\n[L1897] There would be some difference even if both groups received the same instruction,\r\n[L1898] because of variation among students in background and study habits. Chance as\ufffesigns students to one group or the other, and this creates a chance difference \r\n[L1899] between the groups.\r\n[L1900] We would not trust an experiment with just one student in each group, for \r\n[L1901] example. The results would depend too much on which group got lucky and \r\n[L1902] received the stronger student. If we assign many subjects to each group, however, \r\n[L1903] the effects of chance will average out, and there will be little difference in the \r\n[L1904] average responses in the two groups unless the treatments themselves cause a dif\ufffeference. Our third design principle is replication: use enough experimental units \r\n[L1905] to distinguish a difference in the effects of the treatments from chance variation.\r\n[L1906] Summary: Principles of Experimental Design\r\n[L1907] The basic principles for designing experiments are as follows:\r\n[L1908] 1. Control for lurking variables that might affect the response: Use a com\ufffeparative design and ensure that the only systematic difference between the \r\n[L1909] groups is the treatment administered.\r\n[L1910] 2. Random assignment: Use impersonal chance to assign experimental \r\n[L1911] units to treatments. This helps create roughly equivalent groups of ex\ufffeperimental units by balancing the effects of lurking variables that aren\u2019t \r\n[L1912] controlled on the treatment groups.\r\n[L1913] 3. Replication: Use enough experimental units in each group so that any \r\n[L1914] differences in the effects of the treatments can be distinguished from \r\n[L1915] chance differences between the groups.\r\n[L1916] Let\u2019s see how these principles were used in designing a famous medical \r\n[L1917] experiment.\r\n[L1918] The Physicians\u2019 Health Study\r\n[L1919] A well-designed experiment\r\n[L1920] Does regularly taking aspirin help protect people against heart attacks? The Phy\ufffesicians\u2019 Health Study was a medical experiment that helped answer this ques\ufffetion. In fact, the Physicians\u2019 Health Study looked at the effects of two drugs: \r\n[L1921] aspirin and beta-carotene. Researchers wondered whether beta-carotene would \r\n[L1922] help prevent some forms of cancer. The subjects in this experiment were 21,996 \r\n[L1923] male physicians. There were two explanatory variables (factors), each having \r\n[L1924] two levels: aspirin (yes or no) and beta-carotene (yes or no).

One\ufffefourth of the subjects were assigned at random to each of these treatments.\r\n[L1931] On odd-numbered days, the subjects took either a tablet that contained as\ufffepirin or a dummy pill that looked and tasted like the aspirin but had no \r\n[L1932] active ingredient (a placebo). On even-numbered days, they took either a \r\n[L1933] capsule containing beta-carotene or a placebo. There were several response \r\n[L1934] variables\u2014the study looked for heart attacks, several kinds of cancer, and \r\n[L1935] other medical outcomes. After several years, 239 of the placebo group but \r\n[L1936] only 139 of the aspirin group had suffered heart attacks. This difference is \r\n[L1937] large enough to give good evidence that taking aspirin does reduce heart \r\n[L1938] attacks.23 It did not appear, however, that beta-carotene had any effect on \r\n[L1939] preventing cancer.\r\n[L1940] PROBLEM: Explain how each of the three principles of experimental \r\n[L1941] design was used in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study.\r\n[L1942] SOLUTION: Researchers attempted to control for the effects of \r\n[L1943] lurking variables by using a design that compared both of the active \r\n[L1944] treatments to a placebo and by having all subjects follow the same \r\n[L1945] schedule of pill\u00a0taking. Random assignment was used to determine \r\n[L1946] which subjects received each of the four treatment combinations. This\r\n[L1947] helped ensure that the treatment groups were roughly equivalent to \r\n[L1948] begin with. There were over 5000 subjects per treatment group. This\r\n[L1949] replication helped ensure that any sizable difference in response among \r\n[L1950] the groups was due to the treatments and not to chance variation in \r\n[L1951] the random assignment.\r\n[L1952] The control group in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study received inactive versions \r\n[L1953] (placebos) of both aspirin and beta-carotene. This group served as a compari\ufffeson for the effects of aspirin alone, beta-carotene alone, and aspirin plus beta\ufffecarotene.\r\n[L1954] Experiments: What Can Go Wrong?\r\n[L1955] The logic of a randomized comparative experiment depends on our ability to treat \r\n[L1956] all the subjects the same in every way except for the actual treatments being com\ufffepared. Good experiments, therefore, require careful attention to details to ensure \r\n[L1957] that all subjects really are treated identically.\r\n[L1958] If some subjects in a medical experiment take a pill each day and a control \r\n[L1959] group takes no pill, the subjects are not treated identically. Many medical experi\ufffements are therefore \u201cplacebo-controlled,\u201d like the Physicians\u2019 Health Study. All \r\n[L1960] the subjects received the same medical attention during the several years of the \r\n[L1961] experiment. On odd-numbered days, all of them took an aspirin or a placebo. \r\n[L1962] On even-numbered days, all subjects took either a beta-carotene pill or a pla\ufffecebo. Many patients respond favorably to any treatment, even a placebo, perhaps \r\n[L1963] because they trust the doctor.

If some subjects did not take any pills, the effect of aspirin or \r\n[L1980] beta-carotene would be confounded with the placebo effect, the effect of simply \r\n[L1981] taking pills.\r\n[L1982] Curing Baldness and Soothing Pain\r\n[L1983] Do placebos work?\r\n[L1984] Want to help balding men keep their hair? Give them a placebo\u2014one study found \r\n[L1985] that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their \r\n[L1986] heads when they took a placebo. In another study, researchers zapped the wrists of \r\n[L1987] 24 test subjects with a painful jolt of electricity. Then they rubbed a cream with no \r\n[L1988] active medicine on subjects\u2019 wrists and told them the cream should help soothe \r\n[L1989] the pain. When researchers shocked them again, 8 subjects said they experienced \r\n[L1990] significantly less pain.24\r\n[L1991] When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think \r\n[L1992] that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the \r\n[L1993] placebo effect.25 Others disagree. The strength of the placebo effect in medical \r\n[L1994] treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How \r\n[L1995] enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But \u201cplacebos work\u201d is a good \r\n[L1996] place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.\r\n[L1997] The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized compara\ufffetive experiments. In the baldness study, 42% of the placebo group kept or increased \r\n[L1998] their hair, but 86% of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug \r\n[L1999] beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of \r\n[L2000] course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.\r\n[L2001] Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a \r\n[L2002] medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing \r\n[L2003] that they are getting \u201cjust a placebo\u201d might weaken the placebo effect and bias the \r\n[L2004] experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and \r\n[L2005] other medical personnel what treatment each subject received. If they know that a \r\n[L2006] subject is getting \u201cjust a placebo,\u201d they may expect less than if they know the sub\ufffeject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors\u2019 expectations change how \r\n[L2007] they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. \r\n[L2008] Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be double-blind.\r\n[L2009] Placebo effect","[L2010] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 39 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://cbbb73079451a3b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_38.jpg","size_bytes":57058,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2011] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>","[L2012] 244 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2013] The idea of a double-blind design is simple. Until the experiment ends and the \r\n[L2014] results are in, only the study\u2019s statistician knows for sure which treatment a subject \r\n[L2015] is receiving. However, some experiments cannot be carried out in a double-blind \r\n[L2016] manner. If researchers are comparing the effects of exercise and dieting on weight \r\n[L2017] loss, then subjects will know which treatment they are receiving. Such an experi\ufffement can still be single-blind if the individuals who are interacting with the sub\ufffejects and measuring the response variable don\u2019t know who is dieting and who is \r\n[L2018] exercising. In other single-blind experiments, the subjects are unaware of which \r\n[L2019] treatment they are receiving, but the people interacting with them and measuring \r\n[L2020] the response variable do know.\r\n[L2021] Single-blind\r\n[L2022] DEFINITION: Double-blind\r\n[L2023] In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor those who interact with them \r\n[L2024] and measure the response variable know which treatment a subject received.\r\n[L2025] CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING\r\n[L2026] In an interesting experiment, researchers examined the effect of ultrasound on birth \r\n[L2027] weight. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly assigned to one of \r\n[L2028] two groups. The first group of women received an ultrasound; the second group did not. \r\n[L2029] When the subjects\u2019 babies were born, their birth weights were recorded. The women who \r\n[L2030] received the ultrasounds had heavier babies.27\r\n[L2031] 1. Did the experimental design take the placebo effect into account? Why is this important?\r\n[L2032] 2. Was the experiment double-blind? Why is this important?\r\n[L2033] 3. Based on your answers to Questions 1 and 2, describe an improved design for this \r\n[L2034] experiment.\r\n[L2035] Inference for Experiments\r\n[L2036] In an experiment, researchers usually hope to see a difference in the responses so \r\n[L2037] large that it is unlikely to happen just because of chance variation. We can use the \r\n[L2038] laws of probability, which describe chance behavior, to learn whether the treat\ufffement effects are larger than we would expect to see if only chance were operating. \r\n[L2039] If they are, we call them statistically significant.\r\n[L2040] DEFINITION: Statistically significant\r\n[L2041] An observed effect so large that it would rarely occur by chance is called statistically \r\n[L2042] significant.\r\n[L2043] If we observe statistically significant differences among the groups in a random\ufffeized comparative experiment, we have good evidence that the treatments actually \r\n[L2044] caused these differences. You will often see the phrase \u201cstatistically significant\u201d in \r\n[L2045] published research reports in many fields. The great advantage of randomized com\ufffeparative experiments is that they can produce data that give good evidence for a \r\n[L2046] cause-and-effect relationship between the explanatory and response variables. We \r\n[L2047] know that in general a strong association does not imply causation. A statistically sig\ufffenificant association in data from a well-designed experiment does imply causation.","[L2048] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 40 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://b86211c359fd2c0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_39.jpg","size_bytes":53857,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2049] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 41 / 75>","[L2050] Section 4.2 Experiments 245\r\n[L2051] ACTIVITY Distracted driving\r\n[L2052] MATERIALS: Deck of cards for each team of 3 to 4 students\r\n[L2053] Is talking on a cell phone while driving more distracting than talking to \r\n[L2054] a passenger? David Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah \r\n[L2055] designed an experiment to help answer this question. They used 48 un\ufffedergraduate students as subjects. The researchers randomly assigned half \r\n[L2056] of the subjects to drive in a simulator while talking on a cell phone, and \r\n[L2057] the other half to drive in the simulator while talking to a passenger. One \r\n[L2058] response variable was whether the driver stopped at a rest area that was \r\n[L2059] specified by researchers before the simulation started.

Since \r\n[L2070] we\u2019re assuming that the treatment received won\u2019t change whether each driver \r\n[L2071] stops at the rest area, we use 33 cards to represent drivers who stop and 15 cards \r\n[L2072] to represent those who don\u2019t.

If more drivers in that group fail to stop at the rest area, we don\u2019t know \r\n[L2106] if it\u2019s because of the treatment they received (cell phone or passenger) or their \r\n[L2107] forgetfulness. Is this confounding?\r\n[L2108] You might be surprised that the answer is \u201cNo!\u201d Although people\u2019s memory is \r\n[L2109] a lurking variable that might affect whether they stop at the rest area (the \r\n[L2110] response variable), the design of the experiment takes care of this by randomly \r\n[L2111] assigning subjects to the two treatment groups. The \u201cunlucky\u201d random assign\ufffements are taken into account in determining statistical significance. In an \r\n[L2112] experiment, confounding occurs when the design doesn\u2019t account for existing \r\n[L2113] differences in the experimental units that might systematically affect their \r\n[L2114] response to the treatments.\r\n[L2115] Blocking\r\n[L2116] Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experi\ufffements. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, random assignment, and \r\n[L2117] replication. But just as with sampling, there are times when the simplest method \r\n[L2118] doesn\u2019t yield the most precise results. When a population consists of groups of \r\n[L2119] individuals that are \u201csimilar within but different between,\u201d a stratified random \r\n[L2120] sample gives a better estimate than a simple random sample.

Researchers would like to \r\n[L2210] design an experiment to compare the effectiveness of three advertisements for the \r\n[L2211] same product.\r\n[L2212] PROBLEM:\r\n[L2213] (a) Explain why a randomized block design might be preferable to a completely randomized design for \r\n[L2214] this experiment.\r\n[L2215] (b) Outline a randomized block design using 300 volunteers (180 men and 120 women) as sub\ufffejects. Describe how you would carry out the random assignment required by your design.\r\n[L2216] SOLUTION:\r\n[L2217] (a) A completely randomized design considers all subjects, both men and women, as a single pool. \r\n[L2218] The random assignment would send subjects to three treatment groups without regard to their \r\n[L2219] gender. This ignores the differences between men and women, which would probably result in a great \r\n[L2220] deal of variability in responses to the advertising in all three groups. For example, if an ad appealed \r\n[L2221] 300\r\n[L2222] volunteer\r\n[L2223] subjects\r\n[L2224] Women\r\n[L2225] n  120\r\n[L2226] Random\r\n[L2227] assignment\r\n[L2228] Group 1\r\n[L2229] n  40\r\n[L2230] Group 3\r\n[L2231] n  40\r\n[L2232] Compare\r\n[L2233] reaction\r\n[L2234] Group 2\r\n[L2235] n  40\r\n[L2236] Ad 1\r\n[L2237] Ad 2\r\n[L2238] Ad 3\r\n[L2239] Men\r\n[L2240] n  180\r\n[L2241] Random\r\n[L2242] assignment\r\n[L2243] Group 1\r\n[L2244] n  60\r\n[L2245] Group 3\r\n[L2246] n  60\r\n[L2247] Compare\r\n[L2248] reaction\r\n[L2249] Group 2\r\n[L2250] n  60\r\n[L2251] Ad 1\r\n[L2252] Ad 2\r\n[L2253] Ad 3\r\n[L2254] FIGURE 4.8 Randomized block design for comparing responses to three advertisements.

The idea is to create blocks by matching pairs of similar \r\n[L2262] experimental units. Then we can use chance to decide which member of a pair \r\n[L2263] gets the first treatment. The other subject in that pair gets the other treatment. \r\n[L2264] That is, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is done within each \r\n[L2265] matched pair. Just as with other forms of blocking, matching helps reduce the \r\n[L2266] effect of variation among the experimental units.\r\n[L2267] Sometimes each \u201cpair\u201d in a matched pairs design consists of just one experi\ufffemental unit that gets both treatments one after the other. In that case, each experi\ufffemental unit serves as its own control. The order of the treatments can influence \r\n[L2268] the response, so we randomize the order for each experimental unit.\r\n[L2269] Matched pairs design\r\n[L2270] much more to men, you would get a wide range of reactions to that ad from the two genders. That \r\n[L2271] would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the ads.\r\n[L2272] A randomized block design would consider women and men separately. In this case, the random \r\n[L2273] assignment would occur separately in each block. Blocking will control for the variability in responses \r\n[L2274] to advertising due to gender. This will allow researchers to look separately at the reactions of men \r\n[L2275] and women, as well as to more effectively assess the overall response to the ads.\r\n[L2276] (b) Figure 4.8 outlines the randomized block design. We randomly assign the 120 women into three \r\n[L2277] groups of 40, one for each of the advertising treatments. Give each woman a distinct label between \r\n[L2278] 1 and 120. Use a computer\u2019s random number generator to sort the numbers from 1 to 120 in a \r\n[L2279] random order. The women with labels corresponding to the first 40 numbers in the list will view Ad 1, \r\n[L2280] the next 40 will view Ad 2, and the last 40 will view Ad 3. Randomly assign the 180 men into three \r\n[L2281] groups of 60 using a similar process. After each subject has viewed the assigned ad, compare reac\ufffetions to the three ads within the gender blocks.\r\n[L2282] For Practice Try Exercise 79\r\n[L2283] ACTIVITY Get your heart beating\r\n[L2284] MATERIALS: Clock or stopwatch\r\n[L2285] Are standing pulse rates generally higher than sitting pulse rates? In this Activity, \r\n[L2286] you will perform two experiments to try to answer this question.\r\n[L2287] 1. Completely randomized design For the first experiment, you\u2019ll randomly \r\n[L2288] assign half of the students in your class to stand and the other half to sit. You can \r\n[L2289] use the hat method, Table D, or technology to carry out the random assignment. \r\n[L2290] Once the two treatment groups have been formed, students should stand or sit \r\n[L2291] as required. Then they should measure their pulses for one minute. Have the \r\n[L2292] subjects in each group record their data on the board.\r\n[L2293] 2. Matched pairs design In a matched pairs design, each student should receive \r\n[L2294] both treatments in a random order. Since you already sat or stood in Step 1, \r\n[L2295] you just need to do the opposite now. As before, everyone should measure their \r\n[L2296] pulses for one minute after completing the treatment (that is, once they are \r\n[L2297] standing or sitting). Have all the subjects record their data (both measurements) \r\n[L2298] in a chart on the board.","[L2299] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 45 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://d19bf42557d3861#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_44.jpg","size_bytes":57481,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2300] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>","[L2301] 250 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2302] 3. Analyze the data for the completely randomized design. Make a dotplot and \r\n[L2303] calculate the mean pulse rate for each group. Is there evidence that standing \r\n[L2304] pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2305] 4. Analyze the data for the matched pairs design. Since the data are paired \r\n[L2306] by student, your first step should be to calculate the difference in pulse rate \r\n[L2307] (standing \u2013 sitting) for each subject. Make a dotplot of these differences and cal\ufffeculate their mean. Is there evidence that standing pulse rates are higher? Explain.\r\n[L2308] 5. What advantage does the matched pairs design have over the completely \r\n[L2309] randomized design?\r\n[L2310] An AP Statistics class with 24 students performed the \u201cGet Your Heart Beating\u201d \r\n[L2311] Activity. We\u2019ll analyze the results of their experiment in the following example.\r\n[L2312] EXAMPLE Standing and Sitting Pulse Rate\r\n[L2313] Design determines analysis\r\n[L2314] A Fathom dotplot of the pulse rates for their completely \r\n[L2315] randomized design is shown. The mean pulse rate for the \r\n[L2316] standing group is 74.83; the mean for the sitting group is \r\n[L2317] 68.33. So the average pulse rate is 6.5 beats per minute \r\n[L2318] higher in the standing group. However, the variability in \r\n[L2319] pulse rates for the two groups creates a lot of overlap in the \r\n[L2320] graph. These data don\u2019t provide convincing evidence that \r\n[L2321] standing pulse rates tend to be higher.\r\n[L2322] What about the class\u2019s matched pairs experiment? The \r\n[L2323] Fathom dotplot shows their data on the difference in pulse \r\n[L2324] rates (standing \u2013 sitting). For these 24 students, the mean \r\n[L2325] difference was 6.8 beats per minute. In addition, 21 of the \r\n[L2326] 24 students recorded a positive difference (meaning the \r\n[L2327] standing pulse rate was higher). These data provide strong \r\n[L2328] evidence that people\u2019s standing pulse rates tend to be high\ufffeer than their sitting pulse rates.\r\n[L2329] Let\u2019s take one more look at the two Fathom dotplots in the example. Notice \r\n[L2330] that we used the same scale for both graphs. This is to help you visually com\ufffepare the amount of variability in the response variable for each of the two \r\n[L2331] experimental designs. Blocking by subject in the matched pairs design greatly \r\n[L2332] reduced the variability in the response variable. That made it easier to detect \r\n[L2333] the fact that standing causes an increase in pulse rate. With the large amount \r\n[L2334] of variability in the completely randomized design, we were unable to draw \r\n[L2335] such a conclusion.","[L2336] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 46 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://5c9678406de9a79#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_45.jpg","size_bytes":52515,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2337] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 47 / 75>","[L2338] Section 4.2 Experiments 251\r\n[L2339] Another important lesson to take away from the example is this: the design of the \r\n[L2340] study determines the appropriate method of analysis. For the completely random\ufffeized design, it makes sense to compare pulse rates for the two groups with parallel \r\n[L2341] dotplots and means. In the matched pairs design, each student is a block. We \r\n[L2342] compare the effects of the treatments within each block by examining the differ\ufffeences in standing and sitting pulse rates for each student.\r\n[L2343] The following Data Exploration asks you to apply what you have learned about \r\n[L2344] analyzing data from an experiment.\r\n[L2345] DATA EXPLORATION Nitrogen in tires\u2014a lot of hot air?\r\n[L2346] Most automobile tires are inflated with compressed air, which consists of about \r\n[L2347] 78% nitrogen. Aircraft tires are filled with pure nitrogen, which is safer than air \r\n[L2348] in case of fire. Could filling automobile tires with nitrogen improve safety, perfor\ufffemance, or both?\r\n[L2349] Consumers Union designed a study to test whether nitrogen-filled tires would \r\n[L2350] maintain pressure better than air-filled tires. They obtained two tires from each of \r\n[L2351] several brands and then filled one tire in each pair with air and one with nitrogen. \r\n[L2352] All tires were inflated to a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch and then placed \r\n[L2353] outside for a year. At the end of the year, Consumers Union measured the pres\ufffesure in each tire. The amount of pressure lost (in pounds per square inch) during \r\n[L2354] the year for the air-filled and nitrogen-filled tires of each brand is shown in the \r\n[L2355] table below.29\r\n[L2356] Brand Air Nitrogen Brand Air Nitrogen\r\n[L2357] BF Goodrich Traction T/A HR 7.6 7.2 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 4.4 4.2\r\n[L2358] Bridgestone HP50 (Sears) 3.8 2.5 Sumitomo HTR H4 1.4 2.1\r\n[L2359] Bridgestone Potenza G009 3.7 1.6 Yokohama Avid H4S 4.3 3.0\r\n[L2360] Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.7 1.5 BF Goodrich Traction T/A V 5.5 3.4\r\n[L2361] Bridgestone Potenza EL400 2.1 1.0 Bridgestone Potenza RE950 4.1 2.8\r\n[L2362] Continental Premier Contact H 4.9 3.1 Continental ContiExtreme Contact 5.0 3.4\r\n[L2363] Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 5.2 3.5 Continental ContiProContact 4.8 3.3\r\n[L2364] Dayton Daytona HR 3.4 3.2 Cooper Lifeliner Touring SLE 3.2 2.5\r\n[L2365] Falken Ziex ZE-512 4.1 3.3 General Exclaim UHP 6.8 2.7\r\n[L2366] Fuzion Hrl 2.7 2.2 Hankook Ventus V4 H105 3.1 1.4\r\n[L2367] General Exclaim 3.1 3.4 Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.5 1.5\r\n[L2368] Goodyear Assurance Tripletred 3.8 3.2 Michelin Pilot Exalto A/S 6.6 2.2\r\n[L2369] Hankook Optimo H418 3.0 0.9 Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 2.2 2.0\r\n[L2370] Kumho Solus KH16 6.2 3.4 Pirelli P6 Four Seasons 2.5 2.7\r\n[L2371] Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus 2.0 1.8 Sumitomo HTR+ 4.4 3.7\r\n[L2372] Michelin Pilot XGT H4 1.1 0.7\r\n[L2373] Does filling tires with nitrogen instead of compressed air reduce pressure loss? \r\n[L2374] Give appropriate graphical and numerical evidence to support your answer.","[L2375] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>","[L2376] 252 CHAPTER CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2377] s We can produce data intended to answer specific questions by observational\r\n[L2378] studies or experiments. An observational study gathers data on individuals \r\n[L2379] as they are. Experiments actively do something to people, animals, or \r\n[L2380] objects in order to measure their response.\r\n[L2381] s Statistical studies often try to show that changing one variable (the \r\n[L2382] explanatory variable) causes changes in another variable (the response\r\n[L2383] variable). Variables are confounded when their effects on a response can\u2019t \r\n[L2384] be distinguished from each other. Observational studies and uncontrolled \r\n[L2385] experiments often fail to show that changes in an explanatory variable \r\n[L2386] actually cause changes in a response variable because the explanatory \r\n[L2387] variable is confounded with lurking variables.\r\n[L2388] s In an experiment, we impose one or more treatments on a group of experi\ufffemental units (sometimes called subjects if they are human). Each treatment \r\n[L2389] is a combination of values of the explanatory variables (also called factors).\r\n[L2390] s The design of an experiment describes the choice of treatments and the \r\n[L2391] manner in which the subjects are assigned to the treatments. The basic \r\n[L2392] principles of experimental design are control for lurking variables, random \r\n[L2393] assignment of treatments, and replication (using enough experimental units).\r\n[L2394] s The simplest form of control is comparison. Experiments should compare \r\n[L2395] two or more treatments to avoid confounding of the effect of a treatment \r\n[L2396] with other influences, such as lurking variables.\r\n[L2397] s Random assignment uses chance to assign subjects to the treatments. \r\n[L2398] Random assignment creates treatment groups that are similar (except for \r\n[L2399] chance variation) before the treatments are applied. Randomization and \r\n[L2400] comparison together prevent bias, or systematic favoritism, in experiments.\r\n[L2401] s Applying each treatment to many experimental units (replication)\r\n[L2402] reduces the role of chance variation and makes the experiment more \r\n[L2403] likely to detect differences in the effects of the treatments.\r\n[L2404] s Many behavioral and medical experiments are double-blind. That is, \r\n[L2405] neither the subjects nor those interacting with them and measuring their \r\n[L2406] responses know who is receiving which treatment. If one party knows and \r\n[L2407] the other doesn\u2019t, then the experiment is single-blind.\r\n[L2408] s Some experiments give a placebo (fake treatment) to a control group. \r\n[L2409] That helps prevent confounding due to the placebo effect, in which some \r\n[L2410] patients get better because they expect the treatment to work even though \r\n[L2411] they have received an inactive treatment.\r\n[L2412] s In addition to comparison, a second form of control is to form blocks of \r\n[L2413] individuals that are similar in some way that is important to the response. \r\n[L2414] Randomization is then carried out separately within each block. Blocking \r\n[L2415] helps reduce unwanted variability among experimental units.\r\n[L2416] s Matched pairs are a common form of blocking for comparing just two \r\n[L2417] treatments. In some matched pairs designs, each subject receives both \r\n[L2418] treatments in a random order. In others, the subjects are matched in pairs as \r\n[L2419] closely as possible, and each subject in a pair receives one of the treatments.\r\n[L2420] Summary SECTION 4.2","[L2421] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 48 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://84975c497ea811f#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_47.jpg","size_bytes":58140,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 49 / 75>","[L2423] Section 4.2 Experiments 253\r\n[L2424] 45.

Some students \r\n[L2517] will pay a low flat rate. Others will pay higher rates at \r\n[L2518] peak periods and very low rates off-peak. The univer\ufffesity is interested in the amount and time of use and in \r\n[L2519] the effect on the congestion of the network.\r\n[L2520] 53. Improving response rate How can we reduce the \r\n[L2521] rate of refusals in telephone surveys? Most people \r\n[L2522] who answer at all listen to the interviewer\u2019s introduc\ufffetory remarks and then decide whether to continue. \r\n[L2523] One study made telephone calls to randomly selected \r\n[L2524] households to ask opinions about the next election. In \r\n[L2525] some calls, the interviewer gave her name, in others \r\n[L2526] she identified the university she was representing, \r\n[L2527] and in still others she identified both herself and the \r\n[L2528] university. For each type of call, the interviewer either \r\n[L2529] did or did not offer to send a copy of the final survey \r\n[L2530] results to the person interviewed. Do these differences \r\n[L2531] in the introduction affect whether the interview is \r\n[L2532] completed?\r\n[L2533] 54. Eat well and exercise Most American adolescents \r\n[L2534] don\u2019t eat well and don\u2019t exercise enough. Can middle \r\n[L2535] schools increase physical activity among \r\n[L2536] their students? Can they persuade students to eat \r\n[L2537] better? Investigators designed a \u201cphysical activity \r\n[L2538] intervention\u201d to increase activity in physical educa\ufffetion classes and during leisure periods throughout the \r\n[L2539] school day. They also designed a \u201cnutrition interven\ufffetion\u201d that improved school lunches and offered ideas \r\n[L2540] for healthy home-packed lunches. Each participating \r\n[L2541] school was randomly assigned to one of the interven\ufffetions, both interventions, or no intervention. The \r\n[L2542] investigators observed physical activity and lunchtime \r\n[L2543] consumption of fat.\r\n[L2544] 55. Fabric science A maker of fabric for clothing is set\ufffeting up a new line to \u201cfinish\u201d the raw fabric. The line \r\n[L2545] will use either metal rollers or natural-bristle rollers to \r\n[L2546] raise the surface of the fabric; a dyeing-cycle time of \r\n[L2547] either 30 or 40 minutes; and a temperature of either \r\n[L2548] 150\u00b0 or 175\u00b0 Celsius. An experiment will compare all \r\n[L2549] combinations of these choices. Three specimens of \r\n[L2550] fabric will be subjected to each treatment and scored \r\n[L2551] for quality.\r\n[L2552] 56. Exercise and heart rate A student project measured \r\n[L2553] the increase in the heart rates of fellow students when \r\n[L2554] they stepped up and down for three minutes to the \r\n[L2555] beat of a metronome. The step was either 5.75 or 11.5 \r\n[L2556] inches high and the metronome beat was 14, 21, or \r\n[L2557] 28 steps per minute. Five students stepped at each \r\n[L2558] combination of height and speed.\r\n[L2559] 57. Cocoa and blood flow A study conducted by Nor\ufffeman Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham \r\n[L2560] and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, \r\n[L2561] involved 27 healthy people aged 18 to 72. Each \r\n[L2562] subject consumed a cocoa beverage containing 900 \r\n[L2563] milligrams of flavonols (a class of flavonoids) daily \r\n[L2564] for five days. Using a finger cuff, blood flow was mea\ufffesured on the first and fifth days of the study. After five \r\n[L2565] days, researchers measured what they called \u201csignifi\ufffecant improvement\u201d in blood flow and the function of \r\n[L2566] the cells that line the blood vessels.33 What flaw in the \r\n[L2567] design of this experiment makes it impossible to say \r\n[L2568] whether the cocoa really caused the improved blood \r\n[L2569] flow? Explain.\r\n[L2570] 58. Reducing unemployment Will cash bonuses speed \r\n[L2571] the return to work of unemployed people? A state \r\n[L2572] department of labor notes that last year 68% of people \r\n[L2573] who filed claims for unemployment insurance found \r\n[L2574] a new job within 15 weeks. As an experiment, this year \r\n[L2575] the state offers $500 to people filing unemployment \r\n[L2576] claims if they find a job within 15 weeks. The percent \r\n[L2577] who do so increases to 77%. What flaw in the design \r\n[L2578] of this experiment makes it impossible to say whether \r\n[L2579] the bonus really caused the increase? Explain.\r\n[L2580] 59. Layoffs and \u201csurvivor guilt\u201d Workers who survive a \r\n[L2581] layoff of other employees at their location may suffer \r\n[L2582] from \u201csurvivor guilt.\u201d A study of survivor guilt and \r\n[L2583] its effects used as subjects 120 students who were \r\n[L2584] offered an opportunity to earn extra course credit by \r\n[L2585] doing proofreading. Each subject worked in the same \r\n[L2586] cubicle as another student, who was an accomplice \r\n[L2587] of the experimenters. At a break midway through the \r\n[L2588] work, one of three things happened:\r\n[L2589] Treatment 1: The accomplice was told to leave; it was \r\n[L2590] explained that this was because she performed poorly.\r\n[L2591] Treatment 2: It was explained that unforeseen circum\ufffestances meant there was only enough work for one \r\n[L2592] person. By \u201cchance,\u201d the accomplice was chosen to \r\n[L2593] be laid off.\r\n[L2594] Treatment 3: Both students continued to work after \r\n[L2595] the break.\r\n[L2596] The subjects\u2019 work performance after the break \r\n[L2597] was compared with performance before the break.34\r\n[L2598] Describe how you would randomly assign the \r\n[L2599] subjects to the treatments\r\n[L2600] (a) using slips of paper.\r\n[L2601] (b) using Table D.\r\n[L2602] (c) using technology.\r\n[L2603] 60. Effects of TV advertising Figure 4.3 (page 235) dis\ufffeplays the 6 treatments for a two-factor experiment on \r\n[L2604] TV advertising. Suppose we have 150 students who \r\n[L2605] are willing to serve as subjects. Describe how you \r\n[L2606] would randomly assign the subjects to the treatments\r\n[L2607] (a) using slips of paper.\r\n[L2608] (b) using Table D.\r\n[L2609] (c) using technology.\r\n[L2610] pg 235\r\n[L2611] pg 237","[L2612] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 51 / 75>","[L2613] Section 4.2 Experiments 255\r\n[L2614] 61. Headache relief Doctors identify \u201cchronic tension\ufffetype headaches\u201d as headaches that occur almost \r\n[L2615] daily for at least six months. Can antidepressant \r\n[L2616] medications or stress management training reduce \r\n[L2617] the number and severity of these headaches? Are both \r\n[L2618] together more effective than either alone? Investiga\ufffetors compared four treatments: antidepressant alone, \r\n[L2619] placebo alone, antidepressant plus stress manage\ufffement, and placebo plus stress management. The \r\n[L2620] headache sufferers named in the following table have \r\n[L2621] agreed to participate in the study.\r\n[L2622] Acosta Duncan Han Liang Padilla Valasco\r\n[L2623] Asihiro Durr Howard Maldonado Plochman Vaughn\r\n[L2624] Bennett Edwards Hruska Marsden Rosen Wei\r\n[L2625] Bikalis Farouk Imrani Montoya Solomon Wilder\r\n[L2626] Chen Fleming James O\u2019Brian Trujillo Willis\r\n[L2627] Clemente George Kaplan Ogle Tullock Zhang\r\n[L2628] (a) Outline the design of the experiment.

Then carry out \r\n[L2632] your random assignment.\r\n[L2633] 62. More rain for California? The changing climate will \r\n[L2634] probably bring more rain to California, but we don\u2019t \r\n[L2635] know whether the additional rain will come during the \r\n[L2636] winter wet season or extend into the long dry season in \r\n[L2637] spring and summer. Kenwyn Suttle of the University \r\n[L2638] of California at Berkeley and his coworkers carried \r\n[L2639] out an experiment to study the effects of more rain in \r\n[L2640] either season. They randomly assigned plots of open \r\n[L2641] grassland to 3 treatments: added water equal to 20% of \r\n[L2642] annual rainfall either during January to March (winter) \r\n[L2643] or during April to June (spring), and no added water \r\n[L2644] (control). Thirty-six circular plots of area 70 square me\ufffeters were available (see the photo), of which 18 were \r\n[L2645] used for this study. One response variable was total \r\n[L2646] plant biomass, in grams per square meter, produced in \r\n[L2647] a plot over a year.35\r\n[L2648] (a) Outline the design of the experiment.

Treating prostate disease A large study used records \r\n[L2654] from Canada\u2019s national health care system to com\ufffepare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate \r\n[L2655] disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery \r\n[L2656] and a new method that does not require surgery. The \r\n[L2657] records described many patients whose doctors had \r\n[L2658] chosen each method. The study found that patients \r\n[L2659] treated by the new method were significantly more \r\n[L2660] likely to die within 8 years.36\r\n[L2661] (a) Further study of the data showed that this conclu\ufffesion was wrong. The extra deaths among patients who \r\n[L2662] got the new method could be explained by lurking vari\ufffeables. What lurking variables might be confounded with \r\n[L2663] a doctor\u2019s choice of surgical or nonsurgical treatment?\r\n[L2664] (b) You have 300 prostate patients who are willing to \r\n[L2665] serve as subjects in an experiment to compare the two \r\n[L2666] methods. Write a few sentences describing how you \r\n[L2667] would design this experiment.\r\n[L2668] 64. Getting teachers to come to school Elementary \r\n[L2669] schools in rural India are usually small, with a single \r\n[L2670] teacher. The teachers often fail to show up for work. \r\n[L2671] Here is an idea for improving attendance: give the \r\n[L2672] teacher a digital camera with a tamperproof time \r\n[L2673] and date stamp and ask a student to take a photo of \r\n[L2674] the teacher and class at the beginning and end of the \r\n[L2675] day. Offer the teacher better pay for good attendance, \r\n[L2676] verified by the photos. Will this work? Researchers \r\n[L2677] obtained permission to use 120 rural schools in \r\n[L2678] Rajasthan for an experiment to find out.37\r\n[L2679] (a) Explain why it would not be a good idea to offer \r\n[L2680] better pay for good attendance to the teachers in all \r\n[L2681] 120 schools and then to compare this year\u2019s atten\ufffedance with last year\u2019s.\r\n[L2682] (b) Write a few sentences describing how you would \r\n[L2683] design this experiment.\r\n[L2684] 65. Stronger players A football coach hears that a new \r\n[L2685] exercise program will increase upper-body strength \r\n[L2686] better than lifting weights. He is eager to test this new \r\n[L2687] program in the off-season with the players on his high \r\n[L2688] school team. The coach decides to let his players \r\n[L2689] choose which of the two treatments they will undergo \r\n[L2690] for 3 weeks\u2014exercise or weight lifting. He will use \r\n[L2691] the number of push-ups a player can do at the end of \r\n[L2692] the experiment as the response variable.\r\n[L2693] (a) Which principle of experimental design does the \r\n[L2694] coach\u2019s plan violate?

The effects of day care Does day care help low\ufffeincome children stay in school and hold good jobs \r\n[L2712] later in life? The Carolina Abecedarian Project (the \r\n[L2713] name suggests the ABCs) has followed a group of \r\n[L2714] 111 children since 1972. Back then, these individu\ufffeals were all healthy but low-income black infants in \r\n[L2715] Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All the infants received \r\n[L2716] nutritional supplements and help from social workers. \r\n[L2717] Half were also assigned at random to an intensive \r\n[L2718] preschool program.38\r\n[L2719] (a) Explain the purpose of each of the three experi\ufffemental design principles.\r\n[L2720] (b) Describe how each of these principles was used \r\n[L2721] in this study.\r\n[L2722] 68. Killing weeds A biologist would like to determine \r\n[L2723] which of two brands of weed killer is less likely to \r\n[L2724] harm the plants in a garden at the university. Before \r\n[L2725] spraying near the plants, the biologist decides to \r\n[L2726] conduct an experiment using 24 individual plants. \r\n[L2727] Which of the following two plans for randomly \r\n[L2728] assigning the treatments should the biologist use? \r\n[L2729] Why?\r\n[L2730] Plan A: Choose the 12 healthiest-looking plants. \r\n[L2731] Apply Brand X weed killer to all 12 of those plants. \r\n[L2732] Apply Brand Y weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2733] Plan B: Choose 12 of the 24 plants at random. Apply \r\n[L2734] Brand X weed killer to those 12 plants and Brand Y \r\n[L2735] weed killer to the remaining 12 plants.\r\n[L2736] 69. Do placebos really work? Researchers in Japan \r\n[L2737] conducted an experiment on 13 individuals who \r\n[L2738] were extremely allergic to poison ivy. On one arm, \r\n[L2739] each subject was rubbed with a poison ivy leaf and \r\n[L2740] told the leaf was harmless. On the other arm, each \r\n[L2741] subject was rubbed with a harmless leaf and told it \r\n[L2742] was poison ivy. All the subjects developed a rash on \r\n[L2743] the arm where the harmless leaf was rubbed. Of the \r\n[L2744] 13 subjects, 11 did not have any reaction to the real \r\n[L2745] poison ivy leaf.39\r\n[L2746] (a) What was the placebo in this experiment?\r\n[L2747] (b) Explain how the results of this study support the \r\n[L2748] idea of a placebo effect.\r\n[L2749] 70. Pain relief study Fizz Laboratories, a pharmaceuti\ufffecal company, has developed a new drug for relieving \r\n[L2750] chronic pain. Sixty patients suffering from arthritis \r\n[L2751] and needing pain relief are available. Each patient \r\n[L2752] will be treated and asked an hour later, \u201cAbout what \r\n[L2753] percent of pain relief did you experience?\u201d\r\n[L2754] (a) Why should Fizz not simply administer the new \r\n[L2755] drug and record the patients\u2019 responses?\r\n[L2756] (b) Should the patients be told whether they are \r\n[L2757] getting the new drug or a placebo? How would this \r\n[L2758] knowledge probably affect their reactions?\r\n[L2759] 71. Meditation for anxiety An experiment that claimed \r\n[L2760] to show that meditation lowers anxiety proceeded as \r\n[L2761] follows. The experimenter interviewed the subjects \r\n[L2762] and rated their level of anxiety. Then the subjects \r\n[L2763] were randomly assigned to two groups. The experi\ufffementer taught one group how to meditate and they \r\n[L2764] meditated daily for a month. The other group was \r\n[L2765] simply told to relax more. At the end of the month, \r\n[L2766] the experimenter interviewed all the subjects again \r\n[L2767] and rated their anxiety level. The meditation group \r\n[L2768] now had less anxiety. Psychologists said that the re\ufffesults were suspect because the ratings were not blind. \r\n[L2769] Explain what this means and how lack of blindness \r\n[L2770] could bias the reported results.\r\n[L2771] 72. Testosterone for older men As men age, their \r\n[L2772] testosterone levels gradually decrease. This may \r\n[L2773] cause a reduction in lean body mass, an increase in \r\n[L2774] fat, and other undesirable changes. Do testosterone \r\n[L2775] supplements reverse some of these effects? A study \r\n[L2776] in the Netherlands assigned 237 men aged 60 to 80 \r\n[L2777] with low or low-normal testosterone levels to either \r\n[L2778] a testosterone supplement or a placebo. The report \r\n[L2779] in the Journal of the American Medical Association\r\n[L2780] described the study as a \u201cdouble-blind, randomized, \r\n[L2781] placebo-controlled trial.\u201d40 Explain each of these \r\n[L2782] terms to someone who knows no statistics.\r\n[L2783] 73. Acupuncture and pregnancy A study sought to \r\n[L2784] determine whether the ancient Chinese art of \r\n[L2785] acupuncture could help infertile women become \r\n[L2786] pregnant.41 One hundred sixty healthy women \r\n[L2787] undergoing treatment with artificial insemination \r\n[L2788] were recruited for the study. Half of the subjects were \r\n[L2789] randomly assigned to receive acupuncture treatment \r\n[L2790] 25 minutes before embryo transfer and again 25 \r\n[L2791] minutes after the transfer. The remaining 80 subjects \r\n[L2792] were instructed to lie still for 25 minutes after the \r\n[L2793] embryo transfer. Results: In the acupuncture group, \r\n[L2794] 34 women became pregnant. In the control group, \r\n[L2795] 21 women became pregnant.\r\n[L2796] (a) Describe how the three principles of experimen\ufffetal design were addressed in this study.\r\n[L2797] (b) The difference in the percent of women who \r\n[L2798] became pregnant in the two groups is statistically \r\n[L2799] significant. Explain what this means to someone who \r\n[L2800] knows little statistics.\r\n[L2801] (c) Explain why the placebo effect prevents us from \r\n[L2802] concluding that acupuncture caused the difference in \r\n[L2803] pregnancy rates.\r\n[L2804] pg 241","[L2805] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>","[L2806] Section 4.2 Experiments 257\r\n[L2807] 74. Do reducing diets work? Dr. Linda Stern and her \r\n[L2808] colleagues recruited 132 obese adults at the Philadel\ufffephia Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pennsylvania. \r\n[L2809] Half of the participants were randomly assigned \r\n[L2810] to a low-carbohydrate diet and the other half were \r\n[L2811] assigned to a low-fat diet. Researchers measured each \r\n[L2812] participant\u2019s change in weight and cholesterol level \r\n[L2813] after six months and again after one year. Subjects in \r\n[L2814] the low-carb diet group lost significantly more weight \r\n[L2815] than subjects in the low-fat diet group during the first \r\n[L2816] six months of the study. At the end of a year, however, \r\n[L2817] the average weight loss for subjects in the two groups \r\n[L2818] was not significantly different.42\r\n[L2819] (a) Why did researchers randomly assign the subjects \r\n[L2820] to the diet treatments?\r\n[L2821] (b) Explain to someone who knows little statistics \r\n[L2822] what \u201clost significantly more weight\u201d means.\r\n[L2823] (c) The subjects in the low-carb diet group lost an aver\ufffeage of 5.1 kg in a year.

Explain how this infor\ufffemation could be consistent with the fact that weight loss \r\n[L2825] in the two groups was not significantly different.\r\n[L2826] 75. Is yawning contagious? According to the popular \r\n[L2827] TV show Mythbusters, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d In the \r\n[L2828] March 9, 2005, episode, the Mythbusters team \r\n[L2829] presented the results of an experiment involving 50 \r\n[L2830] subjects. All the subjects were placed in a booth for \r\n[L2831] an extended period of time and monitored by hidden \r\n[L2832] camera. Two-thirds of the subjects were given a \u201cyawn \r\n[L2833] seed\u201d by one of the experimenters; that is, the experi\ufffementer yawned in the subject\u2019s presence prior to leav\ufffeing the room. The remaining subjects were given no \r\n[L2834] yawn seed. What were the results? Of the 16 subjects \r\n[L2835] who had no yawn seed, 4 yawned. Of the 34 subjects \r\n[L2836] given a yawn seed, 10 yawned.

The researchers decided to \r\n[L2846] analyze the patients\u2019 final pain ratings. It also makes \r\n[L2847] sense to examine the difference between patients\u2019 \r\n[L2848] initial pain ratings and their final pain ratings in both \r\n[L2849] groups. Here are the data:\r\n[L2850] Active: 10, 6, 1, 10, 6, 8, 5, 5, 6, 8, 7, 8, 7, 6, 4, 4, 7, 10, 6, 10, 6, 5, 5, 1, \r\n[L2851] 0, 0, 0, 0, 1\r\n[L2852] Inactive: 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1\r\n[L2853] (a) Construct a comparative dotplot of the data. \r\n[L2854] Describe what you see.\r\n[L2855] (b) Calculate the mean (average) change in pain \r\n[L2856] rating for each group.

Doctors and nurses Nurse-practitioners are nurses \r\n[L2864] with advanced qualifications who often act much like \r\n[L2865] primary-care physicians. Are they as effective as \r\n[L2866] doctors at treating patients with chronic conditions? \r\n[L2867] An experiment was conducted with 1316 patients \r\n[L2868] who had been diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, or \r\n[L2869] high blood pressure. Within each condition, patients \r\n[L2870] were randomly assigned to either a doctor or a \r\n[L2871] nurse-practitioner. The response variables included \r\n[L2872] measures of the patients\u2019 health and of their \r\n[L2873] satisfaction with their medical care after 6 months.43\r\n[L2874] (a) Which are the blocks in this experiment: the \r\n[L2875] different diagnoses (asthma, etc.) or the type of care \r\n[L2876] (nurse or doctor)? Why?\r\n[L2877] (b) Explain why a randomized block design is \r\n[L2878] preferable to a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2879] setting.\r\n[L2880] 78. Comparing cancer treatments The progress of a \r\n[L2881] type of cancer differs in women and men. Researchers \r\n[L2882] want to design an experiment to compare three thera\ufffepies for this cancer. They recruit 500 male and 300 \r\n[L2883] female patients who are willing to serve as subjects.","[L2884] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 53 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://4bf0dd1d3947b7c#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_52.jpg","size_bytes":68003,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L2885] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 54 / 75>","[L2886] 258 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L2887] (a) Which are the blocks in this experiment: the \r\n[L2888] cancer therapies or the two sexes?

In the cornfield An agriculture researcher wants to \r\n[L2895] compare the yield of 5 corn varieties: A, B, C, D, and \r\n[L2896] E. The field in which the experiment will be carried \r\n[L2897] out increases in fertility from north to south. The \r\n[L2898] researcher therefore divides the field into 25 plots \r\n[L2899] of equal size, arranged in 5 east\u2013west rows of 5 plots \r\n[L2900] each, as shown in the diagram.\r\n[L2901] North\r\n[L2902] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2903] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2904] setting.\r\n[L2905] (b) Should the researcher use the rows or the \r\n[L2906] columns of the field as blocks?

Comparing weight-loss treatments Twenty over\ufffeweight females have agreed to participate in a study \r\n[L2911] of the effectiveness of four weight-loss treatments: \r\n[L2912] A, B, C, and D. The researcher first calculates how \r\n[L2913] overweight each subject is by comparing the subject\u2019s \r\n[L2914] actual weight with her \u201cideal\u201d weight. The subjects \r\n[L2915] and their excess weights in pounds are as follows:\r\n[L2916] Birnbaum 35 Hernandez 25 Moses 25 Smith 29\r\n[L2917] Brown 34 Jackson 33 Nevesky 39 Stall 33\r\n[L2918] Brunk 30 Kendall 28 Obrach 30 Tran 35\r\n[L2919] Cruz 34 Loren 32 Rodriguez 30 Wilansky 42\r\n[L2920] Deng 24 Mann 28 Santiago 27 Williams 22\r\n[L2921] The response variable is the weight lost after 8 weeks of \r\n[L2922] treatment. Previous studies have shown that the effects \r\n[L2923] of a diet may vary based on a subject\u2019s initial weight.\r\n[L2924] (a) Explain why a randomized block design would be \r\n[L2925] better than a completely randomized design in this \r\n[L2926] setting.\r\n[L2927] (b) Should researchers form blocks of size 4 based on \r\n[L2928] subjects\u2019 last names in alphabetical order or by how \r\n[L2929] overweight the subjects are?

A nutrition experimenter intends to \r\n[L2934] compare the weight gain of newly weaned male \r\n[L2935] rats fed Diet A with that of rats fed Diet B. To do this, \r\n[L2936] she will feed each diet to 10 rats. She has available \r\n[L2937] 10 rats from one litter and 10 rats from a second \r\n[L2938] litter. Rats in the first litter appear to be slightly \r\n[L2939] healthier.\r\n[L2940] (a) If the 10 rats from Litter 1 were fed Diet A, the \r\n[L2941] effects of genetics and diet would be confounded, and \r\n[L2942] the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A. \r\n[L2943] Explain this statement carefully.\r\n[L2944] (b) Describe a better design for this experiment.\r\n[L2945] 82. Technology for teaching statistics The Brigham \r\n[L2946] Young University (BYU) statistics department is \r\n[L2947] performing experiments to compare teaching meth\ufffeods. Response variables include students\u2019 final-exam \r\n[L2948] scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. \r\n[L2949] One study compares two levels of technology for large \r\n[L2950] lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) \r\n[L2951] and multimedia. There are 8 lecture sections of a \r\n[L2952] basic statistics course at BYU, each with about 200 \r\n[L2953] students. There are four instructors, each of whom \r\n[L2954] teaches two sections.44 Suppose the sections and \r\n[L2955] lecturers are as follows:\r\n[L2956] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2957] 1 Hilton\r\n[L2958] 2 Christensen\r\n[L2959] 3 Hadfield\r\n[L2960] 4 Hadfield\r\n[L2961] Section Lecturer\r\n[L2962] 5 Tolley\r\n[L2963] 6 Hilton\r\n[L2964] 7 Tolley\r\n[L2965] 8 Christensen\r\n[L2966] (a) Suppose we randomly assign two lecturers to use \r\n[L2967] standard technology in their sections and the other \r\n[L2968] two lecturers to use multimedia technology.

Chocolate gets my heart pumping Cardiologists \r\n[L3000] at Athens Medical School in Greece wanted to test \r\n[L3001] whether chocolate affected blood flow in the blood \r\n[L3002] vessels. The researchers recruited 17 healthy young \r\n[L3003] volunteers, who were each given a 3.5-ounce bar of \r\n[L3004] dark chocolate, either bittersweet or fake chocolate. \r\n[L3005] On another day, the volunteers were switched. The \r\n[L3006] subjects had no chocolate outside the study, and \r\n[L3007] investigators didn\u2019t know whether a subject had eaten \r\n[L3008] the real or the fake chocolate. An ultrasound was \r\n[L3009] taken of each volunteer\u2019s upper arm to see the func\ufffetioning of the cells in the walls of the main artery. \r\n[L3010] The investigators found that blood vessel function was \r\n[L3011] improved when the subjects ate bittersweet chocolate, \r\n[L3012] and that there were no such changes when they ate \r\n[L3013] the placebo (fake chocolate).45\r\n[L3014] (a) What type of design did the investigators use in \r\n[L3015] their study?\r\n[L3016] (b) Explain why the investigators chose this design \r\n[L3017] instead of a completely randomized design.\r\n[L3018] (c) Why is it important to randomly assign the order \r\n[L3019] of the treatments for the subjects?\r\n[L3020] 85. Room temperature and dexterity An expert on \r\n[L3021] worker performance is interested in the effect of \r\n[L3022] room temperature on the performance of tasks \r\n[L3023] requiring manual dexterity. She chooses tempera\ufffetures of 70\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F as treatments. The response \r\n[L3024] variable is the number of correct insertions, during \r\n[L3025] a 30-minute period, in a peg-and-hole apparatus that \r\n[L3026] requires the use of both hands simultaneously. Each \r\n[L3027] subject is trained on the apparatus and then asked to \r\n[L3028] make as many insertions as possible in 30 minutes of \r\n[L3029] continuous effort.\r\n[L3030] (a) Outline a completely randomized design to \r\n[L3031] compare dexterity at 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Twenty subjects are \r\n[L3032] available.\r\n[L3033] (b) Because individuals differ greatly in dexterity, the \r\n[L3034] wide variation in individual scores may hide the sys\ufffetematic effect of temperature unless there are many \r\n[L3035] subjects in each group. Describe in detail the design \r\n[L3036] of a matched pairs experiment in which each subject \r\n[L3037] serves as his or her own control.\r\n[L3038] 86. Carbon dioxide and tree growth The concentration \r\n[L3039] of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is \r\n[L3040] increasing rapidly due to our use of fossil fuels. \r\n[L3041] Because plants use CO2 to fuel photosynthesis, more \r\n[L3042] CO2 may cause trees and other plants to grow faster. \r\n[L3043] An elaborate apparatus allows researchers to pipe extra \r\n[L3044] CO2 to a 30-meter circle of forest. We want to compare \r\n[L3045] the growth in base area of trees in treated and \r\n[L3046] untreated areas to see if extra CO2 does in fact increase \r\n[L3047] growth. We can afford to treat three circular areas.46\r\n[L3048] (a) Describe the design of a completely randomized \r\n[L3049] experiment using 6 well-separated 30-meter circular \r\n[L3050] areas in a pine forest.

Separate by \r\n[L3061] gender, since male and female bodies might respond \r\n[L3062] differently to deodorant. Give all the males Brand A \r\n[L3063] deodorant and all the females Brand B. Have each \r\n[L3064] student rate how well the deodorant is still working \r\n[L3065] at the end of the school day on a 0 to 10 scale. Then \r\n[L3066] compare ratings for the two treatments.\r\n[L3067] (a) Identify any flaws you see in the proposed design \r\n[L3068] for this experiment.\r\n[L3069] (b) Describe how you would design the experiment. \r\n[L3070] Explain how your design addresses each of the \r\n[L3071] problems you identified in (a).\r\n[L3072] 88.

Can changing diet reduce high blood pressure? \r\n[L3098] Vegetarian diets and low-salt diets are both promising. \r\n[L3099] Men with high blood pressure are assigned at random \r\n[L3100] to four diets: (1) normal diet with unrestricted salt; \r\n[L3101] (2) vegetarian with unrestricted salt; (3) normal with \r\n[L3102] restricted salt; and (4) vegetarian with restricted salt. \r\n[L3103] This experiment has\r\n[L3104] (a) one factor, the type of diet.\r\n[L3105] (b) two factors, high blood pressure and type of diet.\r\n[L3106] (c) two factors, normal/vegetarian diet and unre\ufffestricted/restricted salt.\r\n[L3107] (d) three factors, men, high blood pressure, and type \r\n[L3108] of diet.\r\n[L3109] (e) four factors, the four diets being compared.\r\n[L3110] 92.

In each case, one twin \r\n[L3198] (Twin A) was adopted by a low-income family and the \r\n[L3199] other (Twin B) by a high-income family. Both twins were \r\n[L3200] given an IQ test as adults.

Here are two examples.\r\n[L3219] sThe U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly Current Population Survey of \r\n[L3220] about 60,000 households. Their goal is to use data from these randomly selected \r\n[L3221] households to estimate the percent of unemployed individuals in the population.\r\n[L3222] sScientists performed an experiment that randomly assigned 21 volunteer sub\ufffejects to one of two treatments: sleep deprivation for one night or unrestricted \r\n[L3223] sleep. The experimenters hoped to show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease \r\n[L3224] in performance two days later.48\r\n[L3225] What type of inference can be made from a particular study? The answer depends \r\n[L3226] on the design of the study.\r\n[L3227] Scope of Inference\r\n[L3228] In the Census Bureau\u2019s sample survey, the individuals who responded were cho\ufffesen at random from the population of interest. Random sampling avoids bias and \r\n[L3229] produces trustworthy estimates of the truth about the population. The Census \r\n[L3230] Bureau should be safe making an inference about the population based on the \r\n[L3231] results of the sample.\r\n[L3232] In the sleep deprivation experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to the \r\n[L3233] sleep deprivation and unrestricted sleep treatments. Random assignment helps \r\n[L3234] ensure that the two groups of subjects are as similar as possible before the treat\ufffements are imposed. If the unrestricted sleep group performs much better than \r\n[L3235] the sleep deprivation group, and the difference is too large to be explained by \r\n[L3236] chance variation in the random assignment, it must be due to the treatments. In \r\n[L3237] that case, the scientists could safely conclude that sleep deprivation caused the \r\n[L3238] decrease in performance. That is, they can make an inference about cause and \r\n[L3239] effect. However, since the experiment used volunteer subjects, this limits scien\ufffetists\u2019 ability to generalize their findings to some larger population of individuals.\r\n[L3240] 4.3\r\n[L3241] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 261","[L3242] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 57 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a3c788800e33990#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_56.jpg","size_bytes":66959,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3243] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>","[L3244] 262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3245] Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study. \r\n[L3246] Random selection of individuals allows inference about the population. Random \r\n[L3247] assignment of individuals to groups permits inference about cause and effect. The \r\n[L3248] chart below summarizes the possibilities.49\r\n[L3249] Were individuals randomly assigned to groups?\r\n[L3250] Yes No\r\n[L3251] Were individuals \r\n[L3252] randomly selected?\r\n[L3253] Yes\r\n[L3254] Inference about the population: YES Inference about the population: YES\r\n[L3255] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3256] No Inference about the population: NO Inference about the population: NO\r\n[L3257] Inference about cause and effect: YES Inference about cause and effect: NO\r\n[L3258] Well-designed experiments randomly assign individuals to treatment groups. \r\n[L3259] However, most experiments don\u2019t select experimental units at random from the \r\n[L3260] larger population. That limits such experiments to inference about cause and \r\n[L3261] effect. Observational studies don\u2019t randomly assign individuals to groups, which \r\n[L3262] rules out inference about cause and effect. An observational study that uses \r\n[L3263] random sampling can make an inference about the population. The following \r\n[L3264] example illustrates all four cases from the table above in a single setting.\r\n[L3265] EXAMPLE Vitamin C and Canker Sores\r\n[L3266] Determining scope of inference\r\n[L3267] A small-town dentist wants to know if a daily dose of 500 milligrams (mg) of vita\ufffemin C will result in fewer canker sores in the mouth than taking no vitamin C.50\r\n[L3268] The dentist is considering the following four study designs.\r\n[L3269] Design 1: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3270] to take part in a study. Give each patient a survey with two questions: (1) Do you \r\n[L3271] take at least 500 mg of vitamin C each day? (2) Do you frequently have canker \r\n[L3272] sores? Based on patients\u2019 answers to Question 1, divide them into two groups: \r\n[L3273] those who take at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily and those who don\u2019t.\r\n[L3274] Design 2: Get all dental patients in town with appointments in the next two weeks \r\n[L3275] to take part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin \r\n[L3276] C each day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3277] Design 3: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3278] part in a study. Divide the patients into two groups as in Design 1.\r\n[L3279] Design 4: Select a random sample of dental patients in town and get them to take \r\n[L3280] part in a study. Randomly assign half of them to take 500 mg of vitamin C each \r\n[L3281] day and the other half to abstain from taking vitamin C for three months.\r\n[L3282] For whichever design the dentist chooses, suppose she compares the proportion \r\n[L3283] of patients in each group who complain of canker sores. Also suppose that she \r\n[L3284] finds a statistically significant difference, with a smaller proportion of those taking \r\n[L3285] vitamin C having canker sores.\r\n[L3286] PROBLEM: What can the dentist conclude for each design?\r\n[L3287] SOLUTION:\r\n[L3288] Design 1: Since the patients were not randomly selected, the dentist cannot infer that this result \r\n[L3289] holds for a larger population of dental patients. This was an observational study since no treatments ","[L3290] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 58 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a9a2c4c5c24a51b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_57.jpg","size_bytes":59616,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3291] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>","[L3292] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 263\r\n[L3293] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3294] were deliberately imposed on the patients. With no random assignment to the two groups, no \r\n[L3295] inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist just knows that for these patients, those \r\n[L3296] who took vitamin C had fewer canker sores than those who didn\u2019t.\r\n[L3297] Design 2: As in Design 1, the dentist can\u2019t make any inference about this result holding for a larger \r\n[L3298] population of dental patients. However, the treatments were randomly assigned to the subjects. \r\n[L3299] Assuming proper control in the experiment, she can conclude that taking vitamin C reduced the \r\n[L3300] chance of getting canker sores in her subjects.\r\n[L3301] Design 3: Since the patients were randomly selected from the population of dental patients in the \r\n[L3302] town, the dentist can generalize the results of this study to the population. Because this was an \r\n[L3303] observational study, no inference about cause and effect can be made. The dentist would conclude \r\n[L3304] that for the population of dental patients in this town, those taking vitamin C have fewer canker \r\n[L3305] sores than those who don\u2019t. She can\u2019t say whether the vitamin C causes this reduction or some other \r\n[L3306] confounding variable. (Note that the dentist can\u2019t draw a conclusion about whether those people in \r\n[L3307] the general population of the town who take vitamin C will have fewer canker sores, since the sample \r\n[L3308] was only of dental patients.)\r\n[L3309] Design 4: As in Design 3, the random sampling allows the dentist to generalize the results of this \r\n[L3310] study to the population of dental patients in the town. As in Design 2, the random assignment would \r\n[L3311] allow her to conclude (assuming proper control in the experiment) that taking vitamin C reduced \r\n[L3312] the chance of getting canker sores. So the dentist would conclude that for the population of dental \r\n[L3313] patients in this town, those taking vitamin C will tend to have fewer canker sores than those who \r\n[L3314] don\u2019t due to the vitamin C. As with Design 3, she can\u2019t extend this result to the general population of \r\n[L3315] the town.\r\n[L3316] The Challenges of \r\n[L3317] Establishing Causation\r\n[L3318] A well-designed experiment tells us that changes in the explanatory variable cause \r\n[L3319] changes in the response variable. More precisely, it tells us that this happened \r\n[L3320] for specific individuals in the specific environment of this specific experiment. \r\n[L3321] The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our \r\n[L3322] experiment may not be realistic. Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the \r\n[L3323] conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest.\r\n[L3324] Do Center Brake Lights Reduce Rear-End Crashes?\r\n[L3325] Lack of realism\r\n[L3326] Do those high center brake lights, required on all cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3327] since 1986, really reduce rear-end collisions? Randomized comparative experi\ufffements with fleets of rental and business cars, done before the lights were required, \r\n[L3328] showed that the third brake light reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. \r\n[L3329] But requiring the third light in all cars led to only a 5% drop.\r\n[L3330] What happened? Most cars did not have the extra brake light when the experi\ufffements were carried out, so it caught the eye of following drivers. Now that almost \r\n[L3331] all cars have the third light, they no longer capture attention.\r\n[L3332] For Practice Try Exercise 105","[L3333] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 59 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a8565319fb9519b#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_58.jpg","size_bytes":57820,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3334] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>","[L3335] 264 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3336] EXAMPLE\r\n[L3337] In some cases, it isn\u2019t practical or even ethical to do an experiment. Consider \r\n[L3338] these important questions:\r\n[L3339] sDoes texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident?\r\n[L3340] sDoes going to church regularly help people live longer?\r\n[L3341] sDoes smoking cause lung cancer?\r\n[L3342] To answer these cause-and-effect questions, we just need to perform a randomized \r\n[L3343] comparative experiment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t randomly assign people to text \r\n[L3344] while driving or to attend church or to smoke cigarettes. The best data we have \r\n[L3345] about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational \r\n[L3346] studies.\r\n[L3347] It is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of \r\n[L3348] experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as \r\n[L3349] nonexperimental evidence can be.\r\n[L3350] Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?\r\n[L3351] Living with observational studies\r\n[L3352] Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. \r\n[L3353] Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong asso\ufffeciation between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association \r\n[L3354] be due to a lurking variable? Is there some genetic factor that makes people \r\n[L3355] both more likely to get addicted to nicotine and to develop lung cancer? If \r\n[L3356] so, then smoking and lung cancer would be strongly associated even if \r\n[L3357] smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or maybe confounding is to \r\n[L3358] blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, \r\n[L3359] alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smok\ufffeing is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?\r\n[L3360] What are the criteria for establishing causation when we can\u2019t do an \r\n[L3361] experiment?\r\n[L3362] sThe association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is \r\n[L3363] very strong.\r\n[L3364] sThe association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many \r\n[L3365] countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking \r\n[L3366] variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.\r\n[L3367] sLarger values of the explanatory variable are associated with stronger responses.\r\n[L3368] People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period \r\n[L3369] get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.\r\n[L3370] sThe alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years \r\n[L3371] of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became \r\n[L3372] more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than \r\n[L3373] any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women \r\n[L3374] began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a \r\n[L3375] lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of \r\n[L3376] cancer death among women.","[L3377] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 60 / 75>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://45487c2257a52a0#file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70#p_59.jpg","size_bytes":56859,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L3378] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 61 / 75>","[L3379] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 265\r\n[L3380] sThe alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from \r\n[L3381] cigarette smoke do cause cancer.\r\n[L3382] Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. \r\n[L3383] The U.S. Surgeon General states that cigarette smoking is \u201cthe largest avoidable \r\n[L3384] cause of death and disability in the United States.\u201d51 The evidence for causation is \r\n[L3385] overwhelming\u2014but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed \r\n[L3386] experiments. Conducting an experiment in which some subjects were forced \r\n[L3387] to smoke and others were not allowed to would be unethical. In cases like this, \r\n[L3388] observational studies are our best source of reliable information.\r\n[L3389] Data Ethics*\r\n[L3390] Medical professionals are taught to follow the basic principle \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d \r\n[L3391] Shouldn\u2019t those who carry out statistical studies follow the same principle? Most \r\n[L3392] reasonable people think so. But this may not always be as simple as it sounds. De\ufffecide whether you think each of the following studies is ethical or unethical.\r\n[L3393] sA promising new drug has been developed for treating cancer in humans. \r\n[L3394] Before giving the drug to human subjects, researchers want to administer the \r\n[L3395] drug to animals to see if there are any potentially serious side effects.\r\n[L3396] sAre companies discriminating against some individuals in the hiring process? \r\n[L3397] To find out, researchers prepare several equivalent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for fictitious job \r\n[L3398] applicants, with the only difference being the gender of the applicant. They \r\n[L3399] send the fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies advertising positions and keep track of the \r\n[L3400] number of males and females who are contacted for interviews.\r\n[L3401] sIn a medical study of a new drug for migraine sufferers, volunteer subjects are \r\n[L3402] randomly assigned to two groups. Members of the first group are given a placebo \r\n[L3403] pill. Subjects in the second group are given the new drug. None of the subjects \r\n[L3404] knows whether they are taking a placebo or the active drug. Neither do any of \r\n[L3405] the physicians who are interacting with the subjects.\r\n[L3406] sWill people try to stop someone from driving drunk? A television news pro\ufffegram hires an actor to play a drunk driver and uses a hidden camera to record the \r\n[L3407] behavior of individuals who encounter the driver.\r\n[L3408] The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. \r\n[L3409] The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment \r\n[L3410] on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new \r\n[L3411] medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here \r\n[L3412] are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by all studies that gather \r\n[L3413] data from human subjects, both observational studies and experiments.\r\n[L3414] Basic Data Ethics\r\n[L3415] All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an institutional review \r\n[L3416] board charged with protecting the safety and well-being of the subjects.\r\n[L3417] All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent\r\n[L3418] before data are collected.\r\n[L3419] All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for \r\n[L3420] groups of subjects may be made public.\r\n[L3421] *This is an important topic, but it is not required for the AP Statistics exam.","[L3422] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 62 / 75>","[L3423] 266 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L3424] The law requires that studies carried out or funded by the federal government \r\n[L3425] obey these principles.52 But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is com\ufffepletely clear about the details of their application.\r\n[L3426] Institutional review boards The purpose of an institutional review board is not \r\n[L3427] to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether \r\n[L3428] it is statistically sound. The board\u2019s purpose is, in the words of one university\u2019s \r\n[L3429] board, \u201cto protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) \r\n[L3430] recruited to participate in research activities.\u201d The board reviews the plan of the \r\n[L3431] study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects \r\n[L3432] are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once \r\n[L3433] research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.\r\n[L3434] The Web page of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s institutional review board. It begins by describing the job of such \r\n[L3435] boards.\r\n[L3436] Informed consent Both words in the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d are important, \r\n[L3437] and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the \r\n[L3438] nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample sur\ufffevey, physical harm is not possible. But a survey on sensitive issues could result \r\n[L3439] in emotional harm. The participants should be told what kinds of questions the \r\n[L3440] survey will ask and about how much of their time it will \r\n[L3441] take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and \r\n[L3442] purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects \r\n[L3443] must then consent in writing.\r\n[L3444] Confidentiality Ethical problems do not disappear \r\n[L3445] once a study has been cleared by the review board, has \r\n[L3446] obtained consent from its participants, and has actually \r\n[L3447] collected data about them. It is important to protect in\ufffedividuals\u2019 privacy by keeping all data about them con\ufffefidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what \r\n[L3448] percent of the 1200 respondents felt that legal immigra\ufffetion should be reduced. It may not report what you said \r\n[L3449] about this or any other issue.\r\n[L3450] Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity.

Inference about the population requires that the \r\n[L3496] individuals taking part in a study be randomly selected from the larger \r\n[L3497] population. A well-designed experiment that randomly assigns treatments \r\n[L3498] to experimental units allows inference about cause and effect.\r\n[L3499] s Lack of realism in an experiment can prevent us from generalizing its \r\n[L3500] results.\r\n[L3501] s In the absence of an experiment, good evidence of causation requires \r\n[L3502] a strong association that appears consistently in many studies, a clear \r\n[L3503] explanation for the alleged causal link, and careful examination of possible \r\n[L3504] lurking variables.\r\n[L3505] s Studies involving humans must be screened in advance by an institutional\r\n[L3506] review board. All participants must give their informed consent before \r\n[L3507] taking part. Any information about the individuals in the study must be \r\n[L3508] kept confidential.\r\n[L3509] s Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions \r\n[L3510] that can\u2019t be answered without them. Also remember that \u201cthe interests of \r\n[L3511] the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\u201d54\r\n[L3512] Summary SECTION 4.3\r\n[L3513] Magnets and Pain\r\n[L3514] Let\u2019s return to the chapter-opening Case Study (page 205). Researchers carried \r\n[L3515] out an experiment using as subjects 50 volunteer patients with chronic pain. \r\n[L3516] A completely randomized design was used, with 29 subjects receiving the active\ufffemagnet treatment and 21 subjects getting the fake-magnet treatment. The Fathom \r\n[L3517] dotplot shows the final pain ratings for both groups (A = active magnet, I = inactive \r\n[L3518] magnet).\r\n[L3519] The average pain rating after the treatment was 8.43 for the inactive-magnet group \r\n[L3520] and 4.38 for the active-magnet group. This difference is statistically \r\n[L3521] significant. What conclusion can we draw?\r\n[L3522] The difference in the average responses for the two groups was \r\n[L3523] too large to be explained by chance variation in the random as\ufffesignment. So we can infer that the magnet treatment caused a re\ufffeduction in pain. But since the subjects were volunteers, we can\u2019t \r\n[L3524] safely generalize the findings of this experiment to any larger \r\n[L3525] population.\r\n[L3526] case closed","[L3527] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 65 / 75>","[L3528] Section 4.3 Using Studies Wisely 269\r\n[L3529] 102. Random sampling versus random assignment\r\n[L3530] Explain the difference between the types of \r\n[L3531] inference that can be made as a result of random \r\n[L3532] sampling and random assignment.\r\n[L3533] 103. Foster care versus orphanages Do abandoned \r\n[L3534] children placed in foster homes do better than \r\n[L3535] similar children placed in an institution? The \r\n[L3536] Bucharest Early Intervention Project found that \r\n[L3537] the answer is a clear \u201cYes.\u201d The subjects were 136 \r\n[L3538] young children abandoned at birth and living in \r\n[L3539] orphanages in Bucharest, Romania. Half of the \r\n[L3540] children, chosen at random, were placed in foster \r\n[L3541] homes. The other half remained in the orphanages.55\r\n[L3542] (Foster care was not easily available in Romania at \r\n[L3543] the time and so was paid for by the study.) What \r\n[L3544] conclusion can we draw from this study? Explain.\r\n[L3545] 104. Frozen batteries Will storing batteries in a freezer \r\n[L3546] make them last longer? To find out, a company that \r\n[L3547] produces batteries takes a random sample of 100 AA \r\n[L3548] batteries from its warehouse. The company \r\n[L3549] statistician randomly assigns 50 batteries to be stored \r\n[L3550] in the freezer and the other 50 to be stored at room \r\n[L3551] temperature for 3 years. At the end of that time \r\n[L3552] period, each battery\u2019s charge is tested. Result:\r\n[L3553] Batteries stored in the freezer had a higher average \r\n[L3554] charge, and the difference between the groups was \r\n[L3555] statistically significant. What conclusion can we \r\n[L3556] draw from this study? Explain.\r\n[L3557] 105. Who talks more\u2014women or men? According to \r\n[L3558] Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain,\r\n[L3559] women say nearly three times as many words per day \r\n[L3560] as men. Skeptical researchers devised a study to test \r\n[L3561] this claim. They used electronic devices to record \r\n[L3562] the talking patterns of 396 university students who \r\n[L3563] volunteered to participate in the study. The device \r\n[L3564] was programmed to record 30 seconds of sound \r\n[L3565] every 12.5 minutes without the carrier\u2019s knowledge. \r\n[L3566] According to a published report of the study in \r\n[L3567] Scientific American, \u201cMen showed a slightly wider \r\n[L3568] variability in words uttered.... But in the end, the \r\n[L3569] sexes came out just about even in the daily averages: \r\n[L3570] women at 16,215 words and men at 15,669.\u201d56 This \r\n[L3571] difference was not statistically significant. What \r\n[L3572] conclusion can we draw from this study? Explain.\r\n[L3573] 106. Attend church, live longer? One of the better \r\n[L3574] studies of the effect of regular attendance at religious \r\n[L3575] services gathered data from a random sample of \r\n[L3576] 3617 adults. The researchers then measured lots of \r\n[L3577] variables, not just the explanatory variable (religious \r\n[L3578] activities) and the response variable (length of life). \r\n[L3579] A news article said: \u201cChurchgoers were more likely \r\n[L3580] to be nonsmokers, physically active, and at their \r\n[L3581] right weight. But even after health behaviors were \r\n[L3582] taken into account, those not attending religious \r\n[L3583] services regularly still were about 25% more likely to \r\n[L3584] have died.\u201d57 What conclusion can we draw from \r\n[L3585] this study? Explain.\r\n[L3586] 107. Daytime running lights Canada requires that cars \r\n[L3587] be equipped with \u201cdaytime running lights,\u201d \r\n[L3588] headlights that automatically come on at a low \r\n[L3589] level when the car is started. Some manufacturers \r\n[L3590] are now equipping cars sold in the United States \r\n[L3591] with running lights. Will running lights reduce \r\n[L3592] accidents by making cars more visible? An \r\n[L3593] experiment conducted in a driving simulator \r\n[L3594] suggests that the answer may be \u201cYes.\u201d What \r\n[L3595] concerns would you have about generalizing the \r\n[L3596] results of such an experiment?\r\n[L3597] 108. Studying frustration A psychologist wants to study \r\n[L3598] the effects of failure and frustration on the \r\n[L3599] relationships among members of a work team. \r\n[L3600] She forms a team of students, brings them to the \r\n[L3601] psychology lab, and has them play a game that \r\n[L3602] requires teamwork. The game is rigged so that they \r\n[L3603] lose regularly. The psychologist observes the students \r\n[L3604] through a one-way window and notes the changes in \r\n[L3605] their behavior during an evening of game playing. \r\n[L3606] Can the psychologist generalize the results of her \r\n[L3607] study to a team of employees that spends months \r\n[L3608] developing a new product that never works right and \r\n[L3609] is finally abandoned by their company? Explain.\r\n[L3610] 109.* Minimal risk? You have been invited to serve on \r\n[L3611] a college\u2019s institutional review board. You must \r\n[L3612] decide whether several research proposals qualify for \r\n[L3613] lighter review because they involve only minimal \r\n[L3614] risk to subjects. Federal regulations say that \u201cminimal \r\n[L3615] risk\u201d means the risks are no greater than \u201cthose \r\n[L3616] ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the \r\n[L3617] performance of routine physical or psychological \r\n[L3618] examinations or tests.\u201d That\u2019s vague.

Government regulations require that \r\n[L3632] institutional review boards consist of at least five people, \r\n[L3633] including at least one scientist, one nonscientist, and \r\n[L3634] one person from outside the institution. Most boards \r\n[L3635] are larger, but many contain just one outsider.\r\n[L3636] (a) Why should review boards contain people who \r\n[L3637] are not scientists?\r\n[L3638] (b) Do you think that one outside member is \r\n[L3639] enough?

In which of the circumstances \r\n[L3642] below would you allow collecting personal \r\n[L3643] information without the subjects\u2019 consent?\r\n[L3644] (a) A government agency takes a random sample \r\n[L3645] of income tax returns to obtain information on the \r\n[L3646] average income of people in different occupations. \r\n[L3647] Only the incomes and occupations are recorded \r\n[L3648] from the returns, not the names.\r\n[L3649] (b) A social psychologist attends public meetings \r\n[L3650] of a religious group to study the behavior patterns\r\n[L3651] of members.\r\n[L3652] (c) A social psychologist pretends to be converted to \r\n[L3653] membership in a religious group and attends private \r\n[L3654] meetings to study the behavior patterns of members.\r\n[L3655] 112.* Surveys of youth A survey asked teenagers whether \r\n[L3656] they had ever consumed an alcoholic beverage. \r\n[L3657] Those who said \u201cYes\u201d were then asked, \u201cHow old \r\n[L3658] were you when you first consumed an alcoholic \r\n[L3659] beverage?\u201d Should consent of parents be required to \r\n[L3660] ask minors about alcohol, drugs, and other such \r\n[L3661] issues, or is consent of the minors themselves \r\n[L3662] enough? Give reasons for your opinion.\r\n[L3663] 113.*Anonymous? Confidential? One of the most impor\ufffetant nongovernment surveys in the United States is the \r\n[L3664] National Opinion Research Center\u2019s General Social \r\n[L3665] Survey. The GSS regularly monitors public opinion \r\n[L3666] on a wide variety of political and social issues. Inter\ufffeviews are conducted in person in the subject\u2019s home. \r\n[L3667] Are a subject\u2019s responses to GSS questions anonymous, \r\n[L3668] confidential, or both? Explain your answer.\r\n[L3669] 114.*Anonymous? Confidential? Texas A&M, like many \r\n[L3670] universities, offers screening for HIV, the virus that \r\n[L3671] causes AIDS. Students may choose either anonymous \r\n[L3672] *Exercises 109 to 116: This is an important topic, but it is not \r\n[L3673] required for the AP Statistics exam.\r\n[L3674] or confidential screening.

Does this describe the \r\n[L3679] anonymous or the confidential screening? Why?\r\n[L3680] 115.* The Willowbrook hepatitis studies In the 1960s, \r\n[L3681] children entering the Willowbrook State School, an \r\n[L3682] institution for the mentally retarded, were \r\n[L3683] deliberately infected with hepatitis. The researchers \r\n[L3684] argued that almost all children in the institution \r\n[L3685] quickly became infected anyway. The studies \r\n[L3686] showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis \r\n[L3687] existed. This finding contributed to the development \r\n[L3688] of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, \r\n[L3689] the Willowbrook studies are now considered an \r\n[L3690] example of unethical research. Explain why, \r\n[L3691] according to current ethical standards, useful results \r\n[L3692] are not enough to allow a study.\r\n[L3693] 116.* Unequal benefits Researchers on aging proposed to \r\n[L3694] investigate the effect of supplemental health services \r\n[L3695] on the quality of life of older people. Eligible \r\n[L3696] patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to \r\n[L3697] be randomly assigned to treatment and control \r\n[L3698] groups. The treatment group would be offered \r\n[L3699] hearing aids, dentures, transportation, and other \r\n[L3700] services not available without charge to the control \r\n[L3701] group. The review board felt that providing these \r\n[L3702] services to some but not other persons in the same \r\n[L3703] institution raised ethical questions. Do you agree?\r\n[L3704] 117. Animal testing (1.1) \u201cIt is right to use animals for \r\n[L3705] medical testing if it might save human lives.\u201d The \r\n[L3706] General Social Survey asked 1152 adults to react to this \r\n[L3707] statement.

Ugly fries Few people want to eat discolored \r\n[L3851] french fries. Potatoes are kept refrigerated before being \r\n[L3852] cut for french fries to prevent spoiling and preserve flavor. \r\n[L3853] But immediate processing of cold potatoes causes discol\ufffeoring due to complex chemical reactions. The potatoes \r\n[L3854] must therefore be brought to room temperature before \r\n[L3855] processing. Researchers want to design an experiment in \r\n[L3856] which tasters will rate the color and flavor of french fries \r\n[L3857] prepared from several groups of potatoes. The potatoes \r\n[L3858] will be freshly picked or stored for a month at room tem\ufffeperature or stored for a month refrigerated. They will then \r\n[L3859] be sliced and cooked either immediately or after an hour \r\n[L3860] at room temperature.

At the end of \r\n[L4151] each 2-day study period, subjects were evaluated using a \r\n[L4152] tapping task in which they were instructed to press a button \r\n[L4153] 200 times as fast as they could.66\r\n[L4154] (a) How and why was blocking used in the design of this \r\n[L4155] experiment?\r\n[L4156] (b) Why did researchers randomize the order in which \r\n[L4157] subjects received the two treatments?\r\n[L4158] (c) Could this experiment have been carried out in a \r\n[L4159] double-blind manner? Explain.\r\n[L4160] 276 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\r\n[L4161] AP1.1. You look at real estate ads for houses in Sarasota, \r\n[L4162] Florida. Many houses range from $200,000 to $400,000 in \r\n[L4163] price. The few houses on the water, however, have prices \r\n[L4164] up to $15 million. Which of the following statements best \r\n[L4165] describes the distribution of home prices in Sarasota?\r\n[L4166] (a) The distribution is most likely skewed to the left, and \r\n[L4167] the mean is greater than the median.\r\n[L4168] (b) The distribution is most likely skewed to the left, and \r\n[L4169] the mean is less than the median.\r\n[L4170] (c) The distribution is roughly symmetric with a few high \r\n[L4171] outliers, and the mean is approximately equal to the median.\r\n[L4172] (d) The distribution is most likely skewed to the right, and \r\n[L4173] the mean is greater than the median.\r\n[L4174] (e) The distribution is most likely skewed to the right, and \r\n[L4175] the mean is less than the median.\r\n[L4176] AP1.2. A child is 40 inches tall, which places her at the \r\n[L4177] 90th percentile of all children of similar age. The heights for \r\n[L4178] children of this age form an approximately Normal distribu\ufffetion with a mean of 38 inches. Based on this information, \r\n[L4179] what is the standard deviation of the heights of all children \r\n[L4180] of this age?\r\n[L4181] (a) 0.20 inches (c) 0.65 inches (e) 1.56 inches \r\n[L4182] (b) 0.31 inches (d) 1.21 inches\r\n[L4183] AP1.3. A large set of test scores has mean 60 and standard \r\n[L4184] deviation 18. If each score is doubled, and then 5 is sub\ufffetracted from the result, the mean and standard deviation of \r\n[L4185] the new scores are\r\n[L4186] (a) mean 115; std. dev. 31. (d) mean 120; std. dev. 31.\r\n[L4187] (b) mean 115; std. dev. 36. (e) mean 120; std. dev. 36.\r\n[L4188] (c) mean 120; std. dev. 6.\r\n[L4189] AP1.4. For a certain experiment, the available experimen\ufffetal units are eight rats, of which four are female (F1, F2, \r\n[L4190] F3, F4) and four are male (M1, M2, M3, M4). There are to \r\n[L4191] be four treatment groups, A, B, C, and D. If a randomized \r\n[L4192] block design is used, with the experimental units blocked \r\n[L4193] by gender, which of the following assignments of treat\ufffements is impossible?\r\n[L4194] (a) A \u2192 (F1, M1), B \u2192 (F2, M2),\r\n[L4195] C \u2192 (F3, M3), D \u2192 (F4, M4)\r\n[L4196] (b) A \u2192 (F1, M2), B \u2192 (F2, M3),\r\n[L4197] C \u2192 (F3, M4), D \u2192 (F4, M1)\r\n[L4198] (c) A \u2192 (F1, M2), B \u2192 (F3, F2),\r\n[L4199] C \u2192 (F4, M1), D \u2192 (M3, M4)\r\n[L4200] (d) A \u2192 (F4, M1), B \u2192 (F2, M3),\r\n[L4201] C \u2192 (F3, M2), D \u2192 (F1, M4)\r\n[L4202] (e) A \u2192 (F4, M1), B \u2192 (F1, M4),\r\n[L4203] C \u2192 (F3, M2), D \u2192 (F2, M3)\r\n[L4204] AP1.5. For a biology project, you measure the weight in\r\n[L4205] grams (g) and the tail length in millimeters (mm) of a \r\n[L4206] group of mice. The equation of the least-squares line for \r\n[L4207] predicting tail length from weight is\r\n[L4208] predicted tail length = 20 + 3 \u00d7 weight\r\n[L4209] Which of the following is not correct?\r\n[L4210] (a) The slope is 3, which indicates that a mouse\u2019s weight \r\n[L4211] should increase by about 3 grams for each additional mil\ufffelimeter of tail length.\r\n[L4212] (b) The predicted tail length of a mouse that weighs \r\n[L4213] 38 grams is 134 millimeters.\r\n[L4214] Cumulative AP Practice Test 1 \r\n[L4215] Section I: Multiple Choice Choose the best answer for Questions AP1.1 to AP1.14.","[L4216] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 73 / 75>","[L4217] Cumulative AP Practice Test 1 277\r\n[L4218] (c) By looking at the equation of the least-squares line, you \r\n[L4219] can see that the correlation between weight and tail length \r\n[L4220] is positive.\r\n[L4221] (d) If you had measured the tail length in centimeters \r\n[L4222] instead of millimeters, the slope of the regression line \r\n[L4223] would have been 3/10 = 0.3.\r\n[L4224] (e) One mouse weighed 29 grams and had a tail length of \r\n[L4225] 100 millimeters.

The figure below shows a Normal density curve. \r\n[L4227] Which of the following gives the best estimates for the \r\n[L4228] mean and standard deviation of this Normal distribution?\r\n[L4229] 0.000\r\n[L4230] 0.002\r\n[L4231] 0.004\r\n[L4232] 0.006\r\n[L4233] 0.008\r\n[L4234] 0.010\r\n[L4235] 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\r\n[L4236] (a) \u03bc = 200, \u03c3 = 50 (d) \u03bc = 225, \u03c3 = 25\r\n[L4237] (b) \u03bc = 200, \u03c3 = 25 (e) \u03bc = 225, \u03c3 = 275 \r\n[L4238] (c) \u03bc = 225, \u03c3 = 50\r\n[L4239] AP1.7. The owner of a chain of supermarkets notices that \r\n[L4240] there is a positive correlation between the sales of beer \r\n[L4241] and the sales of ice cream over the course of the previous \r\n[L4242] year. During seasons when sales of beer were above aver\ufffeage, sales of ice cream also tended to be above average. \r\n[L4243] Likewise, during seasons when sales of beer were below \r\n[L4244] average, sales of ice cream also tended to be below average. \r\n[L4245] Which of the following would be a valid conclusion from \r\n[L4246] these facts?\r\n[L4247] (a) Sales records must be in error. There should be no \r\n[L4248] association between beer and ice cream sales.\r\n[L4249] (b) Evidently, for a significant proportion of customers of \r\n[L4250] these supermarkets, drinking beer causes a desire for ice \r\n[L4251] cream or eating ice cream causes a thirst for beer.\r\n[L4252] (c) A scatterplot of monthly ice cream sales versus \r\n[L4253] monthly beer sales would show that a straight line describes\r\n[L4254] the pattern in the plot, but it would have to be a horizontal \r\n[L4255] line.\r\n[L4256] (d) There is a clear negative association between beer sales \r\n[L4257] and ice cream sales.\r\n[L4258] (e) The positive correlation is most likely a result of the \r\n[L4259] lurking variable temperature; that is, as temperatures \r\n[L4260] increase, so do both beer sales and ice cream sales.\r\n[L4261] AP1.8. Here are the IQ scores of 10 randomly chosen \r\n[L4262] fifth-grade students:\r\n[L4263] 145 139 126 122 125 130 96 110 118 118\r\n[L4264] Which of the following statements about this data set is \r\n[L4265] not true?\r\n[L4266] (a) The student with an IQ of 96 is considered an outlier \r\n[L4267] by the 1.5 \u00d7 IQR rule.\r\n[L4268] (b) The five-number summary of the 10 IQ scores is 96, \r\n[L4269] 118, 123.5, 130, 145.\r\n[L4270] (c) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4271] mean of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be higher than \r\n[L4272] the mean of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4273] (d) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4274] standard deviation of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be \r\n[L4275] lower than the standard deviation of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4276] (e) If the value 96 were removed from the data set, the \r\n[L4277] IQR of the remaining 9 IQ scores would be lower than the \r\n[L4278] IQR of all 10 IQ scores.\r\n[L4279] AP1.9. Before he goes to bed each night, Mr. Kleen pours \r\n[L4280] dishwasher powder into his dishwasher and turns it on. \r\n[L4281] Each morning, Mrs. Kleen weighs the box of dishwasher \r\n[L4282] powder. From an examination of the data, she concludes \r\n[L4283] that Mr. Kleen dispenses a rather consistent amount \r\n[L4284] of powder each night. Which of the following statements \r\n[L4285] is true?\r\n[L4286] I. There is a high positive correlation between the \r\n[L4287] number of days that have passed since the box of dish\ufffewasher powder was opened and the amount of powder \r\n[L4288] left in the box.\r\n[L4289] II. A scatterplot with days since purchase as the explana\ufffetory variable and amount of dishwasher powder used as \r\n[L4290] the response variable would display a strong positive \r\n[L4291] association.\r\n[L4292] III.

The GSS begins by selecting a sample of counties \r\n[L4303] from the 3000 counties in the country. The counties are \r\n[L4304] divided into urban, rural, and suburban; a separate sample \r\n[L4305] is chosen at random from each group.

You are planning an experiment to determine \r\n[L4317] the effect of the brand of gasoline and the weight of a car \r\n[L4318] on gas mileage measured in miles per gallon. You will use \r\n[L4319] a single test car, adding weights so that its total weight is \r\n[L4320] 3000, 3500, or 4000 pounds. The car will drive on a test \r\n[L4321] track at each weight using each of Amoco, Marathon, and \r\n[L4322] Speedway gasoline. Which is the best way to organize the \r\n[L4323] study?\r\n[L4324] (a) Start with 3000 pounds and Amoco and run the car on \r\n[L4325] the test track. Then do 3500 and 4000 pounds. Change to \r\n[L4326] Marathon and go through the three weights in order. Then \r\n[L4327] change to Speedway and do the three weights in order\r\n[L4328] once more.\r\n[L4329] (b) Start with 3000 pounds and Amoco and run the car \r\n[L4330] on the test track. Then change to Marathon and then to \r\n[L4331] Speedway without changing the weight. Then add weights \r\n[L4332] to get 3500 pounds and go through the three gasolines in \r\n[L4333] the same order. Then change to 4000 pounds and do the \r\n[L4334] three gasolines in order again.\r\n[L4335] (c) Choose a gasoline at random, and run the car with this \r\n[L4336] gasoline at 3000, 3500, and 4000 pounds in order.

Those who advocate for monetary incentives in \r\n[L4403] a work environment claim that this type of incentive has \r\n[L4404] the greatest appeal because it allows the winners to do what \r\n[L4405] they want with their winnings.

Not only are there national brands for \r\n[L4428] most products, but many stores have their own in-house \r\n[L4429] brands. Since shelf space is not infinite, the question is \r\n[L4430] how many linear feet to allocate to each product and \r\n[L4431] which shelf (top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle) \r\n[L4432] to put it on. The middle shelf is the most popular and lu\ufffecrative, since many shoppers, if undecided, will simply \r\n[L4433] pick the product that is at eye level. \r\n[L4434] A local store that sells many upscale goods is trying to \r\n[L4435] determine how much shelf space to allocate to its own \r\n[L4436] brand of men\u2019s personal-grooming products.

Notes: Using Studies Wisely (Section 4.3)}\n\\author{}\n\\date{}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\maketitle\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\\section{Why ``using studies wisely'' matters}\nMany statistical studies aim to make conclusions that go \\emph{beyond} the individuals actually studied.\nThis section is about \\emph{what you are entitled to conclude} given the design:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Can we generalize to a population?\n\\item Can we claim cause-and-effect?\n\\item Are there limits from realism and ethics?\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Scope of inference}\n\n\\begin{definition}[Inference (informal)]\n\\emph{Inference} means drawing conclusions that go beyond the observed sample/subjects.\nThe \\emph{scope of inference} is the set of claims that are justified by the study design.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\subsection{Two key design features}\nThere are two different ``superpowers'' we might want:\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\arabic*.]\n\\item \\textbf{Inference about a population:} justified by \\emph{random selection} (random sampling).\n\\item \\textbf{Inference about cause-and-effect:} justified by \\emph{random assignment} (in an experiment).\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Do not mix these up]\nRandom \\emph{sampling} supports generalization to a population.\nRandom \\emph{assignment} supports a causal claim \\emph{in the study setting}.\nA study can have one, both, or neither.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection{The scope-of-inference table}\nLet:\n\\[\n\\text{RS}=\\text{random selection from a population},\\qquad\n\\text{RA}=\\text{random assignment to treatments/groups}.\n\\]\nThen:\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}\n\\toprule\n & \\textbf{RA: Yes} & \\textbf{RA: No} \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textbf{RS: Yes} &\nPopulation inference: YES \\quad Causation: YES &\nPopulation inference: YES \\quad Causation: NO \\\\\n\\textbf{RS: No} &\nPopulation inference: NO \\quad Causation: YES &\nPopulation inference: NO \\quad Causation: NO \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Typical real-world pattern]\nMany experiments use volunteers (RA yes, RS no). They can support causation,\nbut generalizing to a broader population requires extra justification.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection{A basic effect-size computation (often used in this chapter)}\nWhen the response is binary (e.g.\\ ``has canker sores: yes/no''), we often compare\n\\emph{proportions} across groups:\n\\[\n\\hat p_1=\\frac{x_1}{n_1},\\qquad \\hat p_2=\\frac{x_2}{n_2},\\qquad\n\\widehat{\\Delta}_p=\\hat p_1-\\hat p_2.\n\\]\nHere $\\widehat{\\Delta}_p$ estimates the treatment effect in a two-group setting.\nWhether this \\emph{difference} supports causation or generalization depends on RS/RA.\n\n\\section{Worked example: four designs for the same question}\n\n\\begin{example}[Vitamin C and canker sores: four designs]\nA dentist wants to know whether taking 500 mg of vitamin C daily reduces canker sores\namong dental patients in a town. Consider four designs:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\textbf{Design \\arabic*:}, leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Convenience + observational (no RS, no RA).}\nRecruit patients with appointments in the next two weeks. Ask who already takes vitamin C.\nCompare the proportion with sores among users vs nonusers.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Convenience + experiment (no RS, yes RA).}\nRecruit patients with appointments in the next two weeks, then randomly assign half to vitamin C\nand half to no vitamin C (or placebo). Compare proportions.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Random sample + observational (yes RS, no RA).}\nTake a random sample of dental patients in town. Ask who already takes vitamin C.\nCompare proportions among users vs nonusers.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Random sample + experiment (yes RS, yes RA).}\nTake a random sample of dental patients in town, then randomly assign half to vitamin C\nand half to no vitamin C (or placebo). Compare proportions.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nTo make this concrete, suppose in a particular comparison we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Vitamin C group: } n_1=40,\\ x_1=8 \\text{ have sores } \\Rightarrow \\hat p_1=\\frac{8}{40}=0.20,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{No vitamin C group: } n_2=40,\\ x_2=18 \\text{ have sores } \\Rightarrow \\hat p_2=\\frac{18}{40}=0.45,\n\\]\nso\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\Delta}_p=\\hat p_1-\\hat p_2=0.20-0.45=-0.25.\n\\]\nA negative difference suggests fewer sores in the vitamin C group.\n\n\\medskip\n\\noindent\\textbf{What may we conclude?}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Design 1:} no population inference (no RS) and no causation (no RA).\nYou can only describe an association in those recruited patients.\n\\item \\textbf{Design 2:} no population inference (no RS), but causation is supported (RA),\n\\emph{for the recruited subjects in this setting} (assuming good control and compliance).\n\\item \\textbf{Design 3:} population inference is supported (RS), but causation is not (no RA).\nYou can generalize the observed association to the town's dental-patient population,\nbut confounding is possible.\n\\item \\textbf{Design 4:} both population inference and causation are supported (RS + RA),\n\\emph{for the population that was actually sampled} (here: the town's dental patients).\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{example}\n\n\\begin{remark}[A common pitfall: wrong population]\nEven in Design 4, if the sample was drawn from \\emph{dental patients}, you cannot automatically\nextend the conclusion to \\emph{all town residents}. The population is determined by the sampling frame.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\section{The challenges of establishing causation}\n\n\\subsection{Internal validity vs realism}\nA well-designed experiment (with RA and proper control) supports causation \\emph{in the study setting}.\nHowever, applying the result elsewhere can fail due to \\emph{lack of realism}:\nthe subjects, environment, or implementation may differ from the situation you care about.\n\n\\begin{example}[Brake lights: context changes can shrink effects]\nSuppose early fleet experiments suggested an intervention reduced rear-end collisions by 50\\%.\nIf a fleet had 100 rear-end collisions/year, a 50\\% drop predicts about 50/year.\nBut if the intervention later becomes universal and the observed reduction is only 5\\%,\nthe prediction becomes 95/year instead.\nSame causal mechanism idea, very different context---hence very different effect size.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\subsection{When experiments are impossible}\nSome important causal questions cannot be tested by random assignment\nbecause it is impractical or unethical (e.g.\\ forcing harmful exposures).\nIn such cases, observational studies may be the best available evidence.\n\n\\subsection{Arguing causation from observational evidence (a checklist)}\nWhen experiments cannot be done, strong causal arguments typically rely on multiple lines of evidence.\n\n\\begin{definition}[Nonexperimental evidence checklist for causation]\nA causal claim from observational evidence is strengthened when:\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\arabic*.]\n\\item \\textbf{Association is strong} (large effect size).\n\\item \\textbf{Association is consistent} across studies and populations.\n\\item \\textbf{Dose--response} appears (more exposure $\\Rightarrow$ stronger response; reduced exposure $\\Rightarrow$ reduced risk).\n\\item \\textbf{Correct time order} holds (cause precedes effect, often with a plausible lag).\n\\item \\textbf{Plausible mechanism} exists (biological/physical explanation, often supported by lab/animal studies).\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{example}[``Strong association'' with risk ratios (toy numbers)]\nIn a cohort study:\n\\[\n\\text{Smokers: } n=10{,}000,\\ \\text{lung cancer }=200 \\Rightarrow \\hat p_S=0.020,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Nonsmokers: } n=10{,}000,\\ \\text{lung cancer }=10 \\Rightarrow \\hat p_N=0.001.\n\\]\nRisk ratio (RR) estimate:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{RR}}=\\frac{\\hat p_S}{\\hat p_N}=\\frac{0.020}{0.001}=20.\n\\]\nA ratio near 20 is a strong association. By itself it does not prove causation, but it is one component\nof a broader causal argument using the checklist above.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{Data ethics (human subjects)}\n\n\\subsection{Basic standards}\nStudies involving humans must follow core ethical requirements.\n\n\\begin{definition}[Basic data ethics requirements]\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\arabic*.]\n\\item \\textbf{Institutional Review Board (IRB) review:} the study plan must be reviewed in advance.\n\\item \\textbf{Informed consent:} participants must agree, after being informed about what will happen and risks.\n\\item \\textbf{Confidentiality:} individual data must be protected; only group summaries should be made public.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Purpose of an IRB]\nAn IRB is primarily about protecting participants' rights and welfare.\nIt can require design changes, reviews consent procedures, and monitors ongoing work.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection{Confidentiality vs anonymity}\n\\begin{definition}[Confidentiality vs anonymity]\n\\textbf{Confidentiality} means the researchers may know identities, but must protect them\n(e.g.\\ separate identifiers from data, restrict access, report only aggregates).\n\n\\textbf{Anonymity} means identities are not known even to the study organizers.\nTrue anonymity is uncommon and can prevent follow-up with participants.\n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Modern risk: re-identification]\nEven if direct identifiers are removed, combining multiple data sources can sometimes re-identify individuals.\nThis is why privacy practice must consider the broader data environment.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{example}[Simple confidentiality plan]\nA survey assigns each participant an ID number. Names and contact details are stored in a separate file\nfrom responses. Analyses and reports use only the ID and publish only group summaries (means/proportions).\n\\end{example}\n\n\\section*{Exercises (curated from Section 4.3)}\n\\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Exercises (curated from Section 4.3)}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\textbf{4.3.\\arabic*}, leftmargin=*]\n\n\\item \\textbf{Random sampling vs random assignment.}\nExplain the difference between what random sampling allows you to infer and what random assignment allows you to infer.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Classify designs using the scope-of-inference table.}\nFor each design below, state whether population inference is justified and whether a causal claim is justified.\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\alph*)]\n\\item Volunteers are randomly assigned to Treatment A or B.\n\\item A random sample is taken from a population and subjects are only observed (no imposed treatment).\n\\item A convenience sample is taken and subjects choose whether to take a supplement; outcomes are compared.\n\\item A random sample is taken and then subjects are randomly assigned to treatment or placebo.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Foster care vs orphanages (design and conclusion).}\nA study on 136 abandoned children in one city randomly assigns half to foster care and half to remain in orphanages.\nWhat conclusion(s) are justified?

Causation: NO (self-selection + no random assignment).\\\\\n(d) Population inference: YES. Causation: YES.\n\n\\item Causation: YES for these 136 children in this setting (random assignment).\nGeneralization: limited; they are not a random sample of all abandoned children (even less of all children).\n\n\\item Both: YES for the warehouse population of AA batteries at the time of sampling (RS + RA), assuming the sample was genuinely random and the experiment properly controlled. Generalization beyond that warehouse/time requires extra justification.\n\n\\item You can say: in this volunteer sample, there is no convincing statistical evidence of a sex difference in mean word count (given the analysis used).\nYou cannot say: men and women speak equally in the broader population, nor that there is \\emph{no} difference (absence of evidence $\\neq$ evidence of absence).\n\n\\item Observational with RS: you may generalize an association to the sampled adult population, but you cannot claim church attendance \\emph{causes} longer life; residual confounding and measurement issues may remain.\n\n\\item Example concerns: simulator behavior may not match real driving; subjects may not represent real drivers; outcomes/risks differ; adherence and long-term adaptation differ; novelty effects; controlled conditions omit weather/traffic complexity.\n\n\\item Generalizing is doubtful: lab task, time scale, stakes, incentives, and social dynamics differ greatly; ``failure'' is artificial; subjects are students; external validity (realism) is weak.\n\n\\item Checklist: strong association; consistent across studies/populations; dose--response; cause precedes effect; plausible mechanism.\nConsistency reduces the chance that one specific lurking variable explains all findings; dose--response makes it harder for a single fixed confounder to mimic the pattern (and reversal after stopping exposure strengthens the causal story).\n\n\\item Confidentiality: identities may be known to researchers but are protected; reports only aggregated results.\nAnonymity: identities are unknown even to researchers; hard to achieve and prevents follow-up.\nExample confidentiality: ID codes + separate name file; example anonymity: truly untracked mail-in survey with no identifiers (rare).\n\n\\item\n(a) Often acceptable under animal-research ethics oversight; issue: animal welfare/necessity.\\\\\n(b) Deception/impact on employers; may be acceptable with IRB approval and minimal risk, but ethically sensitive.\\\\\n(c) Generally acceptable design; key issues: informed consent, risk/benefit, monitoring, placebo ethics.\\\\\n(d) Consent/privacy of filmed individuals; potential harm; likely problematic unless strict safeguards/justification and legal/IRB compliance.\n\n\\item Lowest to highest risk: (i) finger prick, (ii) arm blood draw, (iii) indwelling tube.\nJustification: invasiveness, infection risk, discomfort, and duration increase across the three.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nSource basis (Section 4.3 content, examples, and exercise prompts): \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file1\ue202L3244-L3333\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file1\ue202L3334-L3388\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file1\ue202L3389-L3491\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file1\ue202L3528-L3703\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":17502,"end_ix":17536,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"designing_studies_in_statistics.pdf","id":"file_00000000f06071fab9d78f36b4718e70","source":"my_files","text":"262 CHAPTER 4 DESIGNING STUDIES\nLet\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned about the scope of inference in a statistical study.

ethics with minors\n\n### Synthetic data generation plan (population-first)\n**Create a finite population** of students across multiple schools; then \u201crun\u201d multiple study designs as samples drawn from that population.\n\n**Population structure**\n- Schools: \\(S=8\\)\n- Classes per school: \\(C=6\\)\n- Students per class: \\(m=25\\)\n- Total \\(N = 8\\cdot 6\\cdot 25 = 1200\\) (small enough to compute exactly; can scale up later)\n\n**Latent and observed variables**\n- Socioeconomic status (SES): categorical \\(\\{0,1,2\\}\\) with school-specific mix  \n- Baseline ability \\(A \\sim \\mathcal N(0,1)\\)\n- \u201cConscientiousness\u201d latent \\(H \\sim \\mathcal N(0,1)\\) (drives both outcomes and survey participation)\n- Screen time (hours/day):  \n  \\[\n  \\text{screen} = \\max\\{0,\\ 3.5 + 0.8\\cdot \\mathbf{1}(\\text{SES}=2) - 0.5H + \\epsilon_s\\},\\quad \\epsilon_s\\sim\\mathcal N(0,1)\n  \\]\n- True sleep (hours/night):  \n  \\[\n  \\text{sleep}_{\\text{true}} = \\mathrm{clip}\\big(8.0 - 0.35\\cdot \\text{screen} + 0.25H + \\epsilon_\\ell,\\ 4,\\ 10\\big)\n  \\]\n- Exam score (0\u2013100):  \n  \\[\n  \\text{score} = \\mathrm{clip}\\big(65 + 10A + 2.0(\\text{sleep}_{\\text{true}}-7) + 1.5\\cdot \\text{SES} + \\epsilon_y,\\ 0,\\ 100\\big)\n  \\]\n- Self-reported sleep (survey measurement error + desirability bias):  \n  \\[\n  \\text{sleep}_{\\text{self}} = \\text{sleep}_{\\text{true}} + \\eta,\\quad \\eta\\sim\\mathcal N(\\mu_\\eta, \\sigma_\\eta^2)\n  \\]\n  where set \\(\\mu_\\eta>0\\) for high-SES (over-reporting) to model response bias.\n\n**Survey participation mechanisms (to create nonresponse bias)**\n- Response probability:\n  \\[\n  \\Pr(\\text{respond}=1) = \\mathrm{logistic}(-0.5 + 0.6H - 0.4\\cdot \\mathbf{1}(\\text{sleep}_{\\text{true}}<6))\n  \\]\nSo lower-sleep students respond less \u2192 nonresponse bias.\n\n### Study designs \u201crun\u201d on the population\n**Part A (4.1): compare sampling methods**\n1) **Convenience sample**: first 200 students arriving before 7:15am  \n   - Model: those arriving early have lower sleep by construction (they must wake earlier)\n2) **Voluntary response online poll**: anyone can click; heavy selection on strong opinions (model: respond probability increases with extreme screen time or extreme fatigue)\n3) **Stratified random sample**: sample within each school proportional to size; compare estimates to the known population mean\n\n**Key calculations**\n- Estimate population mean sleep via \\(\\bar x\\); show bias: \\(\\bar x_{\\text{conv}} - \\mu_{\\text{pop}}\\)\n- Show \u201cbig \\(n\\)\u201d fallacy: voluntary response can have huge \\(n\\) but still biased\n- Quantify nonresponse rate and resulting distortion (compare respondents vs nonrespondents)\n\n**Part B (4.2): experiment**\n- Intervention: \u201cdigital curfew app\u201d deployed at class level  \n- **Random assignment**: randomly assign classes within each school to Treatment vs Control (**blocked by school**)  \n- Compliance: only a fraction comply;

You will:\n1) Replicate the claim with an **observational study** (and show it can be misleading)\n2) Run a **randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial**\n3) Interpret what can be concluded and what cannot (especially about population generalization)\n\n### What it illustrates\n- **4.1:** sampling frame (clinic patients vs general population), self-selection, nonresponse/dropout, response bias on lifestyle variables\n- **4.2:** placebo effect, blinding, random assignment, matched pairs crossover option, replication, blocking by baseline SBP\n- **4.3:** causal inference vs generalization; arguing causation without experiments; ethics (IRB, informed consent, confidentiality)\n\n### Synthetic data generation plan (build confounding + Simpson\u2019s paradox)\n**Population**\n- \\(N=20{,}000\\) adults in a city\n- Covariates:\n  - age 30\u201375\n  - latent health-consciousness \\(H\\)\n  - exercise minutes/week\n  - baseline SBP\n\n**Core structural model**\n- \\(H \\sim \\mathcal N(0,1)\\)  \n- Exercise:\n  \\[\n  \\text{ex} = \\mathrm{clip}(120 + 60H + \\epsilon,\\ 0,\\ 600)\n  \\]\n- Baseline SBP:\n  \\[\n  \\text{SBP}_0 = 125 + 0.6(\\text{age}-50) - 4H + \\epsilon_0\n  \\]\n- **Supplement uptake (self-selection)**:\n  \\[\n  \\Pr(\\text{supp}=1)=\\mathrm{logistic}(-1 + 1.2H + 0.02(\\text{age}-50))\n  \\]\nSo supplement users are more health-conscious and differ in baseline risk.\n\n**True causal effect**\n- True supplement effect: \\(-2\\) mmHg (small)\n- Placebo effect: \\(-1\\) mmHg if people believe they\u2019re treated\n- Measurement noise: \\(\\pm 3\\) mmHg\n\n**Observed follow-up SBP (observational world)**\n- If observational (no random assignment), follow-up SBP depends on exercise change too:\n  \\[\n  \\text{SBP}_1 = \\text{SBP}_0 - 0.01(\\text{ex}-120) + \\tau\\cdot \\mathbf{1}(\\text{supp}=1) + \\epsilon_1\n  \\]\nwith \\(\\tau=-2\\). Because \\(\\text{supp}\\) is correlated with \\(H\\) and exercise, naive comparisons overstate the supplement effect.\n\n**Simpson\u2019s paradox knob**\n- Introduce a risk stratum \\(R\\in\\{\\text{high},\\text{low}\\}\\) determined by age and baseline SBP.\n- Make supplement adoption very high in low-risk and low in high-risk (or vice versa) so aggregated results reverse stratified results.\n\n### Study designs\n**Part A (observational \u201cstudy\u201d)**\n- Clinic recruits \u201canyone who already takes supplement\u201d + \u201canyone who doesn\u2019t\u201d\n- Compare \\(\\bar{\\text{SBP}}_1\\) between groups \u2192 often shows huge effect due to confounding\n- Show stratifying by risk group reverses or shrinks the effect (Simpson\u2019s paradox demonstration)\n\n**Part B (randomized trial)**\n- Recruit volunteers (or random sample from clinic patient list\u2014two variants)\n- **Random assignment** to supplement vs placebo\n- **Double-blind**: neither subjects nor assessors know assignment\n- Dropout probability depends on side effects and on baseline SBP (introduces missingness)\n\n**Optional extension (matched pairs / crossover)**\n- For short-lived biomarkers: each subject gets placebo and supplement on different weeks in random order; analyze within-subject differences\n\n### Key calculations\n- Difference in means: \\(\\widehat{\\Delta} = \\bar y_{\\text{supp}} - \\bar y_{\\text{control}}\\)\n- Difference in proportions if using binary outcomes (e.g., \u201cSBP controlled < 130\u201d)\n- For matched pairs: \\(d_i = y_i(\\text{supp}) - y_i(\\text{placebo})\\), analyze \\(\\bar d\\)\n- Interpret \u201cstatistically significant\u201d vs \u201cclinically meaningful\u201d (e.g., 2 mmHg might matter at population scale, but for individuals it\u2019s modest)\n\n### 4.3 interpretation hooks\n- Volunteers + random assignment \u21d2 causation supported, generalization limited\n- Random sampling + random assignment \u21d2 stronger population + causation\n- Observational: use causation checklist (strength, consistency, dose-response, time order, mechanism) and show where it fails or is ambiguous\n- Ethics: IRB review, informed consent, confidentiality; also discuss placebo ethics (acceptable when no proven standard treatment is withheld)\n\n---\n\n## Case Study 3 \u2014 Public policy / environment: road-safety intervention with external-validity trap\n\n### Theme / real-world story\nA city considers installing a new school-zone warning system (signage + flashing beacons).

We\u2019ll focus on sampling strategies, biases, and conducting a randomized experiment to evaluate the implementation.\n\n\\section{Part 0: Population and Variables Definitions}\nThe population consists of two schools (North and South) and students from two grades (10 and 11). The outcome variable of interest is \\textit{hours of sleep last night}.\nWe provide the following population summary:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{| l | c | c | c |}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{School} & \\textbf{Grade} & \\textbf{N (total number of students)} & \\textbf{True Mean Sleep (hours)} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{School A} & \\text{Grade 10} & 180 & 6.9 \\\\\n\\text{School A} & \\text{Grade 11} & 150 & 6.4 \\\\\n\\text{School B} & \\text{Grade 10} & 220 & 7.3 \\\\\n\\text{School B} & \\text{Grade 11} & 200 & 6.8 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nUse this information to compute the overall population mean for sleep.\n\n\\textbf{Expected Answer:}\n\nThe overall true population mean is computed using the population size-weighted average. Here's the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Population Mean} = \\frac{\\sum (N_h \\times \\mu_h)}{\\text{Total N}}\n\\]\n\n\\section{Part 1: Surveys}\n\n\\subsection{1A: Convenience Sample}\nYou are tasked with estimating the mean sleep hours for a convenience sample of early-arrival students. The following data was collected:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{Student ID} & \\text{Self-reported Sleep}  \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 5.5 \\\\\n2 & 6.1 \\\\\n3 & 6.5 \\\\\n4 & 6.8 \\\\\n5 & 7.0 \\\\\n6 & 6.4 \\\\\n7 & 5.1 \\\\\n8 & 5.7 \\\\\n9 & 6.2 \\\\\n10 & 6.6 \\\\\n11 & 6.8 \\\\\n12 & 5.9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the sample mean of self-reported sleep and compare this with population trends.\nFor convenience, the true population mean = 6.9 hours (school A, grade 10).\n\n\\subsection{1B: Voluntary Response Sample}\nFor an online survey, you are provided with the following data:\n\n\\text{Total participants} = 1200, \\text{} with a self-reported mean of 7.5.\n\nDiscuss the potential bias introduced via this sampling method. Highlight the lack of representativeness in voluntary response.\n\n\\subsection{1C: Stratified Sample}\nHere's a stratified random sample data based on grade and school:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{| c | c | c |}\n\\hline\n\\text{Stratum} & \\text{Sample Size (n)} & \\text{Sum of Sleep Hours} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{School A Grade 10} & 20 & 135 \\\\\n\\text{School A Grade 11} & 17 & 108 \\\\\n\\text{School B Grade 10} & 25 & 190 \\\\\n\\text{School B Grade 11} & 23 & 156 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nUse this data to calculate the stratum-level sample mean and the overall stratified estimator for population mean sleep hours.\n\n\\subsection{1D: Nonresponse}\nA mail survey was sent to a total of 200 students, with the number of responses per grade as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{| c | c |}\n\\hline\n\\text{Stratum} & \\text{Number of Responses} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{School A Grade 10} & 50 \\\\\n\\text{School A Grade 11} & 40 \\\\\n\\text{School B Grade 10} & 60 \\\\\n\\text{School B Grade 11} & 50 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nCompute the response rates for each grade and discuss the potential biases from nonresponse.\n\n\\subsection{1E: Wording Effect}\nTwo versions of the survey question about sleep were asked, leading to these results:\n\nQuestion 1: \\textit{\\\"How many hours did you sleep last night?\"} $ \\rightarrow \\text{mean} = 6.8 \\text{ hours}$\n\nQuestion 2: \\textit{\\\"On average, how much sleep do you feel like you got last night?\"} $ \\rightarrow \\text{mean} = 7.2 \\text{ hours}$\n\nEvaluate the effect of question wording on the results.\n\n\\section{Part 2: Experiment Design}\n\nThe intervention on sleep was tested through a randomized controlled trial at 4 classes. Here's the data:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{| c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c |}\n\\hline\n\\text{Class} & \\text{Group} & \\text{Class Size} & \\text{Baseline Sleep} & \\text{Follow-up Sleep} & \\text{Baseline Score} & \\text{Follow-up Score} & \\text{Compliance} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{A1} & \\text{T} & 26 & 6.5 & 7.0 & 68 & 72 & 0.65 \\\\\n\\text{A2} & \\text{T} & 24 & 6.6 & 7.1 & 67 & 71 & 0.60 \\\\\n\\text{A3} & \\text{C} & 25 & 6.4 & 6.6 & 66 & 68 & \\text{N/A} \\\\\n\\text{A4} & \\text{C} & 25 & 6.5 & 6.7 & 67 & 69 & \\text{N/A} \\\\\n\\text{B1} & \\text{T} & 25 & 7.0 & 7.3 & 70 & 73 & 0.55 \\\\\n\\text{B2} & \\text{T} & 27 & 6.9 & 7.2 & 71 & 74 & 0.50 \\\\\n\\text{B3} & \\text{C} & 24 & 6.8 & 6.9 & 69 & 70 & \\text{N/A} \\\\\n\\text{B4} & \\text{C} & 25 & 6.9 & 7.0 & 70 & 71 & \\text{N/A} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nCompute the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect on sleep and exam score across the groups.\n\n\\section{Part 3: Using Studies Wisely}\n\n\\subsection{Scope of Inference}\nConsider the designs used in the previous sections, comment on the scope of inference and generalizability.\n\n\\subsection{Realism and Ethics}\nDiscuss the potential barriers and ethical concerns that might emerge based on the experiment setup.\n\n\\section{Answer Key (Concise)}\n\\subsection{Part 0}\nPopulation Mean = X hours (formula for weighted mean)\n\n\\subsection{Part 1}\n1A (Convenience Sample) Mean = Y hours  \n1B (Voluntary Response Bias) - Explanation  \n1C (Stratified Mean) - Z hours  \n1D (Nonresponse Computation) - Response rates  \n1E (Wording Bias Comparison) - Findings\n\n\\subsection{Part 2}\nITT Effect on Sleep: 0.4 hours  \nITT Effect on Score: 2 points  \n```\n\n","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"1d56267b-cc0f-4e9f-af9d-5e41d3f45134","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"1b60a57a-d56d-409f-bfc1-3ff0650dc031","turn_exchange_id":"559a1ab9-7b43-4d63-aac9-36c15087bb17"},"recipient":"python","channel":null},"parent":"1b60a57a-d56d-409f-bfc1-3ff0650dc031","children":["8a3243da-4104-44dc-b235-3b6f2d4a3d53"]},"8a3243da-4104-44dc-b235-3b6f2d4a3d53":{"id":"8a3243da-4104-44dc-b235-3b6f2d4a3d53","message":{"id":"8a3243da-4104-44dc-b235-3b6f2d4a3d53","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768732329.290583,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Calculating treatment effect using difference-in-differences","content":"Alright, I have the difference in follow-up sleep: treated group at 7.15 hours, control at 6.799, so that's a difference of 0.351 hours.

Subjects: students. Treatment: app-enabled curfew. Control: no curfew. Responses: Sleep$_1$, Score$_1$ (and changes).\n\n\\textbf{7.2} Weighted means:\n$\\bar y_{T,1}^{\\text{sleep}}=7.150$,\n$\\bar y_{C,1}^{\\text{sleep}}=6.799$,\nso ITT on Sleep$_1$ is $0.351$ hours.\nFor Score$_1$: $\\bar y_{T,1}=72.539$, $\\bar y_{C,1}=69.495$, so ITT is $3.044$ points.\n\n\\textbf{7.3} Changes: ITT on $\\Delta$Sleep is $0.248$ hours; ITT on $\\Delta$Score is $1.985$ points.\n\n\\textbf{7.4} Within-school $\\Delta$Score effects:\nSchool A: $2.0$; School B: $2.0$; average $2.0$.\nOverall ITT on $\\Delta$Score is $1.985$; close, differences from weighting/rounding.\n\n\\textbf{7.5 (optional)} Treated compliance (weighted):\n$p_T\\approx 0.574$. With $p_C=0.06$,\nCACE on $\\Delta$Sleep $\\approx 0.248/(0.574-0.06)=0.482$ hours,\nCACE on $\\Delta$Score $\\approx 1.985/(0.574-0.06)=3.862$ points.\nInterpretation: among compliers, the curfew effect is larger than the ITT (which is diluted by noncompliance).\n\n\\medskip\n\\textbf{8.1} Population vs causation:\n(a) no population, no causation.\n(b) no population, no causation.\n(c) population yes, causation no.\n(d) population limited (volunteer classes), causation yes.\n(e) population yes (district), causation yes.\n\n\\textbf{8.2} Justified conclusion: ``In these participating classes over 6 weeks, assignment to digital curfew increased sleep and improved scores on average (ITT).'' Not justified: ``This will raise scores for all students nationwide by the same amount'' (no random sampling + realism concerns).\n\n\\medskip\n\\textbf{9.1} External validity concerns: novelty wears off; enforcement/compliance changes; curriculum/assessment changes; seasonal sleep patterns; long-run adaptation.\n\n\\textbf{9.2} IRB: Institutional Review Board approval to protect participant welfare.
