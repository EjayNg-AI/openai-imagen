This discovery surpasses the previous record held by a galaxy seen at 325 million years post-Big Bang. The newfound galaxy appears much brighter than expected, challenging conventional cosmological theories about the early universe. Dr. Francesco D'Eugenio and Dr. Stefano Carniani, part of the discovery team, suggest that early galaxies and black holes may have grown more rapidly than anticipated. The $10 billion telescope, launched in 2021, can detect these distant galaxies due to its ability to observe extreme redshift phenomena. The unexpected brightness of JADES-GS-z14-0 implies that the telescope could identify even fainter galaxies, offering deeper insights into the universe's infancy within the first 200 million years. Prof. Brant Robertson believes this could reveal the earliest stages of galaxy formation and evolution.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52},"pub_date":1717157507.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.livescience.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/previously-unimaginable-james-webb-telescope-breaks-its-own-record-again-discovering-farthest-known-galaxy-in-the-universe","title":"'Previously unimaginable': James Webb telescope breaks its own record again, discovering farthest known galaxy in the universe","snippet":"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered the most distant galaxy ever observed, named MoM-z14, whose light dates back to just 280 million years after the Big Bang. This discovery breaks the previous distance record set by the galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0. With a redshift of 14.44, MoM-z14 confirms the surprising abundance of bright, ancient galaxies, challenging existing theories about early galaxy formation. The galaxy is compact at 240 light-years wide and has mass comparable to the Small Magellanic Cloud. It was observed undergoing a burst of star formation and shows a nitrogen-to-carbon ratio similar to that found in ancient globular clusters. This suggests early stars may have formed similarly to those in the Milky Way\u2019s globular clusters.

This galaxy, observed as it appeared only 330 million years after the Big Bang, suggests the universe's first stars affected their environment earlier than previously believed. The findings, published in the journal *Nature*, hint that the reionization era, when UV light re-emerged by knocking electrons off hydrogen atoms, started earlier than anticipated. Despite expectations that the early universe's fog would block such light, JADES-GS-z13-1's UV light has reached Earth due to ionizing its surrounding hydrogen gas. The Lyman-alpha emission might originate from early massive stars or a supermassive black hole, challenging current understanding of early galaxy formation.

This system, composed of five physically connected emission-line galaxies and 17 galaxy clumps, showcases intense star formation and strong hydrogen and oxygen emissions. The discovery is significant due to the rarity of such large-scale early-universe mergers. Most galaxy mergers involve only two galaxies, with multi-galaxy interactions being extremely uncommon.\n\nJWST's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) detected a shared gas halo, confirming the galaxies are interacting and not merely aligned by chance. The galaxies' close proximity (from 43,300 to 60,700 light-years apart) suggests future merging. JWST's Quintet resembles the well-known Stephan's Quintet, though the newly found system is much younger and more active in star formation.\n\nWith a stellar mass equivalent to 10 billion suns, the merger may lead to a massive, quiescent galaxy within 1\u20131.5 billion years after the Big Bang. The findings provide rare insight into early galaxy evolution and challenge existing models, potentially hinting at new mechanisms in the universe\u2019s formative years.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1756933009.0,"attribution":"www.livescience.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/science/earliest-known-galaxy-spotted-by-webb-telescope-is-beacon-cosmic-dawn-2024-05-31/","title":"Earliest-known galaxy, spotted by Webb telescope, is a beacon to cosmic dawn","snippet":"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has identified the earliest-known galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0, formed just 290 million years after the Big Bang, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe's infancy.

This discovery was made by the JADES research team, revealing that early galaxies were far more luminous than previously thought. The previous record for the earliest galaxy dated to 320 million years post-Big Bang. The same study also identified the second oldest-known galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-1, smaller and less massive. The findings challenge existing theories about galaxy formation and suggest a more complex and luminous early universe.

Early \u201cimpossibly massive\u201d headlines came from uncertain masses; after spectroscopy and better SEDs, the crisis language softened\u2014but the *bright-end* UV luminosity function remains high relative to many models. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search13\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n- **What\u2019s credibly challenged.** Not \u039bCDM per se, but **galaxy-formation efficiency** and feedback at very high redshift (IMF, bursty SFR, dust/nebular line corrections, AGN contributions) used in current models. Think \u201castrophysics under \u039bCDM needs revision,\u201d not \u201ccosmology is broken.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201\n\n# 2) Reionization started earlier/more patchily than expected\n- **What JWST saw.** Robust Ly-\u03b1 detections at z~13 from JADES and others imply sizable ionized bubbles much earlier than many models predicted. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search13\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n- **Why controversial.** Ly-\u03b1 is easily suppressed by neutral IGM; seeing it this strong so early tightens the timeline for ionizing-photon production (stars and/or AGN) and demands efficient escape fractions or clustered sources.  \n- **What\u2019s credibly challenged.** **Simple reionization histories** that turn on later and evolve smoothly. The data push toward **earlier, patchier reionization** and higher early UV production efficiency. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search13\ue201\n\n# 3) Rapid chemical enrichment and dust at z \u2273 10\n- **What JWST/ALMA found.** Oxygen ([O III] 88 \u03bcm) detected in JADES-GS-z14-0\u2014<300 Myr after the Big Bang\u2014plus multiple JWST detections of PAH-like dust features at z~6\u20138. These imply **multiple stellar generations** and quick metal/dust production far earlier than many enrichment recipes assume. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search6\ue201  \n- **What\u2019s credibly challenged.** **Metal and dust buildup timescales** (AGB vs. SN dust yields, grain growth) in early-Universe models; the enrichment seems faster than many pre-JWST prescriptions. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue201\n\n# 4) Very early black holes and AGN demographics\n- **What JWST saw.** Active SMBHs within \u2272600 Myr (e.g., CEERS-1019 at z\u22488.7), and growing evidence that faint/obscured AGN exist at higher redshift than we could see before\u2014though truly *z>10* AGN are still rare and debated. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search17\ue201  \n- **Why controversial.** To make ~10\u2076\u201310\u2079 M\u2299 black holes so fast, we need either **massive seeds** or **(super-)Eddington growth** phases beyond standard assumptions.  \n- **What\u2019s credibly challenged.** **BH seeding and early growth pathways** (direct-collapse seeds, duty cycles, feedback coupling). JWST is forcing more aggressive early growth models but hasn\u2019t falsified \u039bCDM. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search14\ue201\n\n# 5) Mature morphologies early (bars/disks, bulge\u2013disk structure)\n- **What JWST saw.** Bars and settled disks appear by z\u22733\u20136; even core\u2013disc systems by z~7.4. These features generally require dynamical settling, previously expected later. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn1search15\ue201  \n- **What\u2019s credibly challenged.** **Timescales for disk settling and secular evolution** in simulations; bar formation and inside-out growth likely need to start earlier/faster.\n\n# 6) Massive quiescent systems by z~7\n- **What JWST saw.** Spectroscopic identification of **quiescent** (quenched) or rapidly quenching galaxies within ~800 Myr, with high stellar masses and compact sizes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- **What\u2019s credibly challenged.** **Quenching physics and baryon conversion efficiency** very early on (feedback strength, halo assembly history). Some papers note this may \u201cstrain\u201d baseline models unless efficiencies are higher than assumed.\n\n# 7) The Hubble-constant (H\u2080) debate: JWST *strengthened* the tension\n- **What JWST did.** High-resolution JWST Cepheid imaging in SN-Ia hosts ruled out HST crowding/photometry systematics as the cause of the local-vs-CMB H\u2080 discrepancy (\u22488.2\u03c3 rejection of the \u201ccrowding\u201d fix). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n- **What\u2019s credibly challenged.** Claims that the Hubble tension is just a **HST Cepheid bias**. JWST backs the SH0ES distance ladder, so the tension with Planck \u039bCDM persists and remains a legitimate target for **new physics or subtle cross-calibration issues**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line (what *isn\u2019t* challenged)\n- **\u039bCDM itself remains intact.** The weight of evidence points to **modeling of early star/galaxy/black-hole physics**\u2014IMF, star-formation efficiency, feedback, dust/metals, escape fractions\u2014rather than a breakdown of the background cosmology. (Early \u201cbreak \u039bCDM\u201d headlines were driven by photometric masses and small samples; spectroscopy and improved selections tempered that.) \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn1search12\ue201\n\n## Common pitfalls you can safely ignore\n- \u201cJWST disproved the Big Bang\u201d \u2014 it didn\u2019t. The record-high-z galaxies and early metals demand faster astrophysics, not a replacement of the hot Big Bang framework. The most robust results are spectroscopic and fit within \u039bCDM once you adjust the *baryonic* prescriptions. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search7\ue201\n\n---\n\n### What to watch next (my forward-looking take)\n1) **Bright-end UVLF vs. models:** expect updated sims (IMF variations, burstiness, AGN contamination) and Roman+JWST synergy to pin this down. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue201  \n2) **Earliest Ly-\u03b1 and bubble mapping:** larger spectroscopic samples will map reionization topology directly. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search13\ue201  \n3) **BH seeds:** more z>9 AGN and X-ray/IR constraints on obscured growth to decide between massive seeds vs. super-Eddington phases. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search17\ue201  \n4) **Early quenching:** confirm how common truly quiescent z>6\u20137 systems are and which feedback shuts them down. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202JWST: recent, accessible
