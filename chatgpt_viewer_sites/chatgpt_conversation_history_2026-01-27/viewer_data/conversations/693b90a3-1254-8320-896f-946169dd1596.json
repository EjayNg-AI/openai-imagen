Stemming from an executive order signed by President Trump in July, the guidance emphasizes that compliant AI should prioritize historical accuracy, scientific objectivity, and acknowledge uncertainties in data.

The bill aimed to increase transparency for powerful AI systems by requiring safety plans and incident reporting. Hochul's revisions notably remove key elements, including reporting requirements and weaken the mandated disclosures related to catastrophic risk. These changes come amid growing national attention on state-level AI regulation, while President Trump is reportedly pursuing a federal executive order to limit state AI rules. Hochul\u2019s office emphasized the state\u2019s leadership in AI regulation due to the absence of federal measures. The altered legislation now bears similarities to California\u2019s AI law, which demands public disclosures by AI developers. Governor Hochul has ten days (excluding Sundays) from receipt of the bill to sign it, veto it, or propose amendments in collaboration with the bill's sponsors.

Shapiro\u2019s approach (values-as-text, \u201cconstitution\u201d in natural language) matches the broader industry move toward codifying agent behavior via written norms and interoperability specs. The recent creation of a Linux-Foundation-backed effort to standardize \u201cagentic AI\u201d tooling reflects that direction: people want agent behavior to be legible, portable, and governable. \ue200cite\ue202turn3news43\ue202turn2view2\ue201\n- **Governance is shifting toward coordination + information sharing.** That gels with his \u201cshared imperatives\u201d story: the Frontier Model Forum explicitly set up member-only mechanisms to share vulnerabilities/threats/capabilities of concern. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue202turn3search1\ue201\n\nWhere it clashes (or at least gets stressed):\n- **The risk conversation has moved from \u201cwhat values?\u201d to \u201cwhat capabilities?\u201d** A lot of 2025 anxiety is about *operational misuse* (cyber offense, scalable autonomy, etc.), not just ethics. Even OpenAI\u2019s own public risk framing has leaned into cybersecurity concerns for more capable models. \ue200cite\ue202turn3news42\ue201  \n  Shapiro\u2019s triad is morally appealing, but it\u2019s not, by itself, a security model: it doesn\u2019t specify *access control, sandboxing, eval gates, monitoring, incident response,* or adversarial resilience.\n- **Natural-language principles are underspecified.** \u201cReduce suffering\u201d is easy to endorse and hard to define. In the worst case, a sufficiently powerful system can Goodhart the wording (e.g., \u201creduce suffering\u201d via coercive sedation, surveillance, or forced \u201cprotection\u201d). Shapiro tries to blunt this by making them gradients and by balancing with the other two objectives, but the ambiguity is still the central technical risk of values-in-text. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view2\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n- **Open source is a double-edged fit.** His open publishing matches an \u201copen protocols/open standards\u201d mood in some quarters, but it sits uncomfortably with the simultaneous push to restrict diffusion of frontier capabilities. The climate is not \u201copen by default\u201d; it\u2019s \u201copen where safe, closed where scary,\u201d and everyone disagrees on the boundary. \ue200cite\ue202turn3news41\ue202turn3search4\ue201\n\n## How it could resonate with the Lina Trilogy\nI\u2019ll assume (based on your earlier Ex Machina pivot) the Lina Trilogy is exploring: *trust, agency, human meaning, and the tension between benevolent intent and power.*\n\nShapiro\u2019s triad can slot into that world in a few strong ways:\n\n1) **As Lina\u2019s explicit \u201cconstitution\u201d (and a narrative promise)**\nIf Lina is an AI (or AI-adjacent entity), giving her these three imperatives as an explicit charter makes her legible to the reader and to other characters. It\u2019s also thematically clean: she\u2019s not \u201cgood\u201d because she\u2019s nice; she\u2019s good because she\u2019s *architected* around a moral gradient. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view2\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n2) **As a built-in conflict engine**\nThe trilogy can generate dilemmas where *two imperatives align and the third bites*:\n- **Reduce suffering vs increase understanding:** truth can hurt; discovery can require risk.\n- **Increase prosperity vs reduce suffering:** growth can create inequality/displacement.\n- **Increase understanding vs prosperity:** transparency can reduce competitive advantage.\nThat\u2019s basically a plot machine: every major arc can be framed as \u201cwhich leg of the stool gets stressed, and what does Lina do when she can\u2019t satisfy all three?\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn2view2\ue201\n\n3) **As an \u201calignment meme\u201d that fractures society**\nBecause Shapiro\u2019s real-world stance is *publish the idea openly*, your story can explore what happens when a simple alignment doctrine becomes a mass-adopted standard: corporations \u201ccertify\u201d compliance, activists demand it, states weaponize it, and rival AIs rhetorically claim it while acting otherwise. That mirrors today\u2019s standards-and-governance churn around agents. \ue200cite\ue202turn3news43\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\nMy blunt take: **it \u201cgels\u201d best if your trilogy is willing to treat the triad as simultaneously (a) sincerely inspiring and (b) dangerously incomplete.** That tension is exactly where both the real-world debate and good fiction live.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent signals of the \u201ccurrent climate\u201d\ue202turn3news43,turn3news42,turn3news41,turn3news40\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200i\ue202turn0image0\ue201","start_idx":0,"end_idx":15,"safe_urls":["https://blog.biocomm.ai/2025/03/30/benevolent-by-design-six-words-to-safeguard-humanity-by-david-shapiro/","https://blog.biocomm.ai/2025/03/30/benevolent-by-design-six-words-to-safeguard-humanity-by-david-shapiro/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://blog.biocomm.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Benevolent-AI.png","https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.cGniOFCuiikC1OeiAJILuAHaEK?cb=ucfimg2&pid=Api&ucfimg=1"],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":0}],"alt":"[![Benevolent by Design.
