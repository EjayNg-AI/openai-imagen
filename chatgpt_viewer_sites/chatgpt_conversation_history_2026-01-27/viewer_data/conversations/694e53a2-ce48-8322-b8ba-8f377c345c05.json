Missingness, impossible values (negative distance, zero duration, absurd fares)\n  - Distribution tails and clear filtering rules\n- Produce a short \u201cEDA findings\u201d section (markdown in README or a report).\n\n**Day 3 \u2014 Modeling**\n- Build a baseline (e.g., linear model) then a stronger model (e.g., gradient-boosted trees).\n- Define metrics:\n  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n- Do a **time-aware split** (train on earlier, test on later) to avoid leakage.\n\n**Day 4 \u2014 Data pipeline**\n- Implement a repeatable ETL pipeline:\n  - Option A: **Apache Spark** (PySpark) for transformations + Parquet outputs\n  - Option B: DuckDB + Parquet (still \u201cdata engineering flavored\u201d, less setup)\n- Output a curated dataset with explicit schema + data validation checks.\n\n**Day 5 \u2014 Storage + analytics**\n- Stand up **PostgreSQL** via Docker Compose.\n- Load curated data into Postgres and write 5\u20138 meaningful SQL queries:\n  - avg fare by pickup zone/time bucket\n  - top OD (origin-destination) pairs by volume\n  - outlier trip detection counts, etc.\n\n**Day 6 \u2014 Serving + packaging**\n- Build a small **Application Programming Interface (API)** (FastAPI recommended):\n  - `/predict_duration`\n  - `/predict_fare`\n- Package with Docker; document exactly how to run end-to-end.\n- Add a minimal Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (GitHub Actions) to run tests + lint.\n\n### Required deliverables\n- `README.md` with **one-command** local run steps (Docker Compose)\n- EDA notebook + summary write-up\n- Training script + saved model artifact\n- ETL pipeline (Spark/DuckDB) producing curated Parquet\n- Postgres loader + SQL queries\n- FastAPI inference service + Dockerfile\n- Tests (even small): at least pipeline sanity + one model inference test\n- Docstrings + type hints in core modules\n\n### Stretch goals (choose 1\u20132)\n- Model tracking with MLflow (Machine Learning Flow)\n- Basic drift checks (feature distribution shift)\n- Cloud deploy (AWS ECS Fargate / Azure Container Apps / GCP Cloud Run)\n\n---\n\n## Practice Assignment 2 \u2014 US Flights: Delay Risk Scoring (Classification + Monitoring)\n\n### Real-world dataset\n**US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Airline On-Time Performance** data (scheduled vs actual times, delays, cancellations, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search17\ue201  \nBTS also provides field listings and definitions (useful for feature selection). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search9\ue201\n\n### Problem statement\nYou\u2019re building a risk-scoring service for a travel platform:\n- Predict whether a flight will be **\u201c15+ minutes late\u201d** (binary classification) and/or **canceled**.\n- Provide a calibrated probability and a short explanation of top contributing factors.\n\n### What this tests\n- Classification + class imbalance + calibration\n- A \u201creal-ish\u201d ML product surface (API + logging + monitoring hooks)\n- SQL + NoSQL usage in a sensible way\n- Pipeline orchestration and reproducibility\n\n### 6-day structure\n**Day 1 \u2014 Data acquisition + schema**\n- Download a limited slice (e.g., 3 months) from BTS.\n- Create a data dictionary note: feature types, categorical cardinalities, missingness.\n\n**Day 2 \u2014 EDA**\n- Visualize delay rate by:\n  - carrier, airport, route, time-of-day, day-of-week, seasonality\n- Identify leakage risks (e.g., features only known after departure).\n\n**Day 3 \u2014 Modeling**\n- Baseline: logistic regression.\n- Stronger: gradient boosted trees.\n- Metrics:\n  - Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)\n  - F1 score (harmonic mean of precision/recall)\n  - Calibration (reliability curve or Brier score)\n- Use a time split (train earlier months, test later).\n\n**Day 4 \u2014 Pipeline + validation**\n- Build an ETL pipeline and add data quality checks:\n  - Great Expectations (optional) or your own validation module\n- Produce a \u201cfeatures\u201d table and a \u201clabels\u201d table.\n\n**Day 5 \u2014 SQL + NoSQL**\n- SQL (Postgres): store curated features and batch scoring outputs.\n- NoSQL (MongoDB or DynamoDB): store **inference request/response logs** and model version metadata (this is a realistic NoSQL use case).\n\n**Day 6 \u2014 Deployable service**\n- FastAPI endpoint: `/predict_delay_risk`\n- Return:\n  - probability\n  - predicted class\n  - model version\n- Dockerize the app + databases with Compose.\n- Add CI and a small load test script (even a simple `hey`/`wrk` run is fine).\n\n### Required deliverables\n- Clear README with local run + example requests (curl)\n- EDA notebook + 1\u20132 pages of conclusions\n- Training/evaluation scripts + saved model\n- Postgres schema + SQL analytics queries\n- NoSQL logging implementation\n- Docker Compose for full stack\n- CI: tests + build\n\n### Stretch goals\n- Add a batch scoring job (daily) and write results back to Postgres\n- Add a lightweight monitoring report:\n  - data drift summary\n  - prediction distribution shift\n- Cloud deploy + minimal \u201crunbook\u201d (how to rollback / redeploy)\n\n---\n\n## How to grade yourself (quick rubric)\n- **Reproducibility (30%)**: one command to run pipeline + service, deterministic outputs, clean env setup\n- **Data handling (20%)**: sane cleaning rules, leakage awareness, validation checks\n- **Modeling (20%)**: baselines + improvement + correct metrics + honest limitations\n- **Software engineering (20%)**: modular code, tests, logging, docstrings, Git hygiene\n- **MLOps (10%)**: Docker, CI, deployment story (even if \u201clocal only\u201d, it\u2019s coherent)\n\nIf you want, I can also give you a **reference repo structure** (folders + naming + Makefile targets) that fits both assignments cleanly, so you can practice under realistic constraints without reinventing scaffolding."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201","start_idx":415,"end_idx":447,"safe_urls":["https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page","https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([New York City Government](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"TLC Trip Record Data","url":"https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Trip Record Data Download Links \u00b7 Yellow Taxi Trip Records (PARQUET) \u00b7 Green Taxi Trip Records (PARQUET) \u00b7 For-Hire Vehicle Trip Records (PARQUET) \u00b7 High Volume For ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"TLC Trip Record Data","url":"https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pickup and drop-off dates/times, pickup and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate ...Read more","attribution":"New York City Government"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"New York City Government"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201","start_idx":585,"end_idx":604,"safe_urls":["https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf","https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([New York City Government](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Data Dictionary \u2013 Yellow Taxi Trip Records March 18, 2025","url":"https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1742920146.0,"snippet":"18 Mar 2025 \u2014 tpep_pickup_datetime.
