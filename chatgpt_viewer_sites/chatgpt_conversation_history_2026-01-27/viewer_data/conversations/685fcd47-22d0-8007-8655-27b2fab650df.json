Each item is tied to an operational or strategic pain-point that has become acute over the past 18 months.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Immediate relief from supply-chain bottlenecks  \n* **Chronic NVIDIA shortages.** Even tier-1 customers have struggled to secure H100 / H200 and the forthcoming Blackwell GPUs in the volumes needed for frontier models; export-control variants (H20, H800) are also in short supply. One high-profile casualty this week was DeepSeek\u2019s R2 model, delayed explicitly because \u201cH20 processors are now in short supply.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n* **Google\u2019s under-utilised capacity.** TPU v5e/v5p clusters were built for the internal Gemini programme; Google Cloud is now actively courting external renters (Apple, Anthropic, and \u2013 per Friday\u2019s leak \u2013 OpenAI). TPU slots can therefore be obtained faster than comparable H100 pods in many regions. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n**Net effect:** Diversifying gives OpenAI a queue-jump on compute allocation and de-risks US export-control surprises that disproportionately hit NVIDIA SKUs.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Lower dollar cost per token \u2013 especially for inference  \n| Metric (March 2025 cloud list price) | Google TPU v5e | Azure ND-H100 (NVIDIA) | \u0394 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| On-demand price / chip-hour | **\u2248 $1.20** | \u2248 $12.84 | >10 \u00d7 cheaper |\n| Inference cost (Llama-2-70B, 1 M output tokens, 3-yr CUD) | **\u2248 $0.30** | \u2248 $1.00 | 3 \u00d7 cheaper |  \n(TPU figures: Google CloudExpat benchmark.) \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n\nOpenAI\u2019s own economics echo this: Reuters reports the company \u201chopes the TPUs will help lower the cost of inference,\u201d its single largest operating expense. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Better energy efficiency \u2192 lower OPEX & ESG optics  \n* Google says TPU v5e draws **~5 \u00d7 less power than an H100** for the same transformer workload. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search0\ue201  \n* New inference-only \u201cIronwood\u201d TPUs (April 2025) push that envelope further, at ~30 \u00d7 the perf/W of first-gen TPUs. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \n\nFor a service like ChatGPT that idles vast fleets 24/7, electricity and cooling dominate TCO; a few pence per kWh compounds into millions of dollars annually.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Large-scale, low-latency interconnect  \nEach TPU v5p pod stitches **8,960 chips** via a 3-D torus at **4.8 Tbps per chip**, delivering ~460 PFLOPS sustained BF16. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue201  The mesh avoids the all-to-all congestion that crops up on GPU clusters once you exceed roughly 8,000 H100s, so extreme-scale \u201cMixture-of-Experts\u201d or 500 B-parameter dense models can train with fewer cross-node stalls.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Software-stack hedging & vendor leverage  \n* **CUDA moat erosion.** PyTorch/XLA and JAX have matured; most common kernels now autotune across GPU \u2194 TPU. Porting friction is shrinking, and future-proofing against a CUDA monopoly matters for long-term bargaining power.  \n* **Negotiation leverage.** Reuters notes the very reason OpenAI is taping-out its own Broadcom\u2013TSMC 3-nm chip (\u201cProject Phoenix\u201d) is to \u201cstrengthen its negotiating leverage with other suppliers.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  Demonstrating credible volume on TPUs accelerates that leverage today, without waiting for 2026 silicon.\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Risk-pooling against geopolitical or pricing shocks  \nNVIDIA\u2019s list price has swung wildly (and upward) with each export-control revision, while TPUs, AWS Trainium 2 and AMD MI300 present alternative hedges. Maintaining **multi-ISA** readiness means any single vendor\u2019s margin grabs, fab hiccups, or sanctions hit less hard.\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Ancillary ecosystem wins  \n* **Google Cloud concessions.** To land marquee customers, GCP is bundling TPU deals with data-egress discounts, BigQuery credits, and Vertex AI pipelines \u2013 perks Microsoft/Azure may not match.  \n* **Sustainability branding.** Google\u2019s carbon-neutral data-centre commitment lets OpenAI claim lower Scope-2 emissions for the same workload \u2013 a non-trivial selling point for enterprise customers in regulated sectors.\n\n---\n\n## Caveats & strategic wrinkles\n* **IP-exposure concerns.** Serving inference on a competitor\u2019s hardware raises questions about side-channel leakage and observability; OpenAI will insist on strict tenancy isolation and encryption-in-use.  \n* **Software maturity.** CUDA still leads for bleeding-edge research ops (custom kernels, debugger tooling). Porting very-new architectures (e.g., sparse attention variants) can lag by weeks on TPUs.  \n* **\u201cNot Google\u2019s best chips.\u201d** The Information says Google withholds its newest Trillium/Ironwood-at-scale clusters from direct rivals. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  OpenAI therefore trades some absolute peak throughput for cost and availability.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \n**Diversifying into TPUs gives OpenAI an immediate cost-per-token advantage, mitigates supply and policy shocks, and strengthens its hand in price negotiations \u2013 while also laying groundwork for a post-CUDA, multi-accelerator future.** The competitive risks are real, but in today\u2019s compute-constrained market the upsides outweigh them for any player aiming to scale GPT-class models
