This report reviews the latest advancements across hardware, software, and commercial domains, and examines how industries are beginning to harness quantum technology. It also discusses the remaining challenges and estimates when quantum computing might become commercially viable. The findings are organized into sections on hardware breakthroughs, software/algorithm innovations, commercial efforts, industry adoption, key challenges, and the outlook for mainstream use.\n\n## Hardware Breakthroughs in Qubits and Architectures  \nModern quantum hardware has seen **significant breakthroughs in qubit stability, error rates, and new architectures**:  \n\n- **Improved Qubit Coherence and Fidelity**: Researchers have steadily extended how long qubits maintain quantum states (coherence) and improved gate fidelities. For instance, superconducting qubit systems recently achieved two-qubit gate fidelities around 99.9% and coherence times on the order of 1 millisecond\u301039\u2020L115-L123\u3011\u301039\u2020L139-L147\u3011 \u2013 a major improvement enabling more complex circuits before errors set in. These gains result from better materials, fabrication, and design of qubits.  \n\n- **Progress in Quantum Error Correction**: A long-sought goal has been to correct quantum errors faster than they occur. In 2023\u201324, Google Quantum AI demonstrated a milestone: as they increased the number of physical qubits in an error-correcting code, the overall error rate of a logical qubit **decreased** (showing the code surpassing the error threshold)\u301031\u2020L161-L169\u3011. This result suggests that adding more qubits for error correction can eventually yield arbitrarily long computations with negligible errors, paving the way toward fault-tolerant quantum computers. While full error correction is not yet achieved, experiments with small logical qubits (using surface codes, etc.) indicate it is becoming feasible in hardware.  \n\n- **Superconducting Qubits**: Superconducting circuits (used by IBM, Google, etc.) remain a leading platform. They operate by trapping currents in Josephson junction loops at millikelvin temperatures. The advantage of superconducting qubits is fast gate speeds (nanosecond operations) and the ability to leverage semiconductor fabrication techniques for scaling\u30101\u2020L69-L77\u3011. IBM, for example, has rapidly scaled its superconducting processors from 5 and 16 qubits a few years ago to **127 qubits (\u201cEagle\u201d) in 2021 and 433 qubits (\u201cOsprey\u201d) in 2022**\u301043\u2020L101-L109\u3011\u301043\u2020L109-L117\u3011. These larger chips mark a significant leap toward practical machines, and IBM\u2019s roadmap targets devices with thousands of qubits by the end of this decade. However, superconducting approaches face challenges in scaling: as qubit counts grow, issues of cross-talk, calibration complexity, and maintaining high fidelity arise\u301035\u2020L105-L113\u3011. The hardware also requires bulky cryogenic infrastructure to keep qubits cold and isolate them from noise. Despite these hurdles, steady improvements (including **automation of chip fabrication and packaging**) have kept superconducting qubits at the forefront of quantum hardware progress\u301034\u2020L1-L4\u3011\u301035\u2020L105-L113\u3011.\n\n- **Photonic Qubits**: Photonic quantum computing (using particles of light as qubits) has emerged as a promising alternative. Photonic systems have the appeal of operating at room temperature and easily networking over long distances (since photons can travel through fiber or free-space without significant decoherence)\u301033\u2020L85-L92\u3011. Companies like Xanadu and PsiQuantum are pursuing photonic architectures. **Photonic qubits** can be used to create highly entangled states (e.g. cluster states) for computation, and they naturally interface with quantum communication. A key challenge, however, is that two-photon gates are often probabilistic \u2013 achieving deterministic interactions between photons typically requires complex resource states or measurement-based schemes\u301033\u2020L79-L87\u3011\u301033\u2020L85-L92\u3011. Additionally, photon losses in optical components can lead to errors, and generating identical single photons on demand is non-trivial. Recent advances have focused on improved photon sources and error-correcting codes tailored for photonic qubits (for example, new photonic error-correction codes claim to need far fewer physical qubits)\u30104\u2020L1-L8\u3011. Photonic approaches are still in early hardware development (no general-purpose photonic quantum computer has reached the qubit counts of superconducting or trapped-ion systems yet), but they hold long-term potential for **scalable, modular quantum processors** that integrate with existing fiber networks.\n\n- **Trapped Ions and Neutral Atoms**: Beyond superconductors and photons, other architectures like trapped-ion and neutral-atom qubits have achieved important milestones. **Trapped-ion qubits** (pioneered by IonQ, Quantinuum, and academic labs) use individual ions held in electromagnetic traps and manipulated with lasers. They feature extremely high fidelities \u2013 two-qubit gate errors below 0.1% (the lowest among current technologies) \u2013 and very long coherence times (often seconds or more)\u301035\u2020L153-L161\u3011\u301057\u2020L161-L169\u3011. Ion traps also allow *all-to-all* connectivity in a small chain, simplifying certain algorithms. The trade-off is that operations are slower (milliseconds per gate) and scaling to very large numbers of ions in one trap is difficult beyond dozens of qubits. To scale, ion-trap developers are exploring modular systems with multiple traps linked by photonic interconnects. **Neutral-atom qubits** (e.g. Rydberg atom arrays from startups like Pasqal and QuEra) use optical tweezers to trap hundreds of atoms in programmable grids. They have demonstrated **scaling advantage** \u2013 neutral atom platforms have already reached 100\u2013200 atom qubits in laboratory settings \u2013 and they can achieve long coherence (on the order of minutes under certain conditions)\u301035\u2020L139-L148\u3011. At the same time, their two-qubit gate error rates are currently higher than those of ions or superconductors, and controlling thousands of individual atoms and lasers remains a challenge\u301035\u2020L139-L148\u3011\u301035\u2020L147-L152\u3011. Still, recent neutral-atom results have been encouraging, showing that 1000+ qubit systems may be attainable with this approach in the near future.  \n\n- **Topological Qubits**: A more radical hardware approach is being pursued by Microsoft and a few research groups \u2013 **topological quantum computing**. The idea is to encode qubits into exotic quantum states of matter (such as Majorana zero modes) that are inherently protected from local sources of noise. In theory, topological qubits could have far lower error rates because the qubit\u2019s information is stored non-locally (making it immune to small perturbations). Microsoft has invested in this vision, aiming to create qubits from certain superconducting-semiconductor structures where electrons follow \u201ctopological\u201d paths. If successful, these qubits could be more stable and require less error correction\u301058\u2020L299-L307\u3011. However, this approach has proven extremely challenging \u2013 the existence of the necessary quasiparticles (e.g. Majorana fermions) and their controlled braiding are still being verified experimentally. To date, no operational topological qubit has been realized, but in 2022 Microsoft reported some evidence consistent with the signatures of topological states. This area remains high-risk, high-reward: it hasn\u2019t delivered usable qubits yet, but it could be a game-changer for scalability in the long run\u301058\u2020L299-L307\u3011.\n\n- **Modular and Networked Quantum Systems**: To overcome the scaling limits of single-chip quantum processors, researchers have also explored *distributed quantum computing*. A major breakthrough was reported in early 2025 by an Oxford University team, who **successfully linked two separate quantum processors into one networked machine**\u301065\u2020L29-L37\u3011\u301065\u2020L49-L57\u3011. Using a photonic interface, they entangled qubits between two independent trapped-ion modules, effectively performing quantum logic operations across the modules as if they were in one processor. This is the first demonstration of a **fully connected multi-processor quantum computer**, addressing the \u201cscalability problem\u201d by networking smaller devices rather than building one huge device\u301065\u2020L49-L57\u3011. In theory, there is no limit to how many modules could be linked in this way\u301065\u2020L51-L59\u3011. This modular approach foreshadows a future **quantum internet** or distributed quantum supercomputer, where qubit nodes are connected by fiber-optic links. It indicates that *quantum coherence and entanglement can be maintained across physically separated processors*, an essential step toward scaling to millions of qubits. Companies like IBM have also hinted at plans to use modular architectures (for example, IBM\u2019s future roadmap includes coupling multiple chips)\u301043\u2020L131-L138\u3011. These advances suggest that rather than a monolithic quantum chip, the first large-scale quantum computers may resemble clusters of smaller quantum modules networked together.  \n\nOverall, hardware innovations in the last five years have expanded qubit counts (crossing the 100- and 400-qubit milestones), improved qubit quality (longer coherence and higher fidelity), and demonstrated new ways to link and protect qubits (error correction and modular entanglement). Different technology tracks \u2013 superconducting, photonic, ion-based, and beyond \u2013 continue to coexist, each with distinct strengths. **No single architecture has yet solved all challenges** (fast, low-error, highly connected, easily scalable), but the combination of incremental improvements and novel architectures is pushing the field closer to the fault-tolerant threshold needed for useful computing.\n\n## Software and Algorithmic Advancements  \nProgress in quantum computing isn\u2019t just about hardware; there have also been significant **advancements in quantum algorithms, software, and demonstrations of quantum advantage**. Researchers have developed new algorithms and techniques to harness NISQ-era devices, explored quantum machine learning and cryptography, and achieved milestone demonstrations where quantum machines beat classical ones for specific tasks.\n\n- **New Quantum Algorithms and Complexity Reduction**: Building on foundational algorithms like Shor\u2019s (for factoring) and Grover\u2019s (for unstructured search), the past five years have seen many new quantum algorithms tailored to real-world problems. A key focus has been algorithms for **optimization, simulation, and machine learning** that can run on noisy intermediate-scale hardware. For example, variational algorithms (like VQE \u2013 Variational Quantum Eigensolver, and QAOA \u2013 Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) were refined and applied to problems in chemistry and finance. In 2020, researchers from Goldman Sachs and IBM developed an improved algorithm for options pricing that *dramatically reduced* the number of qubits and gates required\u30108\u2020L762-L770\u3011. By using quantum amplitude estimation in a clever, low-depth way, they showed a path to quantum advantage in Monte Carlo simulations for finance with far fewer resources than previously thought\u30108\u2020L762-L769\u3011. In 2021, JPMorgan Chase and QC Ware similarly collaborated on quantum algorithms for risk analysis, introducing methods to cut down hardware requirements for quantum Monte Carlo calculations\u30108\u2020L767-L770\u3011. These developments are important because they make practical applications more reachable on near-term devices. Additionally, improved compilers and error mitigation software have been created to squeeze the most performance out of noisy hardware \u2013 for instance, techniques to reduce circuit depth or adjust for systematic errors, which effectively extend the capabilities of current quantum processors.\n\n- **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**: The intersection of quantum computing and machine learning has grown into a vibrant research area. Quantum machine learning aims to use quantum computers to accelerate tasks like classification, regression, clustering, or generative modeling. In recent years, researchers proposed quantum analogs of classical ML models (quantum neural networks, quantum support vector machines, etc.), and some proof-of-concept implementations have been run on hardware. One promising result showed that a *quantum kernel method* could outperform classical algorithms on a limited dataset for pattern recognition, hinting at potential advantages in data analysis\u30107\u2020L95-L103\u3011\u30107\u2020L119-L127\u3011. Hybrid quantum-classical approaches \u2013 where a quantum circuit is trained as part of a larger classical ML model \u2013 have also been explored. While no clear, at-scale quantum advantage in ML has been demonstrated yet, small-scale experiments indicate that quantum models can capture complex data relationships differently than classical ones. Integration of quantum computing with AI workflows is anticipated to grow; for example, quantum computers might one day accelerate the training of large-scale machine learning models or improve combinatorial optimization in AI (as hinted by research into quantum-enhanced feature selection and generative models). For now, quantum ML algorithms are mostly tested on simulators or few-qubit devices due to hardware limitations, but the **conceptual groundwork and software libraries (like TensorFlow Quantum and PennyLane)** are in place, so that as hardware improves, quantum ML could become one of the first broad domains of application.\n\n- **Quantum Cryptography and Security**: On the flip side of algorithms, **quantum computing poses threats to current cryptography** and also offers new cryptographic tools. The looming ability of quantum computers to run Shor\u2019s algorithm to factor large numbers and break RSA/ECC encryption has spurred a global push toward **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** \u2013 developing new encryption methods that quantum algorithms can\u2019t easily crack. In parallel, there\u2019s growing deployment of **quantum cryptography**, specifically quantum key distribution (QKD), which uses quantum physics to secure communications. In 2022, JPMorgan Chase demonstrated a *first-of-its-kind, production-grade QKD network* for secure data center communication\u301069\u2020L1-L4\u3011. This trial showed that QKD can be integrated into a financial institution\u2019s infrastructure to protect sensitive transactions with theoretically unbreakable security, illustrating real-world progress in quantum-safe communication. Moreover, quantum algorithms have been devised for tasks like secure multi-party computation and random number generation, which can enhance cybersecurity. On the defensive side, governments and standards bodies (like NIST) have been standardizing new PQC algorithms (notably lattice-based cryptography) in anticipation of future quantum computers. In summary, the past five years have seen quantum computing influence the security landscape: it has accelerated efforts to **\u201cencrypt now, decrypt never\u201d** by adopting quantum-resistant methods, while also enabling new cryptographic techniques using quantum principles. This dual trend will continue as quantum capabilities grow.\n\n- **Demonstrated Quantum Advantage**: A landmark of the last five years was the first definitive proof that a quantum computer can outperform classical supercomputers on a specific task \u2013 a phenomenon known as **quantum supremacy** or quantum advantage. In 2019, Google\u2019s 53-qubit *Sycamore* processor made headlines by completing a carefully chosen random circuit sampling computation in **200 seconds**, a task they estimated would take a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer at least **10,000 years** to simulate\u301045\u2020L133-L141\u3011. This experiment, published in *Nature*, was the first realization of quantum supremacy\u301045\u2020L133-L141\u3011. (IBM subsequently argued the task could be done in a few days with a different classical approach, but even so, the experiment showed a quantum speedup of many orders of magnitude.) Since then, other quantum advantage demonstrations have followed. In late 2020, a team in China used a photonic device (*Jiuzhang*) to perform boson sampling (a complex photonic computation) with 76 detected photons, far beyond what any classical algorithm can handle, thus claiming photonic quantum advantage. In 2022, Canada\u2019s Xanadu improved on this with *Borealis*, a programmable photonic quantum computer that carried out Gaussian boson sampling with up to **219 photons**, significantly surpassing prior records\u301067\u2020L88-L96\u3011\u301067\u2020L103-L111\u3011. These photonic experiments further cemented that quantum devices can outperform classical ones on well-chosen tasks. It\u2019s important to note that these tasks (random circuit sampling, boson sampling) are somewhat esoteric and not directly practical \u2013 they were chosen primarily as benchmarks. However, they are crucial *proof-of-principle* milestones. They validate that the quantum hardware is working as expected at a computational level no classical machine can match, and they provide confidence that as devices improve, more **practical** problems (like chemistry or optimization problems) will eventually reach quantum advantage. In 2023, for example, Google reported it had **error-corrected a logical qubit better than a physical qubit**, which, combined with increased qubit counts, points toward quantum advantage in useful tasks in the future\u301031\u2020L161-L169\u3011. Overall, the concept of quantum advantage moved from theory to reality in the past five years \u2013 a major scientific achievement. \n\n- **Software and Developer Tools**: Alongside algorithms, the ecosystem of quantum **software frameworks and languages** has matured. IBM\u2019s Qiskit, Google\u2019s Cirq, Microsoft\u2019s Q# and Quantum Development Kit, and other platforms (like Braket SDK from AWS, and Pennylane for hybrid ML) have expanded features to make writing and optimizing quantum programs easier. They support higher-level abstractions, circuit optimizations, and hybrid classical-quantum workflows. There\u2019s also been progress in quantum error **mitigation** techniques \u2013 software methods to reduce error impact without full error correction, such as zero-noise extrapolation and probabilistic error cancellation, which have been demonstrated experimentally to improve the accuracy of NISQ computations. These tools are crucial for bridging the gap between algorithm theory and what today\u2019s hardware can actually run. The result is that more developers and researchers (even those without deep quantum physics backgrounds) can start exploring quantum algorithms using high-level libraries and cloud-accessible machines.\n\nIn summary, quantum **software advances are keeping pace with hardware**. We now have a broader library of algorithms, some early use-case demonstrations (e.g. in finance and chemistry), better programming environments, and clear proof that quantum computers can beat classical ones at certain tasks. This growing algorithmic and software foundation will be vital for extracting value from quantum hardware as it continues to improve.\n\n## Commercial Efforts by Major Companies and Startups  \nOver the past five years, **big tech companies and startups alike have heavily invested in quantum computing**, driving a competitive and collaborative commercial ecosystem. Tech giants are building quantum hardware and cloud services, while many startups focus on specialized technologies or software. Here we outline the efforts of key players:\n\n- **IBM**: IBM has been a leader in quantum computing commercialization. It has built a fleet of superconducting quantum processors and made them accessible via the **IBM Quantum Experience** cloud platform since 2016. As of 2023, IBM has **over 20 quantum computers available on its cloud**, ranging from small 5-qubit devices for free educational use to cutting-edge 127-qubit and 433-qubit systems for clients\u301058\u2020L318-L327\u3011. IBM aggressively updates its hardware; in 2021 it unveiled *Eagle* (127 qubits), and in 2022 *Osprey* (433 qubits), which at that time was the largest general-purpose quantum processor ever built\u301043\u2020L101-L109\u3011\u301043\u2020L109-L117\u3011. The company\u2019s **quantum roadmap** aims to cross the 1,000-qubit milestone in 2023\u20132024 with the planned *Condor* chip, and to implement modular scaling techniques to reach even larger counts by 2025 and beyond. IBM is also pioneering metrics like **Quantum Volume** to quantify progress in both qubit count and quality \u2013 IBM systems have steadily increased quantum volume, indicating more complex algorithms can run with high success rates. On the software side, IBM\u2019s open-source Qiskit framework is widely used for quantum programming. IBM has fostered a broad ecosystem through the **IBM Quantum Network**, which now includes **210+ organizations (businesses, universities, startups)** collaborating on research and quantum application development\u301058\u2020L277-L285\u3011. This network approach has helped drive real-world experimentation on IBM hardware in domains like finance, chemistry, and machine learning. IBM\u2019s efforts are distinctly focused on superconducting qubits, but the company has also shown interest in other architectures via partnerships (e.g., IBM has funded research in neutral atoms and is exploring quantum communication links between superconducting processors). Overall, IBM\u2019s combination of advancing hardware, cloud accessibility, and partnerships has kept it at the forefront of the commercial quantum race.\n\n- **Google**: Google\u2019s Quantum AI division (Google QAI) made global headlines with its 2019 quantum supremacy announcement, and it continues to push the envelope in quantum computing R&D. Google focuses on **superconducting qubit** technology (like IBM) and has built several generations of processors (Bristlecone, Sycamore, and more recently a \u201cRainbow\u201d and \u201cWeber\u201d in lab, and **\u201cWeaver\u201d/\u201cWillow\u201d chips aimed at error correction**). After the 53-qubit *Sycamore* achieved supremacy\u301045\u2020L133-L141\u3011, Google\u2019s next big goal is to build a scalable, error-corrected quantum computer. In fact, Google has publicly set a **target of building a useful, large-scale quantum computer by 2029**\u301060\u2020L13-L16\u3011. To reach this, they are investigating **modular chips, better qubits, and extensive error correction**. In 2023, Google QAI demonstrated a logical qubit with lower error than the constituent physical qubits, validating their error-correction approach\u301031\u2020L161-L169\u3011. Hardware-wise, Google has been relatively quiet about qubit count increases (focusing more on quality), but it\u2019s reportedly working on integrating 100+ qubit devices. On the commercial front, Google provides access to its quantum processors through cloud partnerships (e.g., Google\u2019s quantum hardware is available via Google Cloud to select partners and through the Quantum Inspire program). However, unlike IBM and Amazon, Google does not yet offer broad public cloud access to its quantum machines; it collaborates with specific research partners instead. Google has also built a new quantum computing center in Santa Barbara, with expanded facilities to design and manufacture chips in-house. In terms of software, Google\u2019s Cirq framework and OpenFermion (for quantum chemistry) are widely used open-source tools. The company partners with institutions like NASA (which helped validate its supremacy experiment) and maintains collaborations with universities (e.g., Quantum AI campus partnerships)\u301057\u2020L136-L142\u3011. Google\u2019s efforts are somewhat less publicly service-oriented than IBM\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re more geared toward achieving a breakthrough (like a fault-tolerant prototype) and then presumably leveraging it via Google\u2019s own cloud offerings. Nonetheless, Google is clearly one of the major drivers of quantum computing progress, investing large resources into both the fundamental technology and its potential applications (such as quantum simulation for materials and AI).\n\n- **Microsoft**: Microsoft\u2019s quantum strategy is unique in that it is pursuing a **topological qubit** approach (as discussed in Hardware) and simultaneously building a cloud ecosystem for quantum software. Microsoft has yet to unveil a working high-qubit-count quantum processor of its own \u2013 the topological hardware has faced delays \u2013 but the company has not stood idle. Through **Azure Quantum**, launched in 2020, Microsoft provides a cloud platform where users can access quantum hardware from various partners (IonQ\u2019s ion traps, Quantinuum\u2019s ion traps, and QCI or Rigetti\u2019s superconducting devices, for example)\u301057\u2020L153-L161\u3011. This platform-agnostic approach lets Microsoft be a quantum service provider without finished hardware. Azure Quantum also features the **Quantum Development Kit (QDK)** with the Q# programming language, which integrates with Visual Studio and Jupyter notebooks\u301057\u2020L153-L161\u3011. Microsoft\u2019s goal is to familiarize developers with quantum programming now, using simulators and partner hardware, so that a community and codebase will be ready when its own quantum hardware comes online. In terms of hardware, Microsoft did announce in 2022 that it had achieved a milestone in creating and observing topological superconducting phases, which is a step toward qubits. Additionally, Microsoft Research continues to investigate other areas like cryogenic CMOS control and quantum error correction schemes (e.g., they contributed to methods like surface codes early on). Microsoft\u2019s quantum efforts also extend to quantum-inspired algorithms (using techniques from quantum theory to improve classical algorithms for tasks like optimization). Commercially, Microsoft has formed partnerships with industrial players (e.g., Pacific Northwest National Lab for chemistry simulations, and collaboration with NASA for space applications) to explore use cases on Azure Quantum. In summary, Microsoft is playing a **long game**: investing in a potentially revolutionary qubit technology while leveraging a cloud platform to stay relevant in the interim. If their topological qubits succeed, Microsoft could leapfrog in hardware. If not, Azure Quantum ensures Microsoft still has a stake by hosting others\u2019 quantum processors and controlling a popular software layer. \n\n- **Amazon (AWS)**: Amazon entered the quantum computing race in 2019 by announcing **Amazon Braket**, a quantum computing cloud service. Braket became fully available in 2020, providing a unified interface for users to run quantum algorithms on a variety of back-end quantum hardware from different providers\u301046\u2020L9-L17\u3011. Through Braket, one can access D-Wave\u2019s annealers, IonQ\u2019s and Quantinuum\u2019s trapped-ion processors, Rigetti\u2019s superconducting processors, and more \u2013 all through Amazon\u2019s cloud with pay-as-you-go pricing. This mirrors AWS\u2019s strategy in classical computing: be the platform that offers infrastructure (here, quantum infrastructure as a service). Amazon\u2019s approach is thus **hardware-agnostic and customer-focused** \u2013 making it easier for businesses to experiment with quantum tech without dealing with each vendor separately. Beyond Braket, Amazon has invested in in-house R&D via the **AWS Center for Quantum Computing** at Caltech. This research center (opened around 2021) is working on Amazon\u2019s own quantum hardware, rumored to be focused on superconducting qubits and quantum error correction. Amazon is also active in **quantum networking**, having launched the AWS Center for Quantum Networking in 2022 to develop quantum communication technologies\u301049\u2020L3-L7\u3011. In terms of partnerships, Amazon has teamed with companies like NVIDIA to integrate classical computing tools (for example, using Amazon Braket with NVIDIA\u2019s quantum simulation frameworks)\u301050\u2020L11-L19\u3011\u301050\u2020L21-L24\u3011. It\u2019s also notable that Amazon\u2019s CEO in 2022, Andy Jassy, highlighted quantum computing as a long-term bet, similar to how AWS itself was a long-term bet years ago. While Amazon doesn\u2019t yet offer its own quantum hardware publicly, the combination of Braket\u2019s multi-vendor access and its internal R&D (plus Amazon\u2019s vast resources) positions it as a key quantum player. Amazon\u2019s strategy can be summarized as: **enable the quantum ecosystem now (to build demand and expertise) and develop proprietary quantum tech for the future**.\n\n- **D-Wave**: Unlike the other major companies, D-Wave (a Canadian company) has focused on a different model of quantum computing known as **quantum annealing**. D-Wave has been selling quantum annealers commercially for years, targeting specific optimization problems. In 2020, D-Wave launched its 5th-generation machine, **Advantage**, with **over 5,000 qubits** (by far the highest qubit count in the industry)\u301064\u2020L64-L72\u3011. These qubits are not gate-model qubits but rather used in a specialized annealing process to solve things like the Ising model or binary optimization problems. The Advantage system also has 15-way connectivity between qubits (each qubit connected to 15 others), vastly improved from earlier 6-way connected 2000-qubit systems\u301064\u2020L64-L72\u3011. D-Wave\u2019s strategy has been to target real-world optimization use cases in logistics, scheduling, machine learning, etc., **right now**, even if its machines lack the generality of gate-based quantum computers. For example, D-Wave reports that **over 250 applications** have been developed on its systems\u301062\u2020L29-L36\u3011. Companies like Volkswagen (for traffic flow and factory optimization), Save-On-Foods (a grocery chain optimizing store operations), and pharmaceutical startups (for protein folding) have tested or used D-Wave\u2019s systems in pilot projects\u301064\u2020L85-L93\u3011. While there is debate in academia about whether D-Wave\u2019s annealers provide a quantum speedup over classical algorithms, they have undeniably been useful as an **experimental platform for quantum-inspired solutions**. D-Wave also offers a cloud service called Leap, and its machines are available through AWS Braket as well. Recently, D-Wave has started expanding into the gate-model arena \u2013 in 2021 it announced plans for a gate-based quantum computer, signaling an intent to compete more directly with the likes of IBM and Google in the long term. As of 2024, D-Wave\u2019s gate-model prototype is still in development. Financially, D-Wave went public via SPAC in 2022, raising funds to continue its dual approach (annealing for near-term revenue, gate model for future growth). In summary, D-Wave has carved out a niche by delivering *practical quantum hardware to industry early*: its annealers are being used in real business problems (though often alongside classical methods) and they have helped companies get \u201cquantum-ready.\u201d Its continued innovation in annealing and new venture into universal quantum computing make it an important player to watch.  \n\n- **Quantum Startups and Innovation**: The quantum computing landscape has seen an explosion of startups in the last five years, each aiming at different pieces of the puzzle. A few notable ones include:  \n  - **IonQ** \u2013 Founded in 2015, IonQ specializes in trapped-ion quantum computers. It has built systems with 11, 23, and 32 high-quality qubits, achieving industry-leading gate fidelities. IonQ\u2019s 11-qubit system was among the first available via cloud (through AWS Braket and Azure Quantum), and the company claims its newest systems have a quantum volume in the millions, indicating very low error rates\u301070\u2020L18-L26\u3011. IonQ went public in 2021, marking the first pure-play quantum hardware IPO, and has announced ambitious plans to network ion trap modules into larger \u201cquantum computing cells.\u201d  \n  - **Rigetti Computing** \u2013 A California-based startup building superconducting qubit processors. Rigetti has produced chips from 8 qubits up to 80 qubits and offers a Quantum Cloud Service that allows hybrid quantum-classical computing. It has also integrated its systems into AWS and other platforms. Rigetti went public in 2022. However, it faces stiff competition from the bigger superconducting efforts of IBM and Google, and has undergone some restructuring in 2023. Rigetti\u2019s focus has been on developing multi-chip scaling (breaking a quantum processor into smaller tiles and connecting them) and improving coherence through better fab technology.  \n  - **Quantinuum** \u2013 Formed by the 2021 merger of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing. Honeywell had built high-fidelity trapped-ion machines (achieving record Quantum Volume 1024 on a 12-qubit device)\u301057\u2020L161-L169\u3011, while Cambridge QC focused on quantum software and algorithms (especially in chemistry). Together as Quantinuum, they offer the System Model H1 ion-trap machines via cloud and have a full-stack approach (hardware + software). They have demonstrated quantum error correction and released a quantum cybersecurity product (a quantum random number generator). Quantinuum is considered a leader in quantum performance metrics due to Honeywell\u2019s excellent qubit quality.  \n  - **Xanadu** \u2013 A Canadian startup focusing on photonic quantum computing. Xanadu developed the **Pennylane** software for quantum machine learning and in 2022 demonstrated the **Borealis** photonic processor achieving quantum advantage in boson sampling\u301067\u2020L88-L96\u3011. They are also working on photonic implementations of continuous-variable quantum computing and have a long-term goal of a fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer using silicon photonic chips and squeezers.  \n  - **PsiQuantum** \u2013 A Silicon Valley startup (with roots at Stanford/Cambridge) that is pursuing photonic quantum computing on a potentially revolutionary scale. PsiQuantum has raised enormous funding (over $700M) and claims to be building a **1-million qubit** photonic quantum computer with error correction, in partnership with GlobalFoundries for manufacturing. Their approach involves building thousands of photonic chips that will work together in a massive quantum architecture. While they have not yet publicly demonstrated a large-scale device, PsiQuantum\u2019s aggressive roadmap (they once hinted at a milestone by mid-2020s) has pushed the industry\u2019s expectations of scalability\u301011\u2020L491-L499\u3011.  \n  - **Others** \u2013 There are many other notable startups: **QCI** and **Quantum Brilliance** (exploring room-temperature devices, including diamond NV-center and silicon spin approaches), **Pasqal** and **QuEra** (neutral atom computing, both having built 100+ atom quantum simulators), **Zapata Computing** and **QC Ware** (quantum software startups providing algorithm design and consulting for enterprises), **Classiq** (quantum software stack automation), **ColdQuanta/Infleqtion** (cold-atom technology), **Atom Computing** (optically trapped atoms/spins, which announced a 1,000+ qubit Rydberg array in 2023), **Alice&Bob** (developing \u201ccat qubits\u201d in superconducting circuits for inherent error bias), and many more. This startup ecosystem is backed by growing venture capital and government funding worldwide. Notably, several quantum companies have gone public via SPACs (IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave) indicating investor appetite, though their valuations have fluctuated with the challenging path to revenue.  \n\nAcross the board, **investments and partnerships** have accelerated. Tech giants partner with startups (e.g., IBM with startups in its network, AWS with nearly every hardware provider via Braket) and with academia (public-private research centers in the US, EU, and Asia). Governments have also injected funding \u2013 such as the U.S. National Quantum Initiative (2018) and Europe\u2019s Quantum Flagship \u2013 which in turn boosts commercial efforts. In summary, the commercial quantum computing landscape from 2019 to 2024 is characterized by **rapid expansion and collaboration**. Established players like IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon provide the infrastructure and major breakthroughs, while nimble startups innovate on specialized technologies. This ecosystem has already yielded accessible quantum computing services (through the cloud) and is on the cusp of bigger milestones as companies race to achieve quantum advantage for useful applications.\n\n## Industry Adoption and Emerging Use Cases  \nQuantum computing\u2019s practical impact is still nascent, but various industries have begun **exploring and adopting quantum solutions** in pilot projects and research collaborations. In the past five years, sectors from finance to pharmaceuticals have invested in quantum computing initiatives, seeking to understand its potential for competitive advantage. Below we highlight adoption in key industries and example use cases:\n\n- **Financial Services**: The finance industry, with its complex calculations and optimizations, was one of the earliest adopters of quantum computing experimentation. Several banks have formed dedicated quantum research teams. For example, **HSBC and JPMorgan Chase both set up in-house quantum computing groups** to develop use cases in trading, risk management, and security\u301016\u2020L1-L9\u3011. In 2023, HSBC announced it had pioneered a quantum-based solution to secure its AI-driven foreign exchange trading platform\u301016\u2020L7-L9\u3011. This likely refers to using quantum-resistant encryption or quantum random number generation to protect trading algorithms. JPMorgan, meanwhile, has been very active: it collaborated with startup QC Ware to develop a *quantum-powered \u201cdeep hedging\u201d algorithm* for options risk management \u2013 an advanced quantum optimization approach for trading strategies\u301016\u2020L7-L9\u3011. JPMorgan also led a successful test of quantum key distribution for secure communications between its data centers (as noted earlier)\u301069\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Beyond these leaders, other financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, Barclays, and UBS have published research on quantum algorithms for portfolio optimization, option pricing, and fraud detection. Use cases in finance being explored include: **portfolio optimization** (finding the best asset mix under constraints \u2013 a complex optimization problem that quantum algorithms like QAOA may help with), **derivative pricing** (quantum algorithms for Monte Carlo simulation can potentially speed up valuation of complex derivatives\u30108\u2020L762-L770\u3011), **risk analytics** (such as value-at-risk calculations that involve heavy computation), and **cryptography** (ensuring encryption and cybersecurity are quantum-safe). While no bank is running quantum computers in daily operations yet, the **industry is quantum-readying itself**: conducting proofs-of-concept on current quantum hardware, training staff in quantum techniques, and forming partnerships (for instance, JPMorgan, Goldman, and others are part of IBM\u2019s Quantum Network and have partnerships with providers like D-Wave and Google). The expectation in finance is that even a modest quantum advantage in optimization or simulation could translate into significant monetary gains or risk reduction, so the sector is watching quantum developments closely.\n\n- **Pharmaceuticals and Drug Discovery**: Quantum computing holds great promise for the life sciences, especially in **molecular modeling, drug discovery, and materials for healthcare**. Over the last few years, major pharma companies have started investing in quantum R&D. A notable example is **Boehringer Ingelheim\u2019s partnership with Google Quantum AI**, announced in early 2021, to apply quantum computing to drug design and molecular dynamics simulations\u301071\u2020L11-L19\u3011. This three-year collaboration was Google QAI\u2019s first project in the pharma industry and centers on exploring how quantum algorithms (like variational chemistry algorithms) could simulate complex biomolecular systems (for instance, protein-folding or enzyme reactions) more efficiently than classical methods. Another example: **Roche** teamed up with Cambridge Quantum (now part of Quantinuum) around 2020 to develop quantum algorithms for early-stage drug discovery, such as simulating how drug candidates bind to targets\u301071\u2020L25-L33\u3011. On the startup side, companies like **Menten AI** and **ProteinQure** are using D-Wave\u2019s annealers and other quantum-inspired methods for protein design, searching for protein structures with certain properties using quantum optimization. In 2023, a collaboration between French startup Qubit Pharmaceuticals and quantum hardware company Pasqal demonstrated how a neutral-atom quantum processor could help predict the behavior of water molecules in a drug target\u2019s binding pocket \u2013 a classically challenging aspect of drug design\u301026\u2020L117-L125\u3011\u301026\u2020L127-L135\u3011. This showed the potential for quantum computers to improve the accuracy of **molecular simulations**, such as how a drug molecule and a protein interact with surrounding water molecules. While these are still research-stage efforts, the hope is that quantum computers will eventually be able to simulate larger molecules or reaction mechanisms exactly, something classical computers struggle with due to exponential complexity. In practice, the industry is initially using quantum computing to supplement classical simulations: e.g., using small quantum computations within a hybrid workflow to refine parts of a molecular model. Pharma companies like Merck and Johnson & Johnson have also invested in quantum software startups (Merck partnered with HQS Quantum Simulations back in 2019 to work on quantum chemistry software\u301024\u2020L195-L204\u3011\u301024\u2020L205-L213\u3011). **Use cases in pharma** on the radar include: finding new drug molecules by searching chemical space more efficiently, optimizing molecular properties (potency, toxicity) via quantum simulation, and even optimizing clinical trial logistics with quantum algorithms. Though a new drug *discovered entirely by a quantum computer* is likely years away, the pharmaceutical industry sees quantum computing as a potential accelerator for the lengthy R&D process, and they are laying the groundwork now.\n\n- **Logistics, Transportation, and Supply Chain**: Many problems in logistics and supply chain management are essentially optimization problems (route planning, scheduling, resource allocation) which become computationally hard at large scale. Quantum computing \u2013 especially quantum annealing and heuristic algorithms \u2013 has attracted interest here. For example, **Volkswagen** was one of the first automotive companies to experiment with quantum computing: in 2019 it used D-Wave\u2019s machine to optimize taxi ride routes in Beijing to reduce traffic congestion, and later to optimize the paint shop scheduling in one of its factories\u301064\u2020L85-L93\u3011. The quantum approach aimed to minimize color switches on the paint line, which can save time and cost. Similarly, **DHL** and **FedEx** have both explored quantum computing for route optimization and fleet scheduling to improve logistics efficiency (these were done with quantum-inspired algorithms on classical hardware as well as small quantum trials). In retail logistics, Canada\u2019s **Save-On-Foods** used D-Wave\u2019s quantum cloud to optimize the assignment of tasks to employees and vehicles for grocery distribution, reportedly finding more efficient schedules\u301064\u2020L85-L93\u3011. Another recent example is in the chemicals sector: **BASF** partnered with startup Kipu Quantum in 2024 to apply a novel quantum optimization algorithm to its internal logistics \u2013 specifically, optimizing robot scheduling in a lab and solving a traveling salesman route problem for deliveries\u301028\u2020L117-L125\u3011\u301028\u2020L119-L127\u3011. The quantum algorithm (a digitized counter-diabatic optimization method) outperformed certain classical heuristics and showed highly competitive results, although BASF noted it\u2019s still *\u201ca long way to go\u201d* for a clear business benefit\u301028\u2020L125-L133\u3011. These case studies illustrate the direction: companies are testing whether current quantum solvers can at least match classical solutions for difficult instances, as a precursor to potential future advantage. **Supply chain optimization** (e.g., optimizing inventory distributions or shipping routes) is another area being looked at by firms like UPS and BMW. BMW, in fact, ran a public quantum computing challenge in 2022 to crowdsource solutions for optimizing sensor placements in automotive design and for improving vehicle routing \u2013 demonstrating automotive sector interest in quantum methods. **Airbus** has a quantum program investigating aircraft loading optimization and flight route optimization with quantum algorithms. In summary, industries reliant on complex logistics have begun integrating quantum computing *in pilot projects*, often using today\u2019s quantum annealers or simulators to solve parts of problems or quantum-inspired algorithms. While classical operations research methods are very advanced, the combinatorial nature of these problems means even small improvements can save millions, so companies are keen to exploit any future quantum advantage.\n\n- **Materials Science and Chemistry**: Quantum computers are naturally suited to simulating quantum systems, which is highly relevant in materials science, chemistry, and related fields (like battery technology, catalysts, superconductors, etc.). There have been important early demonstrations here: In 2020, Google used a quantum processor to simulate the **behavior of a chemical compound\u2019s electrons** (specifically, a quantum simulation of a hydrogen chain in a Hartree-Fock approximation) beyond what could be done with brute-force classical simulation\u301045\u2020L143-L151\u3011. In 2021, a team used a D-Wave annealer to simulate a quantum magnetic material (the Ising model representing a magnet) and obtained results **comparable to real-world experiments**\u301030\u2020L112-L120\u3011\u301030\u2020L122-L130\u3011. This was a significant validation that even a noisy quantum annealer could capture the physics of a complex material (in this case, understanding magnetic phase transitions) correctly\u301030\u2020L122-L130\u3011. Chemical companies like **Dow, BASF, and Mitsubishi Chemical** have partnered with quantum computing firms to explore materials-related use cases. For example, Mitsubishi Chemical used a quantum-inspired algorithm to analyze chemical reaction networks, and Dow has worked with 1QBit (a quantum software company) to test quantum methods for material property prediction. In 2022, BMW and Mercedes participated in quantum chemistry studies to design better batteries (modeling lithium compounds) using IBM\u2019s quantum computers. **Use cases in materials science** likely to see quantum advantage include: calculating ground states and reaction rates for complex molecules or materials (which could lead to discovery of new pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, or superconductors), optimizing formulations (e.g., finding a chemical mixture with certain properties), and studying high-temperature superconductivity or other quantum phenomena in materials that classical computers can\u2019t easily handle. These applications often involve solving quantum-mechanical equations that blow up in complexity for large systems \u2013 something quantum computers should eventually excel at. Right now, material and chemical simulations on quantum hardware are limited to small molecules (a few atoms, or simplified models), but as qubit counts and coherence grow, so will the size of molecules we can exactly simulate. The **industry adoption here is through R&D partnerships**: nearly every major chemical and materials company is connected to some quantum pilot project, ensuring they can leverage breakthroughs as soon as they occur. \n\n- **Other Industries**: Virtually every tech-focused industry is monitoring quantum computing for potential disruption. In **energy**, companies like ExxonMobil and Total are looking at quantum algorithms for optimizing energy grids, improving seismic imaging for oil exploration, and designing better materials for energy storage. In **aerospace and defense**, Lockheed Martin (an early investor in D-Wave) and Airbus are testing quantum computing for complex systems optimization, satellite routing, and even cryptography for secure communications. The **machine learning sector** is exploring quantum algorithms for big data and AI; for example, anomaly detection in large datasets or quantum-enhanced natural language processing are areas of research, though still very academic. **Government agencies** (such as national labs) are driving quantum applications in fields like climate modeling (quantum algorithms for fluid dynamics or weather pattern analysis) and fundamental science (using quantum computers to simulate quantum field theories in physics, for instance). While these are not yet \u201cindustrial\u201d usage, they represent adoption by the scientific community to tackle problems beyond classical supercomputing.  \n\nIn general, we see a pattern of **co-development between quantum tech providers and industry end-users**: many large companies in various sectors have entered partnerships with quantum startups or quantum hardware companies to jointly develop algorithms for the company\u2019s specific use case. This is accelerating the readiness of quantum solutions. For now, these are mostly exploratory or proof-of-concept efforts \u2013 no industry has replaced classical computing with quantum computing in a production environment. However, the breadth of participation (finance, pharma, logistics, energy, etc.) shows a strong interest and a **first-mover advantage mindset**: industries want to be prepared to capitalize on quantum computing as soon as it becomes capable enough to deliver an advantage. The result is a virtuous cycle: industry problems guide academic and commercial research toward useful quantum algorithms, and breakthroughs in quantum computing feed back into more potential applications.\n\n## Key Challenges and Limitations  \nDespite the remarkable progress, **quantum computing still faces significant barriers** to widespread adoption. Current systems are limited in capability, and overcoming these limits is an active area of research. The key challenges include:\n\n- **Decoherence and Noise**: Quantum bits are extremely sensitive to their environment. Minor disturbances \u2013 thermal fluctuations, electromagnetic interference, atomic vibration \u2013 can cause qubits to lose their quantum state (a process known as decoherence) and introduce random errors. Superconducting qubits, for example, can maintain coherence only for microseconds to milliseconds in carefully shielded, ultra-cold conditions\u30101\u2020L85-L93\u3011. Trapped ions have longer coherence but can still decohere from electric field noise or imperfect vacuum. Decoherence and noise place a fundamental limit on how long a quantum computation can run and how many operations can be executed reliably. Although materials and engineering improvements have extended coherence times, noise remains the biggest enemy of quantum computation. **Keeping qubits stable** for the duration of a complex algorithm (which may require thousands or millions of quantum gate operations) is an unsolved challenge without error correction. In practice, today\u2019s quantum computers can only perform relatively short algorithms before noise overwhelms the results\u30101\u2020L87-L95\u3011. Reducing environmental noise (through better shielding, cooling, and isolation) and increasing intrinsic qubit coherence (through design improvements like noise-resistant qubit geometries or error-cancelling techniques) are ongoing efforts. Decoherence is the reason we need many physical qubits to make a single logical qubit that can act reliably.\n\n- **High Error Rates and Fidelity Issues**: Along with decoherence, the accuracy of quantum gate operations is a concern. A \u201ctwo-qubit gate\u201d (which creates entanglement) typically has an error rate on the order of 0.1% to 1% in many systems \u2013 sounds low, but when you need thousands of such operations, these errors compound. Even single-qubit rotations have small errors. These error rates are **orders of magnitude too high** for fault-tolerant computing, which generally requires error rates below ~0.0001% (1e-6 to 1e-7 per operation) depending on the error correction scheme. While some platforms have achieved 99.9% fidelity (superconducting, ion traps) for certain gates\u301039\u2020L115-L123\u3011, maintaining that across many qubits and throughout a lengthy computation is tough. Errors also come from qubit **crosstalk** (operations on one qubit inadvertently affecting another) and imperfect control pulses. As a result, scaling up qubit count often sees average fidelities drop. Experts note that **qubit fidelity must improve by several orders of magnitude** beyond even the best current systems (like Honeywell\u2019s trapped ions) to run error-corrected large algorithms\u301011\u2020L478-L485\u3011. This is a significant technological challenge. Each increment in fidelity often requires painstaking engineering \u2013 for instance, using better microwave control hardware, reducing impurities in materials, or employing dynamical decoupling sequences. Until error rates are tamed, quantum computers will produce inherently noisy outputs that limit their usefulness. Error mitigation techniques can partly address this, but the true solution is implementing **quantum error correction**, which brings us to the next challenge.\n\n- **Error Correction Overhead**: Quantum error correction (QEC) is theoretically the answer to decoherence and gate errors \u2013 it uses redundancy to store quantum information across many physical qubits in a way that can detect and fix errors. The challenge is that QEC itself is resource-intensive: a single *logical qubit* (error-corrected qubit) might require dozens or even thousands of physical qubits, depending on error rates and the code used. For example, a popular scheme is the surface code, which might need ~50 to 100 physical qubits per logical qubit if physical error rates are around 0.1% (and even more if errors are higher). This **huge overhead** means that a fully fault-tolerant universal quantum computer with, say, 100 logical qubits could need tens of thousands of physical qubits. Today\u2019s devices are nowhere near that scale. Moreover, the error correction circuits themselves are complex and introduce additional opportunities for error if not done properly. Only very recently have experiments (like Google\u2019s in 2023) even **approached the \u201cbreakeven\u201d point**, where error-correcting a logical qubit improved its reliability vs a single physical qubit\u301031\u2020L161-L169\u3011. Achieving *sustained* and *scalable* error correction \u2013 and doing so without an impractical number of qubits \u2013 remains a major hurdle. Some approaches like topological qubits aim to reduce the overhead by making qubits inherently less prone to errors, while others explore more efficient codes or biasing error types. Until error correction is fully realized, quantum computers will remain \u201cnoisy\u201d and limited in the size of problems they can solve. QEC is on the horizon now, but the field must demonstrate the ability to run error-correcting codes on large arrays of qubits and achieve logical error rates that beat the best classical methods. This is likely a gradual process that will play out over the next decade. In the meantime, **error mitigation** (software methods to alleviate errors without full correction) is used, but it\u2019s not a panacea and often requires multiple runs and assumptions about noise.\n\n- **Scalability and Qubit Connectivity**: Beyond issues of noise, just physically scaling up the number of qubits and maintaining controllability is challenging. Each qubit added to the system requires additional control lines, calibration, and introduces potential cross-coupling. Superconducting qubits, for instance, are laid out on a chip with wiring for microwave control and readout \u2013 going from 50 qubits to 1000 qubits is not as simple as making a chip 20x larger, due to routing microwave lines and ensuring the fridge can cool it, etc. Companies are exploring new packaging (3D integration) and modular architectures for this reason\u301035\u2020L105-L113\u3011. Ion traps can chain maybe 50-100 ions in one trap, but beyond that the chain becomes unstable; hence ideas to shuttle ions between traps or network traps with photonics. **Connectivity** is another factor: in some systems each qubit only directly talks to its nearest neighbors, which can create bottlenecks for certain algorithms that need distant qubits to interact (you then have to swap states around, adding more gates and errors). Technologies like ion traps have an advantage of global interactions, whereas superconductors often have local interactions. Designing architectures that are both **highly connected and scalable** is a puzzle. Some proposals involve modular quantum computing (like linking small superconducting chips with microwave-to-optical transducers) or photonic interconnects\u301065\u2020L51-L59\u3011\u301065\u2020L58-L66\u3011, as demonstrated in Oxford\u2019s experiment. Those add complexity in terms of networking and classical synchronization. Another aspect is **control electronics**: currently, a lot of classical electronics (AWGs, FPGAs, etc.) are required to drive qubits. Scaling to thousands of qubits might require integrating some control electronics closer to the qubits (perhaps even inside the cryostat), which itself is a challenge (like developing cryo-CMOS or optical controls). Essentially, making the leap from \u201cdozens of qubits\u201d to \u201cthousands or millions\u201d will require innovations not just in qubits but in the entire wiring, control, and architecture of quantum machines. Approaches like 3D chip stacking, photonic coupling, and more efficient control signal generation are all being researched. Until solved, **scaling remains one of the biggest practical barriers**: a quantum computer needs a large number of qubits to solve useful problems, but we can\u2019t currently build that many qubits without compromising performance or manageability.\n\n- **Cost and Infrastructure**: Quantum computers are expensive and complex devices to build and operate. They often require specialized infrastructure that is not widely available outside research labs. For example, superconducting qubit systems need dilution refrigerators that cool the processors to ~10 millikelvin. These fridges are costly (millions of dollars each) and power-hungry (even though the chip itself doesn\u2019t consume much power, the fridge and support equipment do). Google\u2019s 53-qubit Sycamore, for instance, consumed a few kilowatt-hours of energy in just a 200-second experiment (mostly due to cooling overhead)\u301011\u2020L450-L458\u3011. In comparison, classical supercomputers consume megawatt-hours, but they also do far more work continuously \u2013 the point is, quantum systems currently aren\u2019t energy-efficient for practical tasks. Ion trap systems require ultra-high vacuum chambers, lasers for cooling and gates, and complex laser stabilization setups. These take up large optical tables and need regular maintenance by experts. **Photonics** might alleviate cryogenic needs (some photonic schemes work at room temp), but they require precise alignments of optical components and sources of single photons, which is also non-trivial. All of this means that setting up a quantum computing facility is extremely resource-intensive. The cost is not just in the hardware but also in the **technical expertise and maintenance** \u2013 you need dilution fridge technicians, vacuum and laser specialists, microwave engineers, etc., to keep a quantum machine running. This stands in contrast to classical computing, where anyone can buy a server rack relatively easily. One hope is that **improvements in engineering** (like more turnkey dilution fridges, automated calibration software, etc.) and eventually **economies of scale** will bring costs down. There are startups (like Oxford Quantum Circuits and Equal1) working on integrating quantum processors into existing data center infrastructure \u2013 for example, OQC is installing a small quantum system in an Equinix data center in 2023 as a test\u301015\u2020L142-L150\u3011, and Equal1 is developing a quantum chip on silicon that can potentially run at higher temperatures and fit into standard server setups\u301015\u2020L145-L150\u3011. These efforts are geared toward reducing infrastructure barriers. Nonetheless, as of now, **quantum computing is largely confined to well-funded labs, tech giants, and national research facilities**, which limits who can physically access the hardware. Most users must rely on cloud access provided by those with the machines. Widespread adoption will require making the hardware more robust, automated, and cost-effective \u2013 which could be a decade-long process in itself, following a path similar to how early classical computers went from room-sized, bespoke machines to commodity hardware. \n\n- **Workforce and Expertise**: While not a technical limitation of the machines themselves, it\u2019s worth noting that the **talent pool for quantum computing is limited**. Designing, building, and programming quantum computers requires interdisciplinary expertise (quantum physics, engineering, computer science, error correction theory, etc.). There is a growing demand for quantum engineers and algorithm developers, but as an emerging field, skilled professionals are relatively few. This means organizations looking to adopt quantum computing face a challenge in hiring or training people who can actually implement solutions. Many companies have started partnerships with universities or training programs for this reason. The educational pipeline is catching up \u2013 more quantum computing courses, degrees, and certification programs are appearing \u2013 but talent shortage could slow down how quickly industry can adapt to quantum breakthroughs. Additionally, for consumers or enterprise IT staff, there\u2019s a steep learning curve to even understanding what quantum computing can do and how to integrate it. As quantum computing becomes more practical, **knowledge dissemination and workforce development** will need to accelerate to avoid that human factor becoming a bottleneck.  \n\nIn summary, **quantum computing in 2024 remains in the \u201chard problem\u201d phase**: qubits decohere quickly, operations are noisy, we can only build so many qubits, and keeping systems running is expensive and complex. Each of these limitations is actively being addressed by research. There have been encouraging signs \u2013 e.g., better coherence, preliminary error correction success, and prototype modular systems \u2013 but none of the challenges have been fully overcome yet. These barriers imply that, in the immediate future, quantum computers will still be limited in size and might require significant effort to use effectively. Overcoming these challenges is the key to unlocking the technology\u2019s full potential, and it\u2019s the focus of essentially all quantum hardware roadmaps going forward.\n\n## Commercial Viability and Mainstream Adoption Timeline  \nThe big question for businesses and the public is: **when will quantum computing be a practical, mainstream tool?** Based on the current state of technology and expert roadmaps, quantum computing is **on the cusp of useful breakthroughs**, but widespread commercial use is still some years away. We can consider the short-term versus long-term prospects:\n\n- **Short-Term (Next 3\u20135 Years)**: In the immediate future, quantum computing will likely remain in the realm of **specialized use and continued R&D** rather than general commercial deployment. We are currently in what\u2019s known as the **NISQ era** (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum), where devices have on the order of 50\u20131000 qubits that are not error-corrected\u301011\u2020L458-L466\u3011. During the next few years, these NISQ devices will become more accessible through cloud services (as is already the case with IBM, AWS Braket, Azure, etc.), and we may see a few narrow quantum advantages demonstrated for specific problems. For example, a quantum computer might start to outperform classical methods in a tightly defined domain like random sampling (already done) or perhaps certain optimization problems or quantum chemistry simulations at a useful scale. **Early commercial use** will likely be in the form of cloud-based quantum services where companies run parts of computational workloads on quantum processors as accelerators. Some startups and financial firms are already integrating quantum algorithms experimentally into their workflows \u2013 for instance, doing a quantum Monte Carlo step as part of a larger calculation \u2013 to see if even a noisy quantum processor can offer a speedup or better scaling. In the short term, though, most businesses will treat quantum computing as an exploratory field: a tool for gaining insights, prototyping algorithms, and learning, rather than something that provides a clear ROI yet. It\u2019s telling that BCG (Boston Consulting Group) expects the NISQ phase to last potentially **until the late 2020s** in which only certain use cases will start to show benefit\u301011\u2020L462-L470\u3011. During this phase, **hybrid quantum-classical computing** will be key \u2013 using classical computers for stability and quantum ones for specific challenging sub-problems. We will also likely see improvements in **quantum software integration** (better compilers, middleware) that make it easier to plug a quantum routine into a company\u2019s existing data infrastructure. Many companies are taking a cloud approach (no one is installing a quantum computer on-premises yet; they\u2019re leveraging IBM/Amazon/Microsoft\u2019s cloud access) \u2013 this will continue short-term, effectively \u201coutsourcing\u201d the complexity to quantum providers. On the consumer side, end-users won\u2019t directly interact with quantum computers in this timeframe. However, they might **indirectly** benefit from quantum computing if, say, their bank uses a quantum algorithm to optimize investments (potentially yielding better returns) or if new drugs get discovered a bit faster due to quantum-assisted research. Importantly, in the next 3-5 years, we anticipate **incremental milestones**: slightly larger qubit counts, a successful demonstration of a small error-corrected logical qubit (maybe achieving seconds of coherence), and some prototypes of modular quantum systems. These will be harbingers of viability but not yet the full realization. In essence, quantum computing by 2025 will be an emerging technology that innovative companies use to *gain a strategic edge in knowledge*, rather than a workhorse for everyday computing tasks.\n\n- **Long-Term (5\u201315 Years and Beyond)**: The long-term outlook is where quantum computing becomes truly transformative. Experts project that once **quantum error correction is mastered and machines reach a certain size (perhaps hundreds of logical qubits)**, we will enter a period of **\u201cbroad quantum advantage.\u201d** BCG analysis suggests this could be in the late 2020s to 2030s, depending on progress\u301011\u2020L470-L479\u3011. In this scenario, quantum computers can reliably solve important problems faster or better than classical computers. The **roadmaps of major players reflect this timeline**: Google\u2019s aim of an error-corrected useful quantum computer by 2029\u301060\u2020L13-L16\u3011, IBM\u2019s plan for thousand-plus qubit systems with some level of fault tolerance by around 2030, and startups like PsiQuantum eyeing the second half of the 2020s for potentially revolutionary hardware\u301011\u2020L493-L500\u3011. If these targets are met, by the **early-to-mid 2030s** we could see quantum computers being used in commercial settings for tasks like drug discovery (e.g., simulating a new compound accurately), complex optimization (e.g., global supply chain routing, ultra-efficient logistics), advanced machine learning (quantum-boosted AI models), and breaking certain cryptographic codes (which is why the transition to post-quantum encryption is urgent in that timeframe). The **long-term prospect** is that quantum computers become a standard part of the computing arsenal \u2013 much like GPUs or cloud servers today \u2013 and are used whenever a problem\u2019s complexity exceeds what classical computers can handle. They would likely be deployed through cloud due to their specialized nature and cost, but large corporations or government labs might own dedicated quantum machines for proprietary use. In the long term, we might also see **quantum computing moving closer to consumers in indirect ways**: for instance, cloud services or software that consumers use (like search engines, financial planning tools, medical analysis apps) could have quantum computing on the backend without the user even knowing, just as AI enhances many consumer apps invisibly today. Some optimistic experts foresee that in 20+ years, technology like quantum computing could even miniaturize (with room-temperature qubits or photonic chips) to the point of being in a server closet or even a laptop, but that is speculative and would require breakthroughs in physics and engineering far beyond the current state. For the foreseeable future (next 10-20 years), quantum computers will remain **large, specialized installations**.\n\n- **Mainstream Commercial and Consumer Adoption**: Reaching \u201cmainstream\u201d status means quantum computing is a routine part of business operations and possibly even consumer-facing products. This is likely *at least a decade away*. One key marker will be when quantum computing provides **cost-effective advantages**: i.e., when using a quantum service saves money or time compared to using more classical compute power. At that point, even risk-averse industries will start adopting it. Early mainstream adoption might occur in cloud computing platforms \u2013 for example, Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure might offer quantum acceleration as a standard feature for certain cloud computing tasks, so companies can offload parts of computations to quantum without deep expertise (much like GPU acceleration is offered now). When that happens, many businesses can tap quantum benefits simply by using cloud APIs, bringing it into the mainstream enterprise toolkit. We can imagine that by the 2030s, **quantum computing could be behind the scenes in many sectors**: pharmaceuticals routinely using quantum chemistry for drug pipelines, banks using quantum optimization for large portfolio management, manufacturers designing materials or optimizing factory processes with quantum help, and governments using quantum simulators for climate and physics research. \n\nFor **consumer adoption**, the average person is unlikely to interact with a quantum computer directly (there won\u2019t be \u201cquantum laptops\u201d in homes in the near future). Instead, consumer impact will be indirect: for example, **quantum-optimized routing** might mean your mapping app finds better traffic solutions, or **quantum-designed materials** might make your smartphone batteries last longer, or new medications discovered via quantum computing could improve health outcomes. Another consumer-relevant aspect is **encryption**: if large quantum computers arrive, they could break current encryption, which is why companies and governments are transitioning to quantum-resistant encryption now\u301068\u2020L577-L584\u3011 \u2013 a sort of precautionary adoption to be safe in the era of quantum computers. In terms of public awareness, quantum computing might remain a mostly behind-the-scenes technology, unlike, say, smartphones or personal computers which are directly handled by consumers. \n\n**Timelines** are of course educated guesses. It\u2019s worth noting that some in the field remain cautious \u2013 there could be unforeseen roadblocks that delay progress (a so-called \u201cquantum winter\u201d if hype isn\u2019t met with results\u301011\u2020L495-L502\u3011). Conversely, there could be unexpected breakthroughs \u2013 for instance, a new qubit technology or error-correction method that accelerates the timeline significantly\u301011\u2020L493-L500\u3011. Given current knowledge, a reasonable forecast is: **by around 2030, quantum computers may start solving certain problems that businesses care about (with small-scale advantage), and by 2035 and beyond, they could become a critical component in many industries\u2019 computational infrastructure**. Mainstream adoption will likely be gradual rather than a sudden switch \u2013 similar to how AI made a lot of quiet progress before it suddenly seemed ubiquitous. \n\nIn conclusion, **we are not \u201cquantum-ready\u201d for mainstream use yet, but we are steadily getting there**. Every year, qubit counts grow, errors shrink, and algorithms improve, bringing us closer to the tipping point where quantum computing delivers clear commercial value. Companies today are wise to **stay engaged with quantum developments**, through partnerships or internal teams, so they build expertise ahead of time. The short-term will see continued learning and niche successes, and the long-term holds the promise of quantum computing as a transformative general-purpose technology. Exactly when quantum computers will be as commonplace as classical computers is uncertain, but the trajectory of the last five years gives confidence that it\u2019s a question of \u201cwhen\u201d and not \u201cif.\u201d As one analysis put it, broad quantum advantage is likely within the next **5 to 20 years**, and the race is on to overcome the remaining hurdles and achieve that\u301011\u2020L470-L479\u3011\u301011\u2020L481-L488\u3011. The coming decade will thus be crucial in determining how fast quantum computing moves from the laboratory to the engine of innovation in the wider economy.\n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":1176,"end_ix":1190,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"IQM Quantum Computers Achieves Technological Milestones With 99.9% 2-Qubit Gate Fidelity And 1 Millisecond Coherence Time","url":"https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/07/15/iqm-quantum-computers-achieves-technological-milestones-with-99-9-2-qubit-gate-fidelity-and-1-millisecond-coherence-time/#:~:text=A%20record%20low%20error%20rate,qubits%20and%20executing%20quantum%20algorithms","text":"A record low error rate for two-qubit operations was achieved by demonstrating a CZ gate between two qubits with (99.91 +- 0.02) % fidelity, which was validated by interleaved randomised benchmarking.
