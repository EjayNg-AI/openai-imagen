Global Mathematical Questions\n\n| Topic | Status | Key open questions |\n|-------|--------|--------------------|\n| **Non\u2011linear stability of black\u2011hole spacetimes** | Full stability proved for Minkowski (Christodoulou\u2013Klainerman 1993) and for **slowly rotating Kerr** (Klainerman\u2013Szeftel\u2013Giorgi 2022\u201124).\u00a0The generic\u2011spin Kerr problem is still unsolved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 | *Extend stability to the entire Kerr family; prove stability in higher dimensions and in AdS/\u039b\u22600 backgrounds.* |\n| **Cosmic censorship (weak & strong)** | Still unproven. Model\u2011specific counter\u2011examples exist (e.g., \u201cnaked\u201d solutions in self\u2011gravitating scalar fields), but no decisive theorem or refutation in 3\u202f+\u202f1 dimensions. | *Clarify whether generic initial data avoid naked singularities; pin down interior dynamics (mass inflation, Cauchy\u2010horizon structure) of realistic rotating/charged black holes.* |\n| **Penrose & related geometric inequalities** | Riemannian form proved in special cases; new extensions appear almost yearly (e.g., isoperimetric variants and higher\u2011dimensional cohomogeneity\u2011one cases) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201 | *General spacetime Penrose inequality; sharp inequalities with multiple horizons, matter fields, \u039b\u22600.* |\n| **Positive/quasi\u2011local mass & angular momentum** | Positive mass theorem stable, but a consensus \u201cquasi\u2011local\u201d (finite\u2011region) definition usable in dynamics is elusive. | *Construct quasi\u2011local quantities that are both geometrically natural and numerically practical; prove corresponding balance laws.* |\n| **Well\u2011posedness of Einstein equations with matter** | Vacuum case well understood; many realistic fluids/plasmas remain only weakly controlled mathematically. | *Global existence and shock\u2011formation in relativistic MHD, viscous fluids, and kinetic descriptions (Vlasov\u2013Einstein).* |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Strong\u2011Field & Computational Relativity\n\n1. **High\u2011precision binary\u2011merger waveforms**  \n   *Goal*: produce sub\u2011percent\u2011accurate templates for eccentric, highly precessing, or extreme\u2011mass\u2011ratio systems needed by LIGO\u2013Virgo\u2013KAGRA, Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and **LISA**.  \n   *Open*:\u202fefficient GPU\u2011driven solvers, higher\u2011order adaptive mesh refinement, coupling MHD for mergers with matter.\n\n2. **Gravitational self\u2011force & second\u2011order perturbation theory**  \n   Essential for modelling EMRIs (small compact object inspiralling into SMBH) where perturbation + self\u2011force + post\u2011adiabatic corrections must reach \u0394\u03c6\u202f\u2248\u202f10\u207b\u00b3\u202frad accuracy.\n\n3. **Relativistic plasma & jet simulations (GRMHD)**  \n   Unresolved issues: magnetic reconnection near event horizons, jet collimation, pair production.  Event Horizon Telescope images constrain models but also expose theory/observational gaps.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Testing GR with Observations (but remaining within GR)\n\n* **Parameterized strong\u2011field tests** using GW polarizations, inspiral phasing, ringdown spectroscopy, lensing of photon\u2011rings, and pulsar timing push GR into previously untested regimes.  \n* **Equivalence\u2011principle & Lorentz\u2011invariance** tests with atomic clocks, VLBI and satellite missions (e.g., MICROSCOPE, ACES, future STE\u2011QUEST) pursue 10\u207b\u00b9\u2077\u201310\u207b\u00b2\u00b9 sensitivity.  \n* **Relativistic geodesy**: measuring geopotential differences via optical clock networks could refine the geopotential at cm\u2011level and test GR\u2019s red\u2011shift formula terrestrially.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Spacetime Structure in Higher Dimensions & \u039b\u22600\n\n* **Higher\u2011dimensional black objects**: richness of black strings, branes, rings; Gregory\u2013Laflamme instability and its end\u2011state.  \n* **AdS stability/instability**: weakly turbulent transfer to small scales vs. integrable islands; recent proof of global non\u2011linear stability of Kerr\u2013de\u202fSitter (\u039b\u202f>\u202f0) spacetimes \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 but AdS counterpart is still open.  \n* **Holographic dualities at the classical level** feed back into questions about boundary conditions, asymptotics, and quasi\u2011local charges.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Relativistic Cosmology (still GR, not \u039bCDM specifics)\n\n1. **Back\u2011reaction & averaging**  \n   Do inhomogeneities modify the large\u2011scale dynamics enough to mimic dark\u2011energy effects?  Rigorous averaging schemes and fully relativistic N\u2011body codes are active areas.\n\n2. **Singularity behaviour & BKL conjecture**  \n   Mixmaster\u2013type chaotic oscillations near spacelike singularities lack a complete proof; implications for the classical beginning of the Universe remain unsettled.\n\n3. **Relativistic structure formation**  \n   Incorporating relativistic corrections into precision cosmology (sub\u2011percent level for next\u2011generation surveys) requires post\u2011Friedmann and fully GR N\u2011body approaches.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Asymptotic Symmetries, Memory & Soft Theorems\n\nBMS symmetry in 4D has blossomed into a rich program linking:\n* **Gravitational memory effects** measurable by advanced GW detectors.  \n* **Classical soft theorems** for gravity, potentially constraining waveform tails and inspiral\u2011merger transitions.  \nPrecise formulation for generic (non\u2011asymptotically flat) spacetimes and inclusion of matter is not yet settled.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Relativistic Continuum Mechanics\n\n* **Shock formation in relativistic fluids and elastic media**; interplay with gravitational collapse.  \n* **Relativistic kinetic theory** (Einstein\u2013Vlasov) global existence for realistic particle distributions.  \n* **Tidal disruption and crust\u2011breaking in neutron stars** under fully General\u2011Relativistic elasticity remain poorly understood.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Foundational & Conceptual Issues Inside GR\n\n* **Initial boundary value formulations** with timelike boundaries (relevant for Cauchy\u2013characteristic matching and AdS) need a fully satisfactory, constraint\u2011preserving scheme.  \n* **Choice of observables**: constructing fully diffeomorphism\u2011invariant, gauge\u2011independent \u201cgravitational observables\u201d beyond asymptotic charges (e.g., relational observables, geometric invariants defined via observers).  \n* **Energy conditions**: exploring modified (averaged or quantum\u2011corrected) energy conditions and their consequences for singularity theorems within classical GR frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### Outlook\n\nGeneral Relativity at 110\u202f+\u202f years is *not* a closed theory.  Progress hinges on:\n\n* **Mathematical breakthroughs** (e.g., full Kerr stability, definitive cosmic\u2011censorship theorems).  \n* **Computational advances** enabling exascale, multi\u2011physics simulations.  \n* **High\u2011precision observations** (GW detectors, EHT\u2011style imaging, clock networks) that push the theory into corners never before tested.  \n\nCombined, these directions will either continue to confirm Einstein\u2019s equations\u2014or reveal precisely *where* new physics must enter."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":727,"end_idx":746,"safe_urls":["https://www.ljll.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ljll240405klainerman.s-0.6mo.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ljll.fr](https://www.ljll.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ljll240405klainerman.s-0.6mo.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF]
