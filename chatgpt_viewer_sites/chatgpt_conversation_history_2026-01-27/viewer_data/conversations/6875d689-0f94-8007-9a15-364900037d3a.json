The same goes for 1s. With fewer misleading cases, the receiver\u2019s average uncertainty after looking at the wire drops, so the information they gain rises.\n\n2. **Clearer separation in the receiver\u2019s experience.**  \n   Think of two jars: one represents \u201cI sent 0,\u201d the other \u201cI sent 1.\u201d  \n   Each jar contains black and white marbles in the proportions the receiver actually sees.  \n   *When \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) go up, each jar gets more of its \u201cown\u201d colour and less of the opposite.*  \n   The jars look more different, so it\u2019s easier to tell which jar a sampled marble came from \u2013 again, more information per symbol.\n\n3. **No trade-offs involved.**  \n   We\u2019re not gaining reliability for 0s at the expense of 1s (or vice-versa); *both* sides improve. That means every way you might choose to mix 0s and 1s benefits, so the *best* mix \u2013 \\(r^{*}\\) \u2013 certainly benefits too.\n\n---\n\n**4  What happens to the optimal mix \\(r^{*}\\)?**  \nBecause the improvements are symmetrical (both symbols become more reliable), the \u201csweet spot\u201d mix barely moves:  \n* If 0s and 1s were already about equally reliable, \\(r^{*}\\) stays near 50\u201350.  \n* If one symbol was still a little cleaner than the other, the receiver will lean a touch more on that cleaner symbol, so \\(r^{*}\\) nudges in that direction \u2013 but the change is small compared with the clear gain in capacity.\n\n---\n\n### One-sentence takeaway\n\n*When a noisy binary channel is already better than random guessing and both correct-delivery chances rise further, every transmitted symbol sheds more of the receiver\u2019s uncertainty, so the maximum achievable information per use \u2013 the channel capacity \\(f(r^{*})\\) \u2013 **must increase** (while the optimal input mix \\(r^{*}\\) shifts only slightly).*"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"95fe24b189be8352-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"812f82e3-21bc-490b-a51b-49b40ada3b79","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"812f82e3-21bc-490b-a51b-49b40ada3b79","children":["1bd753a5-bd01-4b25-acd1-ab1e06ddff70"]},"1bd753a5-bd01-4b25-acd1-ab1e06ddff70":{"id":"1bd753a5-bd01-4b25-acd1-ab1e06ddff70","message":{"id":"1bd753a5-bd01-4b25-acd1-ab1e06ddff70","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752635524.153,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Let's suppose this is a test question inviting a brief, qualitative response from the student.
