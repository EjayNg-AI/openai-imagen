General mathematical foundations of ML**\n- **Christopher M. Bishop \u2013 *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning***  \n  A classic that rigorously covers probabilistic models, SVMs, kernel methods, and the optimization theory underlying them.  \n- **Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman \u2013 *The Elements of Statistical Learning***  \n  Very strong on the statistical and optimization theory behind SVMs, boosting, and regularization.  \n- **Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong \u2013 *Mathematics for Machine Learning***  \n  Builds up the linear algebra, calculus, probability, and optimization needed, with derivations of backpropagation and SVMs from first principles.\n\n---\n\n**2. Deep learning and backpropagation calculus**\n- **Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville \u2013 *Deep Learning***  \n  Chapter 6 (Deep Feedforward Networks) and Chapter 8 (Optimization) provide a mathematically detailed treatment of backpropagation and gradient-based learning.  \n- **Magnus Ekman \u2013 *Learning Deep Learning***  \n  Puts emphasis on the tensor calculus and matrix derivatives in backpropagation, with worked derivations.  \n- **Michael Nielsen \u2013 *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*** (free online)  \n  Clear derivations of backpropagation with matrix calculus, though slightly less dense than Goodfellow et al.\n\n---\n\n**3. Optimization theory relevant to ML**\n- **Stephen Boyd, Lieven Vandenberghe \u2013 *Convex Optimization***  \n  Gold-standard reference for the mathematical theory behind SVMs, regularized regression, and boosting.  \n- **Dimitri Bertsekas \u2013 *Nonlinear Programming***  \n  Covers gradient methods, constrained optimization, and Lagrange multipliers in full mathematical depth.\n\n---\n\n**4. Gradient boosting and ensemble methods**\n- **Jerome Friedman \u2013 original gradient boosting papers** (esp. \u201cGreedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine\u201d)  \n  The mathematical derivations are concise but foundational.  \n- **Hastie\u2013Tibshirani\u2013Friedman (ESL)**, chapters on additive models and boosting, for theory and proofs.  \n- **Tong Zhang & Bin Yu \u2013 \u201cBoosting with Early Stopping: Convergence and Consistency\u201d** (Annals of Statistics) for a statistical-learning-theoretic view.\n\n---\n\n**5. Mathematical depth for kernel methods and SVMs**\n- **Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf, Alexander J. Smola \u2013 *Learning with Kernels***  \n  Rigorous mathematical treatment of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), convex duality, and SVM derivations.  \n- **John Shawe-Taylor, Nello Cristianini \u2013 *Kernel Methods for Pattern Analysis***  \n  Focuses on the functional-analytic backbone of SVMs and other kernel algorithms.\n\n---\n\nIf your aim is to work through all the mathematics in full \u2014 from multivariate calculus through convex optimization and functional analysis \u2014 a solid progression would be:\n\n1. *Mathematics for Machine Learning* (Deisenroth et al.) for prerequisites.  \n2. *Convex Optimization* (Boyd & Vandenberghe) for the optimization backbone.  \n3. *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* (Bishop) for probabilistic and statistical foundations.  \n4. *Learning with Kernels* (Sch\u00f6lkopf & Smola) for SVMs.  \n5. *Elements of Statistical Learning* (Hastie\u2013Tibshirani\u2013Friedman) for boosting and ensemble methods.  \n6. *Deep Learning* (Goodfellow et al.) for backpropagation calculus and modern extensions.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also prepare a **topic-to-chapter map** showing exactly which sections in these books cover backprop derivations, SVM theory, and gradient boosting mathematics in detail, so you can study them in a targeted way.
