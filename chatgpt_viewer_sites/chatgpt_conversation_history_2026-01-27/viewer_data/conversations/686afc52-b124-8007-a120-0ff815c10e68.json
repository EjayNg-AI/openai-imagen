Start with the richest possible PDF\n\n| Check | Why it matters |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **Is the PDF digitally-generated and tagged?** If yes, semantic information (headings, hyperlinks, footnotes, alt-text) is already embedded. |\n| **If it\u2019s a scan**, run OCR first (FineReader or Acrobat) and **export as a *tagged* PDF**. |\n| **Verify embedded fonts** (File \u25b6 Properties \u25b6 Fonts in Acrobat) so unusual glyphs survive round-trips. |\n\nIf you skip this \u201csource hygiene\u201d step, no converter\u2014commercial or open-source\u2014can guess the structure later.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Convert PDF \u2192 Word ( .docx )\n\n| Tool | Strengths for your constraints | Key settings |\n|------|--------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Adobe Acrobat Pro 2025** | \u2022 Best retention of hyperlinks, live footnotes and citation cross-refs<br>\u2022 Uses tagged PDF structure; no OCR if text layer already present | **File \u25b6 Export \u25b6 Microsoft Word**<br>\u2022 *Layout = Retain Flowing Text* (keeps logical paragraphs rather than boxed lines)<br>\u2022 Un-tick **Include Images** if you truly do not want them \u2014 everything else stays \ud83d\udec8 \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201 |\n| **ABBYY FineReader PDF 15/16** | Superior OCR for scanned pages; can export directly to DOCX or HTML with styles, links and headings (fonts preserved) \ue200cite\ue202turn13search8\ue201 | \u2022 Export \u25b6 **DOCX**<br>\u2022 *Document layout = Formatted text*<br>\u2022 Enable **Keep page numbers, headers/footers** if those matter |\n| **Open-source fallback** | For scripted pipelines or servers where licences are an issue | ```bash\n# 1. Convert PDF \u2192 HTML with layout + links\npdf2htmlEX --embed cfijo --dest-dir out input.pdf\n# 2. Convert HTML to DOCX\npandoc out/input.html -o output.docx\n```  \n`pdf2htmlEX` preserves fonts, links and special characters \ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue201 |\n\n> **Quality control tip:** open the DOCX and turn on *Track Changes*. If the converter mis-grouped lines, you can re-flow paragraphs quickly.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Convert DOCX \u2192 Markdown\n\nYou now have a structurally sound DOCX whose internal XML carries all links, character styles, bibliography fields, etc. Two paths:\n\n| Tool | Pros | Typical command |\n|------|------|-----------------|\n| **Pandoc \u2265 3.0** | \u2022 Mature, scriptable, cross-platform<br>\u2022 Built-in citeproc will render inline citations & full bibliography in Markdown<br>\u2022 Can discard or keep images via `--extract-media` | ```bash\npandoc input.docx \\\n  --to=gfm+smart \\\n  --citeproc \\\n  --wrap=none \\\n  --extract-media=media \\\n  -o output.md\n```  \nPandoc natively converts between docx, markdown, HTML, LaTeX, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view0\ue201 |\n| **Microsoft MarkItDown (Python)** | \u2022 One-liner for direct PDF \u2192 MD or DOCX \u2192 MD<br>\u2022 Emphasises preserving headings, lists, tables & links \u2013 tuned for LLM ingestion \ue200cite\ue202turn16view0\ue201 | ```bash\npip install 'markitdown[all]'\nmarkitdown input.docx -o output.md\n``` |\n\n**Pandoc vs MarkItDown**  \nPandoc gives more switches (templates, filters, custom cite styles). MarkItDown is faster for bulk ingestion when you do not need fine-grained control.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Verify special elements\n\n| Element | Where it can break | Mitigation |\n|---------|-------------------|------------|\n| **Math or chemical equations** | Acrobat and FineReader export them as embedded images by default. Pandoc will keep the `<image>` tag; MarkItDown attempts MathML \u2192 LaTeX but still struggles. | For academic papers, consider running latexml \u2192 HTML \u2192 Pandoc. |\n| **Footnotes vs endnotes** | Acrobat writes footnotes as in-text superscripts + end-section table. | Pandoc\u2019s `--wrap=none` + `--shift-heading-level-by` can tidy heading levels so notes don\u2019t become top-level sections. |\n| **RTL scripts / CJK characters** | Some free PDF \u2192 HTML converters drop bidi attributes. Acrobat/FineReader preserve them. | Always check sample paragraphs after conversion. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Putting it together in a reproducible script\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nin_pdf=\"$1\"\nbase=\"${in_pdf%.pdf}\"\n\n# 1. PDF \u279c DOCX (images optional)\nacrobat_export --layout flowing --no-images \"$in_pdf\" \"${base}.docx\"   # Adobe CLI, or use FineReader CLI\n\n# 2. DOCX \u279c Markdown, keep citations and hyperlinks\npandoc \"${base}.docx\" \\\n       --to=gfm+smart \\\n       --citeproc \\\n       --extract-media=media \\\n       --wrap=none \\\n       -o \"${base}.md\"\n```\n\n(Replace `acrobat_export` with FineReader\u2019s `['FineReader.exe', '/out', ...]` or the pdf2htmlEX \u2192 Pandoc fallback if you need a 100 % open-source chain.)\n\n---\n\n### 6. Summary of best-practice choices\n\n* **Highest fidelity, minimal effort:** Acrobat Pro \u25b6 DOCX \u2192 Pandoc \u25b6 Markdown.  \n  *Keeps hyperlinks, bookmarks, footnotes, custom fonts; handles complex tables better than any free stack.*  \n* **Best for scanned or multilingual PDFs:** FineReader OCR \u25b6 DOCX \u2192 Pandoc/MarkItDown.  \n* **Fully open-source / headless servers:** pdf2htmlEX \u2192 Pandoc for DOCX + MD.  \n* **One-liner direct to MD for LLM pipelines:** `markitdown input.pdf > out.md` (loses fine font choices but retains structure).\n\nFollow the QC step after each conversion\u2014PDFs are presentation-oriented, not semantic; **manual checks are unavoidable** for mission-critical documents."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201","start_idx":1409,"end_idx":1426,"safe_urls":["https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/file-format-options-pdf-export.html"],"refs":[],"alt":"([helpx.adobe.com](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/file-format-options-pdf-export.html))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"File format options for PDF export, Adobe Acrobat","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/file-format-options-pdf-export.html","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"helpx.adobe.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn13search8\ue201","start_idx":1582,"end_idx":1602,"safe_urls":["https://help.abbyy.com/en-us/finereaderengine/12/user_guide/specifications_exportformats?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([help.abbyy.com](https://help.abbyy.com/en-us/finereaderengine/12/user_guide/specifications_exportformats?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Export Formats - abbyy","url":"https://help.abbyy.com/en-us/finereaderengine/12/user_guide/specifications_exportformats?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Export Formats.
