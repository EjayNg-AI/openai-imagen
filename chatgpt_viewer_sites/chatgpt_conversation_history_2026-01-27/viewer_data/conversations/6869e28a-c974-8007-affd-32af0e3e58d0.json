While many businesses are still adapting to single AI agents, firms like Accenture are pioneering multiagent technologies, deploying them in areas such as marketing, finance, and logistics. Accenture currently operates over 50 systems with plans to exceed 100 by year-end, serving clients like BMW, Unilever, and ESPN. Its Trusted Agent Huddle enables agent interoperability with tech giants such as AWS, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nSupporting this shift, Salesforce and Google are developing a protocol called Agent-to-Agent (A2A) to standardize communication between AI agents. Startups like Keyway demonstrate multiagent systems in real estate, using coordinated agents to handle tasks ranging from pricing to tenant incentives. However, current systems still rely on structured workflows and human oversight, whereas future multiagent systems will dynamically reason and collaborate in real-time.\n\nTo prepare, companies should start by developing standalone agents and building the necessary data infrastructure.

Study attention math thoroughly; reproduce \u201cscaled-dot-product\u201d and \u201cmulti-head\u201d in NumPy.\n\n*Mini-projects*: fine-tune a DistilBERT sentiment model and deploy it as a Hugging Face Space.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3 \u2013 **Generative AI Specialisation** (Weeks 9-14)\n\n| Topic | Primary resource | Build & Ship |\n|-------|------------------|--------------|\n| Diffusion models (images & text) | fast.ai Part 2 *Foundations \u2192 Stable Diffusion* \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  + HF Diffusion-LM article \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201 | Train a LoRA on Stable Diffusion to generate custom artwork; analyse noise schedule curves |\n| Open-LLM fine-tuning | Philschmid\u2019s 2025 guide (QLoRA, Spectrum, Flash-Attention 2) \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201 | Fine-tune Llama-3 8B on a domain corpus with QLoRA; benchmark perplexity vs base |\n| Evaluation & safety | Adopt LM-Eval & Detoxify; learn prompt-based red-teaming | Produce eval report (accuracy, toxicity) for your model |\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4 \u2013 **Deep Reinforcement Learning & Decision-Making** (Weeks 15-18)\n\n* Follow **Stanford CS 224R** lectures & assignments to master policy gradients, actor-critic, DQN, PPO \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201.  \n* Build an RL agent that learns to play a simple gymnasium or Unity environment and visualise reward curves.\n\nThis prepares you for agents that **act**, not just generate.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5 \u2013 **AI Agents & Orchestration** (Weeks 19-24)\n\n1. Complete the **Hugging Face Agents Course** \u2013 it introduces the Thoughts \u2192 Actions \u2192 Observations loop and MCP-style schemas \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search1\ue201.  \n2. Survey leading **open-source frameworks** \u2013 LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, SuperAGI \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201 \u2013 compare how each handles memory, tool routing, and multi-agent graphs.  \n3. Read IBM\u2019s **2025 Guide to AI Agents** for architecture patterns & governance \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201.  \n4. Implement two agents:\n   * **RAG Research Assistant** \u2013 LLM + vector store + tool calls.\n   * **Task-Delegating Multi-agent** \u2013 planner/solver/evaluator trio that collaborates to finish a complex Python task.\n\nOptional: watch the n8n/agent workflow tutorial for low-code chaining ideas \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n*Industry context*: multi-agent systems are moving from demo to production in 2025, with standards like Agent-to-Agent (A2A) under development \ue200cite\ue202turn0news59\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6 \u2013 **Scaling, Optimisation & Deployment** (Weeks 25-30)\n\n* Study the **Ultra-Scale Playbook** to learn distributed data/ZeRO, tensor-parallel, FSDP \ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue201.  \n* Containerise everything with Docker + `torchrun`.  \n* Practise quantisation (bits-and-bytes 4-bit) and ONNX for edge inference.  \n* Automate CI/CD on a GitHub Actions + Terraform stack; monitor with Prometheus/Grafana.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 7 \u2013 **Capstone (Weeks 31-36)**\n\n> **Build, document and open-source** a production-grade system that combines:  \n> *Fine-tuned LLM* **+** *diffusion or audio generator* **+** *multi-agent orchestrator* to solve a real task (e.g., \u201cresearch, draft, illustrate and publish a textbook chapter\u201d).  \n\nInclude automated evaluation, a Streamlit or React front-end, and a Docker compose stack. Aim for *publish-able quality* rather than a hacky demo.\n\n---\n\n## Continuous Habits (start Day 1)\n\n* **Daily paper triage** \u2013 skim arXiv \u201ccs.LG\u201d & \u201ccs.CL\u201d; bookmark any paper that beats baselines you care about.  \n* **Weekly community engagement** \u2013 fast.ai & Hugging Face forums, LangChain Discord, Kaggle competitions.  \n* **Monthly reflection** \u2013 write a blogpost summarising what you built and *why it matters*; employers (and your future self) value articulated learning.\n\n---\n\n### Common Pitfalls & How to Dodge Them\n\n| Pitfall | Antidote |\n|---------|----------|\n| Chasing every new GitHub star | Stick to the roadmap; schedule \u201cplayground days\u201d so exploration doesn\u2019t derail core study |\n| Copy-pasting tutorials without understanding | Re-implement one key function (loss, attention, scheduler) from scratch each week |\n| GPU sticker shock | Use mixed-precision, gradient-checkpointing, or QLoRA before renting bigger hardware |\n| Over-engineering agents | Start with single-agent pipelines, add memory/tooling, *then* go multi-agent when the problem truly needs it |\n\n---\n\n## What \u201cMastery\u201d Looks Like\n\n* You can **read a new paper in the morning, prototype it by evening**, and benchmark against baselines.  \n* You have **three public repos**: one core DL model, one generative model, one multi-agent system, each with CI, README, and evaluation scripts.  \n* You comfortably discuss compute/latency/cost trade-offs with engineers *and* architectural motives with researchers.\n\nFollow this path, iterate aggressively, and treat every phase as an excuse to build something tangible. Certifications can help recruiters, but **shippable, open-source artefacts + clear write-ups** convince *everyone* that you really understand deep learning, generative AI, and agentic systems."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":1036,"end_idx":1055,"safe_urls":["https://course.fast.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Practical Deep Learning -

While many businesses are still adapting to single AI agents, firms like Accenture are pioneering multiagent technologies, deploying them in areas such as marketing, finance, and logistics. Accenture currently operates over 50 systems with plans to exceed 100 by year-end, serving clients like BMW, Unilever, and ESPN. Its Trusted Agent Huddle enables agent interoperability with tech giants such as AWS, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nSupporting this shift, Salesforce and Google are developing a protocol called Agent-to-Agent (A2A) to standardize communication between AI agents. Startups like Keyway demonstrate multiagent systems in real estate, using coordinated agents to handle tasks ranging from pricing to tenant incentives. However, current systems still rely on structured workflows and human oversight, whereas future multiagent systems will dynamically reason and collaborate in real-time.\n\nTo prepare, companies should start by developing standalone agents and building the necessary data infrastructure.
