Your local changes are already committed\n\nSituation:\n\n- Remote branch (say `origin/main`) is **1 commit ahead**.\n- Your local branch (say `main`) is **N commits ahead** (your work).\n- No overlapping edits \u21d2 no real conflicts expected.\n\n### Best practice: rebase your work on top of the remote\n\nThis keeps history linear and avoids an unnecessary merge commit.\n\nFrom your local repo:\n\n```bash\n# Make sure you're on the right branch\ngit status      # check you're on main (or the branch you're working on)\ngit fetch       # update your knowledge of origin/*\n```\n\nNow rebase your local branch on top of `origin/main`:\n\n```bash\ngit rebase origin/main\n```\n\nWhat this does:\n\n- Replays *your* commits as if they were made after the latest commit on `origin/main`.\n- If there are no overlapping changes, the rebase will complete with **no conflicts**.\n\nThen push:\n\n```bash\ngit push\n```\n\nBecause your branch was only **behind** the remote and you hadn\u2019t pushed your local commits before, no `--force` is needed.\n\n> Shortcut (if you haven\u2019t fetched yet):  \n> ```bash\n> git pull --rebase\n> ```  \n> This is equivalent to `git fetch` + `git rebase origin/<branch>`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Your changes are not yet committed (only in working tree)\n\nScenario:\n\n- You edited files but did **not** commit.\n- Remote is 1 commit ahead.\n\n### Option A (safe, clean): stash \u2192 pull \u2192 apply\n\n```bash\n# Save current uncommitted changes\ngit stash push -m \"WIP before pulling remote\"\n\n# Bring your branch up to date\ngit pull --rebase    # or just `git pull` if you don\u2019t care about linear history\n\n# Reapply your local changes\ngit stash pop\n```\n\nIf there are no overlapping edits with the new remote commit, `git stash pop` will apply cleanly.\n\nThen stage and commit:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Describe your change\"\ngit push\n```\n\n### Option B: commit first \u2192 rebase (my preferred style)\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Describe your change\"\ngit pull --rebase\ngit push\n```\n\nSame idea as case 1: your commit is replayed on top of the new remote commit.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What if you accidentally did a plain `git pull` already?\n\nIf you ran:\n\n```bash\ngit pull\n```\n\nwithout `--rebase`, Git will create a **merge commit**:\n\n- That\u2019s still \u201cclean\u201d in the sense of *correct*.\n- It just makes the history a bit noisier (you now have an extra merge commit).\n\nIf you care about a linear history and **haven\u2019t pushed** that merge commit yet, you can redo it with a rebase:\n\n```bash\n# Go back to the state before the merge (replace HEAD~1 if needed)\ngit reset --hard HEAD~1\n\n# Then do the cleaner rebase\ngit pull --rebase\ngit push\n```\n\nIf you **already pushed** the merge commit to a shared branch, it\u2019s usually better to **leave it** rather than rewriting history.\n\n---\n\n## Minimal \u201cclean\u201d recipe to remember\n\nIf I compress all of this into one mental rule for your scenario (1 commit ahead on remote, no conflicts):\n\n```bash\n# If your work is committed:\ngit pull --rebase\ngit push\n\n# If your work is uncommitted:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"...\"\ngit pull --rebase\ngit push\n```\n\nThat\u2019s the clean, linear-history way to resolve \u201cI forgot to pull before changing things, but nothing clashes.\u201d"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","request_id":"13f75be3-92aa-4334-9832-85716ba4f212","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"6843ca90-099f-446a-9cfd-b0dc89456565","turn_exchange_id":"39788f49-72c9-4882-9c59-0f00a3efaaa9"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"6843ca90-099f-446a-9cfd-b0dc89456565","children":[]}}}
