Basic setup: ZF + LM (no full AC)\n\nLet\u2019s denote the theory  \n\\[\n\\mathbf{ZF} + \\text{\u201cevery subset of }\\mathbb{R}\\text{ is Lebesgue measurable.\u201d}\n\\]\nYou can usually only get such a model by assuming a large cardinal (an inaccessible) and then constructing **Solovay\u2019s model**.\n\nIn **Solovay\u2019s model**, we have:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{ZF} + \\mathbf{DC} + \\text{\u201call sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable, have the Baire property, and the perfect set property.\u201d}\n\\]\n\nHere **DC** = Dependent Choice; enough for analysis, but strictly weaker than AC.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The continuum is *not* well-orderable\n\nBecause LM implies there are **no non-measurable Vitali sets**, \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) cannot be well-ordered.  \nThus there is **no bijection** between \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and any ordinal \\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\).\n\nHence:\n\\[\n2^{\\aleph_0} \\text{ exists as a cardinal } |\\mathcal P(\\omega)|,\n\\]\nbut this cardinal is **not** of the form \\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\).  \nWe can\u2019t even compare it with \\(\\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \u2026\\) in ZF + LM.\n\nIn particular,\n\\[\n2^{\\aleph_0}\\neq\\aleph_1,\\;\\aleph_2,\\text{ etc.}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Relative size information that still holds\n\nAlthough \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) is not comparable with the \\(\\aleph\\)-sequence, we can say:\n\n- \\(2^{\\aleph_0} > \\aleph_0\\) (obviously).\n- \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) is **Dedekind finite** in the sense that it has no countably infinite partition into disjoint non-empty sets without Choice.\n- Every set of reals is measurable, has BP and PSP, so any uncountable set of reals has a **perfect subset**.  \n  That implies all uncountable subsets of \u211d have **cardinality equal to \u211d** itself.\n  \n  In symbols:\n  \\[\n  \\forall A\\subseteq\\mathbb{R},\\quad A\\text{ uncountable} \\implies |A|=|\\mathbb{R}|.\n  \\]\n\nThus there are **no intermediate cardinalities** between \u2135\u2080 and |\u211d| among subsets of \u211d.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Power sets beyond \u211d\n\nEven though \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) (the power set of \u2115) is not comparable to the \\(\\aleph\\)-hierarchy, you can still consider higher power sets:\n\n- \\(2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}\\) (the power set of \u211d) **exists** in the set-theoretic sense.\n- Without Choice, it\u2019s unclear whether \\(2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}\\) > \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\); the usual proof of strictness uses Choice.\n- In Solovay\u2019s model one can still show \\(2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}\\) \u2260 \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) because measurable cardinals induce saturation properties, but you **cannot assign it an \\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\)** value either.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Relation to the Aleph sequence\n\n- The ordinal-indexed \\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\) sequence only measures the sizes of **well-orderable** sets.  \n- The reals, in an LM-universe, are **not well-orderable**, so \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) lies *outside* the \\(\\aleph\\)-hierarchy.\n- Hence the power-set hierarchy \u201cabove\u201d \u2135\u2080 splits into two branches: one for well-orderable cardinals (\\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\)) and one for the non-well-orderable cardinals beginning with |\u211d|.\n\nFormally:\n\\[\n\\aleph_0 < \\text{card}(\\mathbb{R}) < 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}} < \\cdots\n\\]\nbut no equality or comparison with \\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\) can be proven in ZF + LM.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Summary Table\n\n| Theory | Choice? | Every subset of \u211d measurable? | Well-ordering of \u211d? | \\(2^{\\aleph_0} = ?\\) | Comments |\n|--------|----------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|\n| ZFC | yes | no | yes | some \\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\) | Vitali sets exist |\n| ZF + LM | no | yes | no | not an \\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\) | all sets of reals have regularity |\n| ZF + AD | no | yes (even stronger) | no | not an \\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\) | same structure as Solovay model on reals |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Key takeaway\n\n> In any model of **ZF** where every subset of \u211d is Lebesgue measurable, the continuum is a **non-well-orderable** cardinal outside the \\(\\aleph\\)-sequence.  \n> There are only two sizes of subsets of \u211d: countable or the full continuum.  \n> Power-set cardinalities like \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\), \\(2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}\\), etc., exist but cannot be identified with any \\(\\aleph_\\alpha\\).  \n\nSo the cardinal-arithmetic landscape in such a universe is fundamentally **disconnected** from the usual hierarchy of well-orderable cardinals."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"model_slug":"gpt-5","request_id":"b4dfecb0-55eb-4d47-909e-a99e0af8b47d","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"ccab6b0a-6cca-4c90-bd16-ad7f1a1d385b","turn_exchange_id":"5a591a82-b016-46d6-acf2-408644cac347","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ccab6b0a-6cca-4c90-bd16-ad7f1a1d385b","children":[]}}}
