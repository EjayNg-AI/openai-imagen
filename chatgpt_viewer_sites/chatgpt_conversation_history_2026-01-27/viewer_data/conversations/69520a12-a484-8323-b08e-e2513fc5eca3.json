They are concerned about a more deadly pathogen - a so called \"Disease X\", which SIngapore's political leaders have mentioned before. This could well occur.\n\nOn the other hand, I sense great wariness on the part of the public in the Western world, at being subject to quarantines and restrictions of movement again. There is a loud and significant consensus that too much sacrifice had been demanded of them in COVID, and they will not be obey dictatiorial orders again.\n\nSingapore and other \"Eastern\" countries may be spared such a mindset (as of now), but surely we will see the level of disenhantment in Western societies and we will invariably be influenced -- to our detriment."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8c9b0ef9-06fe-4619-8707-33f1fc12aec0","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"9f8c7032-f7fc-4d98-8800-e26a1e1f80b7"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fa5e9bfe-d640-4e1d-b9f8-0509c91a7116","children":["1494a41b-7694-49fb-99ef-82636aeda290"]},"1494a41b-7694-49fb-99ef-82636aeda290":{"id":"1494a41b-7694-49fb-99ef-82636aeda290","message":{"id":"1494a41b-7694-49fb-99ef-82636aeda290","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766984507.713711,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"8c9b0ef9-06fe-4619-8707-33f1fc12aec0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"607f790b-b12e-41d8-b37b-d6eacb494530","turn_exchange_id":"9f8c7032-f7fc-4d98-8800-e26a1e1f80b7"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"607f790b-b12e-41d8-b37b-d6eacb494530","children":["83d13ff1-8cb9-4a83-8b86-2cfb83ce8528"]},"83d13ff1-8cb9-4a83-8b86-2cfb83ce8528":{"id":"83d13ff1-8cb9-4a83-8b86-2cfb83ce8528","message":{"id":"83d13ff1-8cb9-4a83-8b86-2cfb83ce8528","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766984508.010054,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"8c9b0ef9-06fe-4619-8707-33f1fc12aec0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"1494a41b-7694-49fb-99ef-82636aeda290","turn_exchange_id":"9f8c7032-f7fc-4d98-8800-e26a1e1f80b7"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1494a41b-7694-49fb-99ef-82636aeda290","children":["15ce0198-c4a3-4c71-9b8e-fdd2fc5ea4bd"]},"15ce0198-c4a3-4c71-9b8e-fdd2fc5ea4bd":{"id":"15ce0198-c4a3-4c71-9b8e-fdd2fc5ea4bd","message":{"id":"15ce0198-c4a3-4c71-9b8e-fdd2fc5ea4bd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766984510.132571,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring potential concerns about future pandemics","content":"The user is concerned about a future pandemic being more deadly and less cooperative.

Based on a national survey with over 3,000 participants, the report finds that while 60% believed the government managed the pandemic well, only 57% supported vaccine mandates, and 25% endorsed the right to refuse wearing masks. Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay highlighted lingering consequences five years on, including emotional trauma, family separations, and failures in safeguarding human rights. Stories include forced vaccinations under job threats, stillbirths, missed final goodbyes, and increased domestic violence during lockdowns. The report also critiques harsh measures like Melbourne's public housing lockdowns and state border closures, which often overlooked compassionate needs. Particularly affected communities included First Nations people, migrants, and individuals with disabilities. Former NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet expressed regret over vaccine mandates, stressing the importance of preserving freedoms. The Commission concludes that future emergency responses must prioritize human rights to rebuild public trust and avoid similar human suffering.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1742007060.0,"attribution":"www.news.com.au"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69520b4b5c448330896e3fa54d1a152c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing for Disease X, pandemic preparedness, and public attitudes","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"8c9b0ef9-06fe-4619-8707-33f1fc12aec0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"aaa3a6a6-ea75-4651-928a-087ef027f758","turn_exchange_id":"9f8c7032-f7fc-4d98-8800-e26a1e1f80b7"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa3a6a6-ea75-4651-928a-087ef027f758","children":["6139d1cd-8f36-4acf-b700-afdc296b6fe6"]},"6139d1cd-8f36-4acf-b700-afdc296b6fe6":{"id":"6139d1cd-8f36-4acf-b700-afdc296b6fe6","message":{"id":"6139d1cd-8f36-4acf-b700-afdc296b6fe6","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766984532.340443,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into compliance and trust trends for future pandemics","content":"The user\u2019s concern about reduced cooperation calls for examining factors like pandemic fatigue and public trust.

While 89% of respondents consider the shutdown a problem, 54% view it as a major issue, with Democrats expressing the highest concern. The poll shows shared blame: 58% hold both President Trump and congressional Republicans responsible, and 54% blame Democrats in Congress. Partisan splits are evident, with most Democrats blaming Trump and Republicans, and most Republicans blaming Democrats.\n\nThe shutdown was sparked by a dispute over the extension of Obamacare health insurance tax credits. Democrats are pressing for their renewal in exchange for supporting a funding bill, but the public remains lukewarm on the issue\u201442% have no opinion. The lack of strong public support complicates Democrats' position. Meanwhile, Republicans receive better marks on economic handling. Despite hints from Republicans about a possible compromise, talks have seen little progress. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is considering a vote to extend the tax credits alongside a government funding bill, though no commitment has been made.

Meanwhile, Congress faces a looming midnight deadline to pass legislation and prevent a shutdown. A stopgap bill was approved earlier by the House, but Senate Democrats oppose it, seeking to negotiate terms including healthcare subsidy extensions and restored funding for foreign aid and media programs. The negotiations, involving Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and President Trump, have stalled. Vice President JD Vance indicated the country was on the brink of a shutdown.

An overwhelming 84% believe COVID has permanently altered American life. Older and Democratic-leaning individuals are more likely to stay current with COVID boosters and monitor disease spread. There is also a near-even split on public health priorities: 41% favor focusing on healthy lifestyles and disease prevention, compared to 38% who prioritize research into treatments.

It is already affecting flights and federal workers, while a judge recently blocked politically charged layoffs.

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the accord as a victory for public health and international cooperation, ensuring better preparedness and reduced vulnerability in future pandemics. The agreement was passed at the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, although the United States, under President Donald Trump, has opted out and withdrawn from the WHO.\n\nInitially proposed in 2021 amid calls to prevent repeat failures experienced during COVID-19, progress was delayed due to mistrust between richer and poorer nations and widespread misinformation. A key unresolved issue, concerning pathogen access and benefit sharing (Pabs), will be addressed in an annex over the next year. The agreement will only open for signatures after this annex is finalized and will come into force once at least 60 countries sign.\n\nDespite U.S. opposition, including criticism from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the accord is seen as a significant achievement for WHO, especially amid funding challenges. Leaders emphasized the urgency of implementing the agreement\u2019s equitable health measures to prepare for future threats.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1747755510.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/landmark-global-pandemic-agreement-adopted-by-world-health-organization-members-2025-05-20/","title":"Landmark global pandemic agreement adopted by World Health Organization members","snippet":"On May 20, 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) members adopted a significant global agreement focused on pandemic preparedness, marking a key response to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic that claimed millions of lives from 2020 to 2022. After three years of negotiations, the legally binding treaty was approved during the World Health Assembly in Geneva, receiving broad support and applause. The agreement aims to enhance global readiness and coordination against future health crises and is considered a notable success for public health and international cooperation, especially at a time when organizations like the WHO face financial challenges, including major cuts in U.S. foreign funding.\n\nThe pact encountered a last-minute obstacle from Slovakia, whose vaccine-sceptic prime minister called for a vote. Ultimately, 124 countries voted in favor, none opposed, and 11\u2014including Poland, Israel, Italy, Russia, Slovakia, and Iran\u2014abstained.

The treaty was approved by a wide margin at the World Health Assembly, with 124 countries voting in favor and 11 abstaining, but notably without the participation of the United States. The absence followed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO on his Inauguration Day, citing alleged mismanagement and political bias during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe WHO Pandemic Agreement emphasizes equity, solidarity, transparency, and accountability in handling health emergencies. It includes provisions for strengthening domestic health systems and a proposed Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing System (PABS) to facilitate the global sharing of data and resources during outbreaks.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the agreement as a vital step for global health protection. However, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. criticized the deal as entrenching dysfunction within the WHO, promoting instead a complete overhaul of international health governance. Experts warn that the U.S.\u2019s absence could weaken global pandemic response efforts and broader public health initiatives.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1747776113.625,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69520b4b5c448330896e3fa54d1a152c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Critiquing Pandemic Policy Assumptions and Suggestions for Future Preparedness","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"8c9b0ef9-06fe-4619-8707-33f1fc12aec0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"3a96546a-99ee-4ee4-b7bd-cb9dba16c35a","turn_exchange_id":"9f8c7032-f7fc-4d98-8800-e26a1e1f80b7"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3a96546a-99ee-4ee4-b7bd-cb9dba16c35a","children":["f2f45464-c3ac-453b-82bd-db4c9bc5fab7"]},"f2f45464-c3ac-453b-82bd-db4c9bc5fab7":{"id":"f2f45464-c3ac-453b-82bd-db4c9bc5fab7","message":{"id":"f2f45464-c3ac-453b-82bd-db4c9bc5fab7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766984574.397453,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Structuring a balanced response to pandemic preparedness and compliance","content":"To start, I'll acknowledge that fear about future pandemics is natural, but the next pandemic's probability remains uncertain.\n\nNext, I'll address the claim that the next pathogen will be more deadly than before\u2014while plausible, \"twice as deadly\" is uncertain due to factors like transmissibility and case fatality rates.\n\nI'll also tackle the \"half as cooperative\" point: pandemic fatigue is a real concern, but trust plays a major role in willingness to comply.

Conversely, a pathogen with only modestly higher IFR can be catastrophic if it spreads faster or escapes immunity.\n\nSo: **a worse pandemic is absolutely within the planning envelope**\u2014but \u201c2\u00d7 deadlier\u201d doesn\u2019t map cleanly to \u201c2\u00d7 worse outcome.\u201d\n\n## 2) \u201cHalf as cooperative\u201d is too pessimistic as a blanket claim\nYou\u2019re picking up something real\u2014**fatigue, mistrust, politicization**\u2014but public cooperation tends to be **conditional**, not simply \u201clower forever.\u201d\n\nTwo useful anchors from recent evidence:\n\n- **Trust is one of the strongest predictors of compliance** with public-health policies across countries and over time. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- In the US, a nationally representative survey found **about half (49%)** were likely to support a set of future pandemic mitigation policies, while many expressed *mixed* support and **large majorities worried** policies would be politicized or economically harmful. That\u2019s not \u201cno compliance\u201d; it\u2019s \u201ccompliance comes with credibility constraints.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\nAlso, **severity can *increase* cooperation**. If hospitals are visibly overwhelmed and risk feels immediate, people often self-modify behavior even without mandates. The bigger risk isn\u2019t \u201cnobody will cooperate\u201d; it\u2019s **fragmented cooperation**: some comply intensely, others reject, and the social conflict becomes part of the harm.\n\n## 3) \u201cWest vs East\u201d is an oversimplification that can mislead you\nThere are real cultural/governance differences, but the more predictive split is usually:\n\n- **high-trust vs low-trust institutions**\n- **clear rules + fair support vs confusing rules + uneven burdens**\n- **credible messengers vs partisan/info-war environments**\n\nSingapore is not immune to the same dynamics (social media, imported narratives, inequality stress). The advantage Singapore *can* have is **state capacity and planning**\u2014and it\u2019s actively moving in that direction (e.g., the Communicable Diseases Agency operational from April 2025; Pandemic Preparedness and Response Framework launched July 2025). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \nBut capacity only helps if it\u2019s paired with legitimacy.\n\n## 4) The strategic fix: design responses that need *less* \u201cheroic compliance\u201d\nIf you assume cooperation will be patchier next time, the goal is to **reduce how much you need it**.\n\nHigh-leverage moves (policy + society), in plain terms:\n\n- **Cleaner indoor air as baseline infrastructure** (ventilation standards, filtration, CO\u2082 monitoring). This cuts spread without asking people to \u201cbehave better\u201d every day.\n- **Fast medical countermeasures** (platform vaccines, rapid diagnostics, stockpiled antivirals) so restrictions can be shorter and more targeted.\n- **Pre-committed triggers and timeboxes** (\u201cif ICU occupancy hits X, we do Y for 21 days, then re-evaluate\u201d) to avoid the \u201cindefinite emergency\u201d backlash.\n- **Fair compensation / support** (paid sick leave, isolation support) so compliance doesn\u2019t feel like a one-way sacrifice.\n- **Radical transparency** (what we know, what we don\u2019t, what would change our mind), because once credibility is lost, coercion becomes the only tool\u2014and it performs badly.\n\nGlobally, there\u2019s also movement toward better coordination (the **WHO Pandemic Agreement** adopted May 20, 2025), though it won\u2019t magically solve politics. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search14\ue202turn2search2\ue201\n\n## 5) What you can do personally (without spiraling)\nIf you want a \u201ccalm preparedness\u201d posture:\n\n- Keep a small buffer of basics (masks that seal well, fever meds, a few days of essentials).\n- Treat indoor air like water quality: prioritize good ventilation in your own spaces.\n- Build a \u201ctrusted sources\u201d shortlist now (so you\u2019re not sorting truth from noise mid-crisis).\n- Decide in advance what your thresholds are for behavior changes (e.g., \u201cif local hospitals are strained, I reduce contacts / mask on transit\u201d).\n\nIf you want, tell me what worries you more: **(A)** the *pathogen* (deadlier biology) or **(B)** the *social fracture* (non-cooperation/polarization). The practical playbook is slightly different.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Related reading\ue202turn1news42,turn2news42,turn2news41,turn0news45\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search21\ue201","start_idx":191,"end_idx":224,"safe_urls":["https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-disease-x","https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-disease-x?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099%2822%2900670-3.pdf","https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099%2822%2900670-3.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Johns Hopkins Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-disease-x?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"What is Disease X | Johns Hopkins","url":"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-disease-x?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"15 Feb 2024 \u2014 Disease X is a placeholder concept that refers to a pandemic pathogen that has not yet been characterized.

Measles vaccination rates have dropped in 100 of 204 countries, and coverage for key vaccines like diphtheria, tetanus, and polio has declined in many high-income nations, including the US, UK, France, and Japan. The setbacks are attributed to persistent health disparities, the impact of Covid-19, and rising misinformation and vaccine hesitancy. Experts warn that without urgent action, global immunization targets for 2030 will not be met, and outbreaks of diseases like measles and polio may escalate. The study emphasizes the need for targeted improvements, renewed public trust, and efforts to combat misinformation to ensure all children are protected.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1750804226.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/02aa5d5296e8609f5004f88950af3a0c","title":"14 million children did not receive a single vaccine in 2024, UN estimates","snippet":"In 2024, over 14 million children worldwide did not receive a single vaccine, maintaining the same level of non-vaccination as the previous year, according to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. The report highlights that just nine countries\u2014including Nigeria, India, Sudan, and Afghanistan\u2014accounted for more than half of these unprotected children. Although 89% of infants received the first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (DTaP) vaccine, only 85% completed the full three-dose series, a slight improvement over 2023.\n\nThe reduction in international aid, including the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO and cuts to vaccine funding under President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is expected to hinder progress in increasing vaccination rates. Misinformation surrounding vaccines also poses a significant threat.\n\nVaccine access remains unequally distributed, with conflict zones like Sudan having the lowest coverage. While global measles vaccination coverage has slightly improved to 76%, it remains far below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. Measles cases have surged globally, especially in the U.S. and Europe, with the U.K. reporting its first measles-related child death in years.

After three years of negotiations, the legally binding treaty was approved during the World Health Assembly in Geneva, receiving broad support and applause. The agreement aims to enhance global readiness and coordination against future health crises and is considered a notable success for public health and international cooperation, especially at a time when organizations like the WHO face financial challenges, including major cuts in U.S. foreign funding.\n\nThe pact encountered a last-minute obstacle from Slovakia, whose vaccine-sceptic prime minister called for a vote. Ultimately, 124 countries voted in favor, none opposed, and 11\u2014including Poland, Israel, Italy, Russia, Slovakia, and Iran\u2014abstained. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the agreement as a triumph for science, public health, and multilateralism.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1747728432.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/20/who-pandemic-agreement-world-health-rfk-kennedy/","title":"WHO signs international pandemic response treaty without the U.S.","snippet":"On May 20, 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the world\u2019s first comprehensive pandemic response agreement, aimed at enhancing global preparedness and international cooperation for future pandemics. The treaty was approved by a wide margin at the World Health Assembly, with 124 countries voting in favor and 11 abstaining, but notably without the participation of the United States. The absence followed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO on his Inauguration Day, citing alleged mismanagement and political bias during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe WHO Pandemic Agreement emphasizes equity, solidarity, transparency, and accountability in handling health emergencies. It includes provisions for strengthening domestic health systems and a proposed Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing System (PABS) to facilitate the global sharing of data and resources during outbreaks.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the agreement as a vital step for global health protection. However, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. criticized the deal as entrenching dysfunction within the WHO, promoting instead a complete overhaul of international health governance. Experts warn that the U.S.\u2019s absence could weaken global pandemic response efforts and broader public health initiatives.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1747776113.625,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/20/world-agrees-pandemic-accord-for-tackling-outbreaks-of-disease-who-covid","title":"World agrees pandemic accord for tackling outbreaks of disease","snippet":"After three years of negotiations, global leaders have adopted a new World Health Organization (WHO) Pandemic Agreement aimed at improving the global response to future disease outbreaks. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the accord as a victory for public health and international cooperation, ensuring better preparedness and reduced vulnerability in future pandemics. The agreement was passed at the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, although the United States, under President Donald Trump, has opted out and withdrawn from the WHO.\n\nInitially proposed in 2021 amid calls to prevent repeat failures experienced during COVID-19, progress was delayed due to mistrust between richer and poorer nations and widespread misinformation. A key unresolved issue, concerning pathogen access and benefit sharing (Pabs), will be addressed in an annex over the next year. The agreement will only open for signatures after this annex is finalized and will come into force once at least 60 countries sign.\n\nDespite U.S. opposition, including criticism from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the accord is seen as a significant achievement for WHO, especially amid funding challenges. Leaders emphasized the urgency of implementing the agreement\u2019s equitable health measures to prepare for future threats.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1747755510.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69520dc7146c83228b9c73d119061eb0","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for WHO pandemic agreement and Singapore plans","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5d83a405-2d69-47b7-8ac6-eaa2cf97c6a5","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"e86385b7-daa8-4202-888e-c56d0fbbe12b","turn_exchange_id":"3a924317-4573-4739-9bb5-d7201124cf01"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e86385b7-daa8-4202-888e-c56d0fbbe12b","children":["4c8f8a2d-62ae-4f7f-9de1-26ce844da09f"]},"4c8f8a2d-62ae-4f7f-9de1-26ce844da09f":{"id":"4c8f8a2d-62ae-4f7f-9de1-26ce844da09f","message":{"id":"4c8f8a2d-62ae-4f7f-9de1-26ce844da09f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766985185.415334,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Addressing pandemic fatigue and vaccine hesitancy","content":"I\u2019ll highlight evidence on pandemic fatigue from WHO IHR, and how it has lowered adherence to public health measures.

The measles vaccine has prevented approximately 59 million deaths worldwide, with annual fatalities falling nearly 88% to 95,000 over 24 years. Despite these achievements, 2024 witnessed an 8% increase in cases compared to pre-pandemic 2019, although deaths declined by 11%, largely due to more infections occurring in middle-income countries with lower fatality rates.\n\nThe WHO warns measles, as one of the most contagious viruses, quickly exploits gaps in immunity, emphasizing that even minor drops in vaccination can lead to outbreaks. In 2024, 59 countries experienced major measles outbreaks\u2014three times the number in 2021\u2014including high-income nations like Canada (which lost its elimination status), the U.S., and Mexico. The resurgence underscores vulnerabilities in immunization systems. Funding cuts to global measles programs, spurred by the U.S. withdrawal as a top WHO donor, further threaten progress. In 2024, 84% of children globally received their first vaccine dose, and 76% received the second\u2014still below the 95% target needed for optimal protection.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1764331635.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/24/children-global-vaccine-rates-fall-study-finds","title":"Millions of children at risk as global vaccine rates fall, study finds","snippet":"A new large-scale study published in *The Lancet* finds that millions of children globally are at increased risk of deadly, preventable diseases due to stagnant or declining vaccination coverage. Though childhood immunization efforts over the past 50 years have saved an estimated 154 million lives and reduced the number of unvaccinated children significantly\u2014from 58.8 million in 1980 to 14.7 million in 2019\u2014progress has slowed or reversed since 2010. Measles vaccination rates have dropped in 100 of 204 countries, and coverage for key vaccines like diphtheria, tetanus, and polio has declined in many high-income nations, including the US, UK, France, and Japan. The setbacks are attributed to persistent health disparities, the impact of Covid-19, and rising misinformation and vaccine hesitancy. Experts warn that without urgent action, global immunization targets for 2030 will not be met, and outbreaks of diseases like measles and polio may escalate. The study emphasizes the need for targeted improvements, renewed public trust, and efforts to combat misinformation to ensure all children are protected.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1750804226.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/2f888732cc297090238956986fd89cc4","title":"Measles cases in Europe and Central Asia doubled last year to the highest reported level since 1997","snippet":"In 2024, measles cases in Europe and Central Asia more than doubled from the previous year, reaching 127,350\u2014the highest number since 1997\u2014according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. Romania and Kazakhstan were the hardest hit, with over 30,000 and 28,000 cases respectively. Approximately 40% of infections occurred in children under five, and over half of all patients required hospitalization. The highly contagious airborne virus causes respiratory symptoms and complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis and is preventable by two doses of a vaccine that is 97% effective.\n\nHealth officials blame the rise in cases on a decline in vaccination coverage, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro have had low vaccination rates for years, far below the 95% threshold needed to prevent outbreaks. Misinformation about vaccine safety continues to hinder immunization efforts, despite extensive evidence discrediting the alleged link between vaccines and autism. Other regions like the U.S. are also experiencing ongoing outbreaks.

The strategy, developed by Google\u2019s Jigsaw division, aims to educate people on how to recognize common misinformation techniques\u2014such as fear-mongering, exaggeration, and false comparisons\u2014before they encounter false claims online. Google will run short, engaging videos as ads on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. A similar campaign is also being developed for India.\n\nPrebunking, which researchers and tech companies increasingly support, is considered a cost-effective and scalable way to combat misinformation. In a large-scale trial across Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, 38 million people viewed prebunking videos, significantly improving their ability to detect misinformation. However, cultural and linguistic tailoring are crucial, as effectiveness varied across regions.\n\nUnlike fact-checking and content moderation\u2014which face challenges of reach, resource intensity, and political backlash\u2014prebunking avoids controversial topics by focusing on manipulation techniques. Google\u2019s German campaign will include a focus on misleading multimedia content and will be announced ahead of the Munich Security Conference. Experts believe that prebunking, combined with other efforts, could help build public resilience to misinformation, akin to herd immunity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1676264798.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69520dc7146c83228b9c73d119061eb0","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Addressing Global Misinformation and Pandemic Fatigue Effects","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5d83a405-2d69-47b7-8ac6-eaa2cf97c6a5","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"6e12a163-4e55-4a9e-a864-a298acb3b8ac","turn_exchange_id":"3a924317-4573-4739-9bb5-d7201124cf01"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6e12a163-4e55-4a9e-a864-a298acb3b8ac","children":["54eb06bb-9af9-4017-aa97-dc64eaaf8e1b"]},"54eb06bb-9af9-4017-aa97-dc64eaaf8e1b":{"id":"54eb06bb-9af9-4017-aa97-dc64eaaf8e1b","message":{"id":"54eb06bb-9af9-4017-aa97-dc64eaaf8e1b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766985227.961322,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Addressing user concerns: global risk and local resilience","content":"To tackle misinformation, we can reference WHO infodemic management guidelines along with PAHO and NIHR reviews to support strategies.

Even if Singapore does \u201ceverything right,\u201d we\u2019re a travel + trade hub, so **other countries\u2019 low cooperation can still hit us hard**\u2014biologically, economically, and informationally.\n\n## How other countries\u2019 low cooperation can affect Singapore materially\n\n**1) More importations + longer tail risk**\nIf outbreaks are poorly contained elsewhere (low testing, low vaccination uptake, weak isolation norms), Singapore faces more frequent \u201csparks\u201d coming in via travel. That doesn\u2019t guarantee a huge local wave, but it raises the cost: more surveillance, more healthcare load, more disruptions.\n\n**2) Faster variant / strain evolution**\nSustained high transmission globally increases the chances of a more immune-evasive or more severe variant emerging, which can reset the local risk picture even with good domestic systems.\n\n**3) Supply-chain and services shock**\nEven if local transmission is controlled, a big global wave can still disrupt:\n- shipping and aviation capacity,\n- imported medical supplies / active pharmaceutical ingredients,\n- tourism, business travel, and regional demand.\n\nCOVID gave a live demo that \u201cdomestic control\u201d and \u201ceconomic insulation\u201d are different things.\n\n**4) Countermeasure nationalism / coordination failures**\nWhen trust is low internationally, data-sharing and equitable access (vaccines/antivirals/diagnostics) can become slower and more competitive\u2014exactly the kind of situation the WHO\u2019s Pandemic Agreement is trying to reduce. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201\n\n## Pandemic fatigue is real, and institutions are explicitly worried about it\nThe WHO\u2019s COVID-19 Emergency Committee explicitly noted **pandemic fatigue** and reduced risk perception leading to \u201cdrastically reduced\u201d use of public-health and social measures. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \nThat matters because when fatigue rises, governments become less willing to impose blunt restrictions, and the public becomes less willing to comply\u2014so you need responses that rely less on \u201cheroic compliance.\u201d\n\n## Vaccine misinformation is not a fringe problem globally\u2014and it has measurable effects\nTwo data points that support your \u201cloud minority + fatigue\u201d concern:\n\n- UNICEF reported that the perceived importance of childhood vaccines **declined during COVID-19 in 52 of 55 countries studied**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- WHO/UNICEF/Gavi warned in 2025 that immunization efforts are under growing threat from **misinformation** (alongside crises, funding issues, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\nAnd Singapore isn\u2019t magically sealed off from this: MOH has repeatedly had to issue clarifications on circulating vaccine misinformation (e.g., June 2025). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201  \nAlso, even with high primary-series coverage, booster hesitancy can be substantial (one local write-up notes >30% reporting booster-hesitancy in a study). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search10\ue201  \nSo: I agree Singapore is comparatively well-positioned, but **it\u2019s not cost-free** to assume \u201cSingaporeans will do the right thing\u201d\u2014pockets of skepticism can still matter, especially when clustered.\n\n## What\u2019s the best hedge, given the world may be less cooperative?\n\n**A) Build \u201clow-compliance-needed\u201d defenses**\n- indoor air standards (ventilation/filtration) as infrastructure,\n- healthcare surge capacity + stockpiles,\n- fast testing + sequencing + wastewater surveillance,\n- rapid vaccine/antiviral deployment pipelines.\n\nSingapore is explicitly updating national preparedness (e.g., CDA became operational April 2025; framework launched July 2025). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n**B) Plan for targeted border friction rather than blanket shutdowns**\nIf the next event happens in a low-cooperation world, Singapore will likely need **more calibrated border health measures** (testing, targeted advisories, temporary requirements) to buy time, rather than trying to \u201clock the world out\u201d indefinitely.\n\n**C) Treat misinformation response as public-health capability**\nWHO frames this as \u201cinfodemic management\u201d (systematically listening to narratives, communicating risk, building resilience, engaging communities). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \nOperationally, a lot of experts now emphasize **prebunking** (inoculating people against manipulation tactics before falsehoods spread) in addition to debunking. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue201  \n\nIf you want a single sentence summary: *assume the next time you don\u2019t get perfect compliance\u2014so design measures that still work when compliance is patchy.*\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent background
