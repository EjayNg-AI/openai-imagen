That means making products that are genuinely useful, speaking honestly about risks and benefits, and working with anyone serious about getting this right. I strongly agree with Vice President JD Vance's recent comments on AI\u2014particularly his point that we need to maximize applications that help people, like breakthroughs in medicine and disease prevention, while minimizing the harmful ones. This position is both wise and what the public overwhelmingly wants.\r\n\r\nAnthropic is the fastest-growing software company in history, with revenue growing from a $1B to $7B run rate over the last nine months, and we've managed to do this while deploying AI thoughtfully and responsibly. There are products we will not build and risks we will not take, even if they would make money.\r\n\r\nOur longstanding position is that managing the societal impacts of AI should be a matter of policy over politics. I fully believe that Anthropic, the administration, and leaders across the political spectrum want the same thing: to ensure that powerful AI technology benefits the American people and that America advances and secures its lead in AI development.\r\n\r\nDespite our track record of communicating frequently and transparently about our positions, there has been a recent uptick in inaccurate claims about Anthropic's policy stances. Some are significant enough that they warrant setting the record straight.\r\n\r\nOur alignment with the Trump administration on key areas of AI policy\r\n\r\nWe work directly with the federal government in several ways. In July the Department of War awarded Anthropic a two-year, $200 million agreement to prototype frontier AI capabilities that advance national security. We have partnered with the General Services Administration to offer Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government for $1 across the federal government. And Claude is deployed across classified networks through partners like Palantir and at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\r\nAnthropic publicly praised President Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan. We have been supportive of the President\u2019s efforts to expand energy provision in the US in order to win the AI race, and I personally attended an AI and energy summit in Pennsylvania with President Trump, where he and I had a good conversation about US leadership in AI. Anthropic\u2019s Chief Product Officer attended a White House event where we joined a pledge to accelerate healthcare applications of AI, and our Head of External Affairs attended the White House\u2019s AI Education Taskforce event to support their efforts to advance AI fluency for teachers.\r\nEvery major AI company has hired policy experts from both parties and recent administrations\u2014Anthropic is no different. We've hired Republicans and Democrats alike, and built an advisory council that includes senior former Trump administration officials. Anthropic makes hiring decisions based on candidates' expertise, integrity, and competence, not their political affiliations.\r\nWe (and many other organizations) respectfully disagreed with a single proposed amendment in the One Big Beautiful Bill: the 10-year moratorium on state-level AI laws, which would have blocked any action without offering a federal alternative. That specific provision was voted down by Republicans and Democrats in a 99-1 vote in the Senate. Our longstanding position has been that a uniform federal approach is preferable to a patchwork of state laws. I proposed such a standard months ago and we\u2019re ready to work with both parties to make it happen.\r\nOur preference for a national AI standard\r\n\r\nWhile we continue to advocate for that federal standard, AI is moving so fast that we can\u2019t wait for Congress to act. We therefore supported a carefully designed bill in California where most of America\u2019s leading AI labs are headquartered, including Anthropic. This bill, SB 53, requires the largest AI developers to make their frontier model safety protocols public and is written to exempt any company with an annual gross revenue below $500M\u2014therefore only applying to the very largest AI companies. Anthropic supported this exemption to protect startups and in fact proposed an early version of it.\r\nSome have suggested that we are somehow interested in harming the startup ecosystem. Startups are among our most important customers. We work with tens of thousands of startups and partner with hundreds of accelerators and VCs. Claude is powering an entirely new generation of AI-native companies. Damaging that ecosystem makes no sense for us.\r\nI've heard arguments that state AI regulation could slow down the US AI industry and hand China the lead. But the real risk to American AI leadership isn't a single state law that only applies to the largest companies\u2014it's filling the PRC's data centers with US chips they can't make themselves. We agree with leaders like Senators Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley that this would only help the Chinese Communist Party win the race to the AI frontier. We are the only frontier AI company to restrict the selling of AI services to PRC-controlled companies, forgoing significant short-term revenue to prevent fueling AI platforms and applications that would help the Chinese Communist Party's military and intelligence services.\r\nOur progress on an AI industry-wide challenge: model bias\r\n\r\nSome have claimed that Anthropic's models are uniquely politically biased. This is not only unfounded but directly contradicted by the data. A January study from the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, found Anthropic's main model (at the time, Claude Sonnet 3.5) to be less politically biased than models from most of the other major providers. Data from a Stanford study in May, on user perceptions of bias in AI models, shows no reason to single out Anthropic: many models from other providers were rated as more biased. The system cards for our latest models, Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5, show that we\u2019re making rapid progress towards our goal of political neutrality.\r\nAs a broader point, no AI model, from any provider, is fully politically balanced in every reply. Models learn from their training data in ways that are not yet well-understood, and developers are never fully in control of their outputs. Anyone can cherry-pick outputs from any model to make it appear slanted in a particular direction.\r\nAnthropic is committed to constructive engagement on matters of public policy. When we agree, we say so. When we don\u2019t, we propose an alternative for consideration. We do this because we are a public benefit corporation with a mission to ensure that AI benefits everyone and to maintain America's lead in AI. Again, we believe we share those goals with the Trump administration, both sides of Congress, and the public. We are going to keep being honest and straightforward, and will stand up for the policies we believe are right. The stakes of this technology are too great for us to do otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn his recent remarks, the Vice President also said of AI, \"Is it good or is it bad, or is it going to help us or going to hurt us? The answer is probably both, and we should be trying to maximize as much of the good and minimize as much of the bad.\" That perfectly captures our view. We're ready to work in good faith with anyone of any political stripe to make that vision a reality."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"d72426fb-5b99-4995-ad61-3dd06050d2ad","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"799297dd-7638-4a8e-8729-ebbfc45e6590","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"81514849-ecb9-40ac-ac93-cd8f5b35418d","children":["47e3dd36-eeb7-4a1a-b697-cdf62e6885c7"]},"47e3dd36-eeb7-4a1a-b697-cdf62e6885c7":{"id":"47e3dd36-eeb7-4a1a-b697-cdf62e6885c7","message":{"id":"47e3dd36-eeb7-4a1a-b697-cdf62e6885c7","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761056175.8217752,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"d72426fb-5b99-4995-ad61-3dd06050d2ad","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"50ec9799-a451-4d88-b677-6b056976b205","turn_exchange_id":"799297dd-7638-4a8e-8729-ebbfc45e6590","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"50ec9799-a451-4d88-b677-6b056976b205","children":["1b03b0c1-6b88-436f-92b2-14f6df9fb3cc"]},"1b03b0c1-6b88-436f-92b2-14f6df9fb3cc":{"id":"1b03b0c1-6b88-436f-92b2-14f6df9fb3cc","message":{"id":"1b03b0c1-6b88-436f-92b2-14f6df9fb3cc","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761056175.8286612,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"d72426fb-5b99-4995-ad61-3dd06050d2ad","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"47e3dd36-eeb7-4a1a-b697-cdf62e6885c7","turn_exchange_id":"799297dd-7638-4a8e-8729-ebbfc45e6590","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"47e3dd36-eeb7-4a1a-b697-cdf62e6885c7","children":["673b0c3b-0bc4-4ed8-ac37-170ab05b2824"]},"673b0c3b-0bc4-4ed8-ac37-170ab05b2824":{"id":"673b0c3b-0bc4-4ed8-ac37-170ab05b2824","message":{"id":"673b0c3b-0bc4-4ed8-ac37-170ab05b2824","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761056175.8421907,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","request_id":"d72426fb-5b99-4995-ad61-3dd06050d2ad","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"1b03b0c1-6b88-436f-92b2-14f6df9fb3cc","turn_exchange_id":"799297dd-7638-4a8e-8729-ebbfc45e6590","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1b03b0c1-6b88-436f-92b2-14f6df9fb3cc","children":["38a90d2d-a4ae-4e4e-9fa7-a5341df08a74"]},"38a90d2d-a4ae-4e4e-9fa7-a5341df08a74":{"id":"38a90d2d-a4ae-4e4e-9fa7-a5341df08a74","message":{"id":"38a90d2d-a4ae-4e4e-9fa7-a5341df08a74","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761056176.723684,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into Dario Amodei's remarks","content":"I need to verify Dario Amodei\u2019s latest statements, especially about the California SB 53 bill and revenue claims.

The moratorium, part of President Donald Trump's tax cut bill, seeks to override recent AI regulations implemented by various states. Amodei argued that such a ban would hinder both state action and the development of a cohesive national policy. Instead, he advocated for a federal transparency standard requiring AI developers to disclose testing methods and risk mitigation strategies, especially regarding national security. He emphasized the importance of holding AI companies accountable for ensuring model safety before public deployment. Amodei noted that Anthropic, along with competitors OpenAI and Google DeepMind, already follow such disclosure practices. However, he stressed that legislative measures may be needed to maintain transparency as AI models grow more powerful and corporate motivations evolve.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51},"pub_date":1749122856.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f795bf8ee0832892842fecc07c72a7","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Verifying Dario Amodei's statement and related claims","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"d72426fb-5b99-4995-ad61-3dd06050d2ad","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"58a65740-bb3d-4531-ab26-31bcc6064869","turn_exchange_id":"799297dd-7638-4a8e-8729-ebbfc45e6590","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"58a65740-bb3d-4531-ab26-31bcc6064869","children":["76d783da-ae7d-48eb-ae2b-d23dd970ad9a"]},"76d783da-ae7d-48eb-ae2b-d23dd970ad9a":{"id":"76d783da-ae7d-48eb-ae2b-d23dd970ad9a","message":{"id":"76d783da-ae7d-48eb-ae2b-d23dd970ad9a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761056198.598578,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Checking PRC service restrictions","content":"I also need to verify the claim about PRC service restrictions.

This unprecedented move among American AI firms aims to prevent China, and other U.S. adversaries like Russia, Iran, and North Korea, from leveraging advanced AI for military or intelligence purposes. The policy applies immediately and encompasses major Chinese firms like ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, as well as indirect access via cloud platforms. The shift aligns with Anthropic's commitment to ensure AI development supports democratic values and U.S. leadership.\n\nThe decision is influenced by growing concerns that Chinese corporations, particularly those setting up offshore subsidiaries in countries like Singapore, might circumvent export restrictions to access U.S. technology. It follows broader U.S. efforts to tighten export controls on AI and hardware, with Anthropic\u2019s CEO previously advocating for stronger regulations. The financial impact is expected to be in the low hundreds of millions of dollars, but the company believes the move is necessary to address national security threats and highlight the risks of unauthorized access, as highlighted by incidents like DeepSeek's alleged misuse of OpenAI models.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1757019947.02,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/anthropic-blocks-chinese-firms-from-claude","title":"Anthropic blocks Chinese-controlled firms from Claude AI - cites 'legal, regulatory, and security risks'","snippet":"On September 5, 2025, Anthropic updated its terms of service to ban access to its Claude AI models for any companies majority-owned or controlled by Chinese entities, regardless of their geographic location. This decision applies to all Claude models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and related developer tools. The company cited concerns over legal, regulatory, and security risks, particularly the potential for misuse by adversarial military and intelligence services from authoritarian regimes.\n\nAffected firms include major Chinese tech corporations like ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, as well as their subsidiaries and foreign branches. Although Anthropic acknowledged the policy could result in revenue losses in the low hundreds of millions of dollars, it emphasized the importance of protecting U.S. AI technology.\n\nIn response, Chinese AI startups like Zhipu quickly released migration tools, notably offering a GLM-4.5 API with lower costs and compatibility with Claude workflows. Similarly, Alibaba previously responded to OpenAI\u2019s restrictions with its Qwen-plus model. The block presents a serious challenge for enterprises already using Claude for critical business functions, leaving them to reconsider using local models or adopting multicloud strategies.

The users reportedly sought proposals for social media surveillance tools, which OpenAI considered a misuse of its generative AI. The company\u2019s public threat report also states that Chinese-language accounts used ChatGPT to support phishing and malware operations and explored further automation through China\u2019s DeepSeek platform.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI took action against accounts tied to Russian-speaking criminal groups who used the AI model to develop malware. Since beginning public threat reporting in February of the previous year, the company has disrupted over 40 malicious networks. OpenAI emphasized that its models did not provide new offensive capabilities to threat actors.\n\nThe report highlights growing safety concerns amid increasing U.S.-China technological rivalry. Despite the controversy, OpenAI now boasts over 800 million weekly ChatGPT users and recently reached a $500 billion valuation after a secondary share sale. The Chinese embassy in the U.S. has not commented on the situation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1759837823.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f795bf8ee0832892842fecc07c72a7","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching policies on AI service restrictions in PRC","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"d72426fb-5b99-4995-ad61-3dd06050d2ad","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"1e6ff639-281b-48df-b81a-45130e013e01","turn_exchange_id":"799297dd-7638-4a8e-8729-ebbfc45e6590","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1e6ff639-281b-48df-b81a-45130e013e01","children":["0490627a-bb49-4988-ac92-11accec3544d"]},"0490627a-bb49-4988-ac92-11accec3544d":{"id":"0490627a-bb49-4988-ac92-11accec3544d","message":{"id":"0490627a-bb49-4988-ac92-11accec3544d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761056205.353683,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Fact-checking and revenue claim","content":"I\u2019ve got enough to critique here.

The company is targeting $9 billion in revenue by the end of 2025 and has set a 2026 goal of $20 billion to $26 billion. This growth is driven by strong demand for its enterprise-focused generative AI tools, including the popular Claude Code and its newly launched cost-effective model, Haiku 4.5.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s enterprise products serve over 300,000 business customers, accounting for 80% of its income. The company recently stated that its current run rate is nearing $7 billion, up from $5 billion in August. It is positioning itself as a major competitor to OpenAI, which reported $13 billion in annualized revenue in August 2025. Benefiting from partnerships with Google and Amazon, Anthropic was valued at $183 billion after a recent Series F funding round. It emphasizes AI safety and plans global expansion, including a new office in Bengaluru, India, in 2026, and scaling its international team to support demand growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":16},"pub_date":1760552308.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/default/artificial-intelligencer-inside-anthropics-ambitious-2026-revenue-goal-2025-10-16/","title":"Artificial Intelligencer-Inside Anthropic's ambitious 2026 revenue goal","snippet":"In the October 16, 2025 edition of *Artificial Intelligencer*, the newsletter highlights the stabilizing role AI investment is playing amid global economic tensions, such as new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. AI-driven growth is credited with supporting U.S. GDP projections, with the IMF slightly raising its 2025-2026 outlook. Despite concerns that the AI hype outpaces current economic benefits, investment in data centers and foreign tech imports remains strong.\n\nA central focus is on Anthropic\u2019s explosive growth. The AI firm behind Claude is projected to skyrocket from a $1 billion revenue run rate at the start of 2025 to potentially $26 billion in 2026. Currently nearing a $7 billion run rate, Anthropic experienced a massive valuation jump to $183 billion following a major funding round. Business clients account for 80% of its revenue, and products like Claude Code and strategic moves, such as government AI deals and international expansion, contribute to its growth. Despite rising revenue, climbing costs for training and infrastructure pose long-term profitability questions.\n\nOther topics include China\u2019s rise in open-source AI with Alibaba\u2019s Qwen surpassing Meta\u2019s Llama model, and new research showing that AI responds more effectively to direct, even rude, prompts than polite ones.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17},"pub_date":1760614565.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-tech-startup-anthropic-unveils-cheaper-model-widen-ais-appeal-2025-10-15/","title":"US tech startup Anthropic unveils cheaper model to widen AI's appeal","snippet":"Anthropic, a San Francisco-based AI startup, unveiled an updated version of its smallest language model, Haiku 4.5, targeting companies seeking cost-effective but capable AI tools.

This move is intended to attract traditional businesses outside Silicon Valley looking to adopt AI on a larger scale without incurring high computational expenses. According to Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger, smaller models allow for economical and scalable deployment across large workforces.\n\nAnthropic, founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees, has over 300,000 enterprise customers and derives about 80% of its revenue from corporate clients. Its annual revenue run rate is close to $7 billion. The company also generates income through its consumer-facing chatbot, Claude.

The contract is with the **Department of Defense** (CDAO), not any \u201cDepartment of War.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- Strategically, Anthropic is doubling down on *enterprise + government* (revenue scale, security posture, export-control alignment) and staking out a \u201chawkish\u201d stance on PRC access that\u2019s more restrictive than peers\u2014plausibly unique in its bright-line rule for PRC-controlled companies. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1news20\ue202turn1news21\ue201\n\n---\n\n## What\u2019s substantively new (or newly explicit)?\n1) **National-security alignment.**  \n   The statement highlights a two-year, up-to-$200M DoD prototype agreement (July 2025) and deployments in classified environments. This is real (DoD/CDAO), but the text misnames the agency (\u201cDepartment of War\u201d). The underlying contract exists and is sizable for a still-young lab. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n2) **Policy line: federal standard preferred, but state action tolerated if narrow.**  \n   Amodei reiterates opposition to a decade-long pre-emption of state AI laws (the \u201c10-year moratorium\u201d), consistent with his earlier op-ed stance; at the same time he endorses California\u2019s SB 53, which targets only very large developers (>$500M revenue; 10^26 FLOP threshold) and focuses on public safety-protocol disclosures. This reconciles \u201cno patchwork\u201d rhetoric with a practical willingness to move via states while Congress lags. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news51\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n3) **China policy: bright-line restriction on PRC-controlled companies.**  \n   Anthropic recently announced it will not sell to firms majority-owned/controlled by PRC entities\u2014including offshore subsidiaries. That is stricter and more categorical than the typical \u201cterms-of-use + threat takedowns\u201d approach others emphasize; coverage framed it as unprecedented among U.S. labs. Whether it\u2019s literally unique is hard to *prove*, but reporting and Anthropic\u2019s own notice support the claim that it\u2019s an unusually hard line. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1news20\ue202turn1news21\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Claims that check out vs. claims that need salt\n\n**Checks out (with caveats):**\n- **DoD agreement and federal deployments.** The DoD/CDAO award is public; classified-network use via partners has been reported in trade press and company materials (the exact breadth is harder to independently verify, but the partnership vector is consistent with how such access usually happens). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- **Bias studies.** A Manhattan Institute paper (Jan 2025) indeed finds partisan effects across models and ranks Claude (then Sonnet 3.5) among the *less* biased by its metrics; a Stanford-affiliated piece on perceived bias (May 2025, GSB) reports *widespread* user perceptions of bias across vendors\u2014i.e., nothing uniquely damning about one lab. Methodology varies, so these are not universal arbiters, but the citation use is fair. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- **SB 53 scope and startup exemption.** The final bill text and legislative analysis show the >$500M revenue gate and the transparency-first framing that largely spares startups. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n**Needs salt / invites questions:**\n- **\u201cFastest-growing software company in history; $1B \u2192 $7B run-rate in nine months.\u201d** Reuters and others have recently cited run-rate figures \u201cnearing $7B,\u201d with targets of $9B ARR by year-end; Anthropic itself said $1B at the start of 2025 and >$5B by August. The growth is extraordinary, but \u201cfastest in history\u201d is a high bar and depends on *how* ARR is computed. Treat it as marketing-grade unless independently benchmarked against historical comps (e.g., OpenAI\u2019s 2025 cadence). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2news16\ue202turn2news18\ue201  \n- **\u201cOnly frontier AI company to restrict sales to PRC-controlled firms.\u201d** The policy *is* unusually categorical. However, other labs have stepped up enforcement against PRC-linked misuse and discussed restrictions (e.g., OpenAI threat reports, access limits). Anthropic\u2019s *ownership-based* bright line appears tougher, but \u201conly\u201d is a moving target\u2014watch for competitor policy updates. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1news22\ue201  \n- **The \u201cDepartment of War\u201d reference.** This is simply incorrect phrasing for a U.S. federal department in 2025; it should read Department of Defense. It\u2019s a minor slip, but in a policy statement it undercuts the claim of precision. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Strategic reading\n- **Audience:** Washington, enterprise CIOs, and investors. The piece reassures national-security stakeholders that Anthropic is \u201con-side,\u201d tells startups \u201cwe\u2019re not trying to crush you,\u201d and signals to markets that revenue growth isn\u2019t coming at the expense of caution. The combination of DoD work, SB 53 support, and PRC restrictions triangulates a *security-centric, transparency-first* brand. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n- **Regulatory bet:** By championing a federal standard while tolerating a narrow state law, Anthropic hedges\u2014benefiting from a de facto early standard (SB 53) that raises disclosure expectations for direct peers without burdening its customer base of startups. This is *not* classic regulatory capture (it\u2019s disclosure-oriented, not licensing), but it *does* entrench the largest labs as the only ones bound by frontier transparency requirements in the near term. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search10\ue201\n- **Geopolitical posture:** The PRC bright-line is costly (short-term revenue) but buys political capital and differentiates Anthropic on \u201cresponsible export\u201d grounds just as U.S. export policy tightens. It may also reduce future CFIUS or procurement friction. The risk: retaliation or forced localization by multinational customers with China footprints. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news20\ue202turn1news21\ue201\n- **Commercial model:** Recent reporting shows Anthropic\u2019s revenue now heavily enterprise-weighted with rapid ARR acceleration. That aligns with this statement\u2019s emphasis on government and large-org adoption\u2014and helps justify the claim that SB 53 won\u2019t harm \u201cstartups,\u201d who are customers rather than targets. The open question is gross margin and training-capex sustainability as models scale. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news16\ue202turn2news18\ue201\n\n---\n\n## My verdict\n- **Politically adept, mostly consistent.** The stance on a federal standard vs. SB 53 is coherent if you read it as \u201cwe prefer federal rules, but in the interim, a *narrow*, transparency-only state rule that targets just us and our peers is acceptable.\u201d  \n- **Technically careful on bias claims.** Citing third-party studies to argue *relative* neutrality is fair\u2014provided one acknowledges methodological diversity. Anthropic does that (no model is perfectly balanced). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- **One unforced error (DoD misnaming).** Small, but in a high-stakes policy note, it\u2019s the kind of slip that critics will seize on. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- **Competitive upshot:** This is Anthropic carving out a lane as *the* U.S.-aligned, enterprise-safe, disclosure-friendly frontier lab with a uniquely strict PRC policy. Expect pressure on peers to match elements of this posture, particularly around ownership-based service restrictions and transparency artifacts.\n\n---\n\n## What to watch next (falsifiable signals)\n1) **Federal \u201cnational AI standard.\u201d** Does the administration introduce a transparency-and-risk-testing bill that looks like SB 53 for federal scope? If yes, Anthropic\u2019s bet paid off. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news51\ue201  \n2) **Peer policy moves on PRC access.** If OpenAI/Google/xAI adopt ownership-based bans, Anthropic\u2019s claimed uniqueness erodes; if not, its \u201csecurity premium\u201d differentiator strengthens. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news22\ue201  \n3) **ARR trajectory vs. capex curve.** Reuters and others imply ~$7B run-rate now and ~$9B target by year-end; if we don\u2019t see continued step-ups (or if margins compress sharply), the \u201cfastest-growing in history\u201d narrative will meet financial gravity. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news16\ue202turn2news18\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can annotate the original statement line-by-line with fact checks and likely political/economic intent."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news51\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search15\ue201","start_idx":393,"end_idx":452,"safe_urls":["https://apcp.assembly.ca.gov/media/1019?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://billtexts.s3.amazonaws.com/ca/ca-analysishttps-leginfo-legislature-ca-gov-faces-billAnalysisClient-xhtml-bill-id-202520260SB53-ca-analysis-393377.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/b9PMBwQddu9awtmHs/what-sb-53-california-s-new-ai-law-does?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-ceo-says-proposed-10-year-ban-state-ai-regulation-too-blunt-nyt-op-ed-2025-06-05/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-ceo-says-proposed-10-year-ban-state-ai-regulation-too-blunt-nyt-op-ed-2025-06-05/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Anthropic CEO says proposed 10-year ban on state AI regulation 'too blunt' in NYT op-ed","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-ceo-says-proposed-10-year-ban-state-ai-regulation-too-blunt-nyt-op-ed-2025-06-05/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749122856.0,"snippet":"In a New York Times op-ed, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei criticized a Republican-backed proposal to impose a 10-year ban on state-level artificial intelligence regulation, calling it \"too blunt\" for the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

Amodei argued that such a ban would hinder both state action and the development of a cohesive national policy. Instead, he advocated for a federal transparency standard requiring AI developers to disclose testing methods and risk mitigation strategies, especially regarding national security. He emphasized the importance of holding AI companies accountable for ensuring model safety before public deployment.

The moratorium, part of President Donald Trump's tax cut bill, seeks to override recent AI regulations implemented by various states. Amodei argued that such a ban would hinder both state action and the development of a cohesive national policy. Instead, he advocated for a federal transparency standard requiring AI developers to disclose testing methods and risk mitigation strategies, especially regarding national security. He emphasized the importance of holding AI companies accountable for ensuring model safety before public deployment. Amodei noted that Anthropic, along with competitors OpenAI and Google DeepMind, already follow such disclosure practices. However, he stressed that legislative measures may be needed to maintain transparency as AI models grow more powerful and corporate motivations evolve.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"SB 53","url":"https://apcp.assembly.ca.gov/media/1019?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Sep 11, 2025 \u2014 Under the bill, such developers must create, implement, and publish a Frontier AI framework \u2013 documented technical and organizational protocols ...","attribution":"apcp.assembly.ca.gov"},{"title":"What SB 53, California's new AI law, does","url":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/b9PMBwQddu9awtmHs/what-sb-53-california-s-new-ai-law-does?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Sep 29, 2025 \u2014 \u201cLarge frontier developers\u201d are defined as developers of models trained with >10^26 FLOP who also had >$500M in revenue the previous calendar ...","attribution":"forum.effectivealtruism.org"},{"title":"SUMMARY","url":"https://billtexts.s3.amazonaws.com/ca/ca-analysishttps-leginfo-legislature-ca-gov-faces-billAnalysisClient-xhtml-bill-id-202520260SB53-ca-analysis-393377.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Sep 11, 2025 \u2014 As amended September 5th, SB 53 now focuses on models that have a computational threshold of 10^26 floating point operations (or \u201cFLOPs\u201d) but ...","attribution":"billtexts.s3.amazonaws.com"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1news20\ue202turn1news21\ue201","start_idx":2601,"end_idx":2644,"safe_urls":["https://www.anthropic.com/news/updating-restrictions-of-sales-to-unsupported-regions?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ft.com/content/12b8e10b-b55d-4824-817f-a3c9cfe9f779?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/anthropic-blocks-chinese-firms-from-claude?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/updating-restrictions-of-sales-to-unsupported-regions?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Updating restrictions of sales to unsupported regions","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/updating-restrictions-of-sales-to-unsupported-regions?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Sep 4, 2025 \u2014 Anthropic's Terms of Service prohibit use of our services in certain regions due to legal, regulatory, and security risks.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Anthropic to stop selling AI services to majority Chinese-owned groups","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/12b8e10b-b55d-4824-817f-a3c9cfe9f779?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Anthropic, the San Francisco-based developer of Claude AI, has announced it will cease providing AI services to organizations majority-owned by Chinese entities.

developer of Claude AI, has announced it will cease providing AI services to organizations majority-owned by Chinese entities. This unprecedented move among American AI firms aims to prevent China, and other U.S. adversaries like Russia, Iran, and North Korea, from leveraging advanced AI for military or intelligence purposes. The policy applies immediately and encompasses major Chinese firms like ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, as well as indirect access via cloud platforms. The shift aligns with Anthropic's commitment to ensure AI development supports democratic values and U.S. leadership.\n\nThe decision is influenced by growing concerns that Chinese corporations, particularly those setting up offshore subsidiaries in countries like Singapore, might circumvent export restrictions to access U.S. technology. It follows broader U.S. efforts to tighten export controls on AI and hardware, with Anthropic\u2019s CEO previously advocating for stronger regulations. The financial impact is expected to be in the low hundreds of millions of dollars, but the company believes the move is necessary to address national security threats and highlight the risks of unauthorized access, as highlighted by incidents like DeepSeek's alleged misuse of OpenAI models.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Anthropic blocks Chinese-controlled firms from Claude AI - cites 'legal, regulatory, and security risks'","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/anthropic-blocks-chinese-firms-from-claude?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"On September 5, 2025, Anthropic updated its terms of service to ban access to its Claude AI models for any companies majority-owned or controlled by Chinese entities, regardless of their geographic location. This decision applies to all Claude models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and related developer tools. The company cited concerns over legal, regulatory, and security risks, particularly the potential for misuse by adversarial military and intelligence services from authoritarian regimes.\n\nAffected firms include major Chinese tech corporations like ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, as well as their subsidiaries and foreign branches. Although Anthropic acknowledged the policy could result in revenue losses in the low hundreds of millions of dollars, it emphasized the importance of protecting U.S. AI technology.\n\nIn response, Chinese AI startups like Zhipu quickly released migration tools, notably offering a GLM-4.5 API with lower costs and compatibility with Claude workflows. Similarly, Alibaba previously responded to OpenAI\u2019s restrictions with its Qwen-plus model. The block presents a serious challenge for enterprises already using Claude for critical business functions, leaving them to reconsider using local models or adopting multicloud strategies. Anthropic has not yet detailed how it will handle enforcement with global cloud resellers.","attribution":"Tom's Hardware"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Financial Times"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2news16\ue202turn2news18\ue201","start_idx":6722,"end_idx":6752,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-tech-startup-anthropic-unveils-cheaper-model-widen-ais-appeal-2025-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-aims-nearly-triple-annualized-revenue-2026-sources-say-2025-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-aims-nearly-triple-annualized-revenue-2026-sources-say-2025-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Anthropic aims to nearly triple annualized revenue in 2026, sources say","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-aims-nearly-triple-annualized-revenue-2026-sources-say-2025-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1760552308.0,"snippet":"Anthropic, an AI startup, is projecting significant revenue growth by 2026, aiming to more than double or nearly triple its annualized revenue run rate.

Amodei argued that such a ban would hinder both state action and the development of a cohesive national policy. Instead, he advocated for a federal transparency standard requiring AI developers to disclose testing methods and risk mitigation strategies, especially regarding national security. He emphasized the importance of holding AI companies accountable for ensuring model safety before public deployment.

assigns homework: Everyone in military has to watch his anti-woke speech","snippet":"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has mandated that all 2.1 million U.S. military personnel must either watch or read the transcript of a controversial 45-minute speech he delivered on September 30 at Quantico. The speech, targeting \u201cwoke\u201d policies, denounced diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, introduced new physical fitness standards, and warned of a culture shift under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Hegseth emphasized eliminating race- and gender-based promotions and criticized previous military leadership as risk-averse.\n\nReactions to the directive have been mixed. Some former top military officials criticized Hegseth for lacking experience overseeing large organizations, labeling his action as vain or out-of-touch. Others found merit in his emphasis on fitness and clarity of expectations, suggesting the speech could convey important guidance to troops. Still, skeptics viewed the move as more performative than practical, with some service members mocking the mandate.\n\nWhile some senior leaders acknowledged that a unified message from the top could be beneficial, others argued a summary might have sufficed. Hegseth\u2019s critics suggest the speech may also serve personal political ambitions amid speculation of future political roles.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1760983102.0,"attribution":"www.expressnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/14/fox-news-among-broadcasters-refusing-sign-pentagon-press-pledge/","title":"Media including Fox News overwhelmingly reject Pentagon press policy","snippet":"A sweeping rejection of the Defense Department's new press policy occurred by the October 14, 2025 deadline, with Fox News, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and nearly all major media outlets refusing to sign. The contested policy restricts access to non-authorized Defense Department information and revokes press credentials for those unwilling to comply. Critics argue it poses a serious threat to journalistic freedom and violates constitutional protections, while the Pentagon claims it safeguards national security.\n\nThe only major outlet agreeing to the policy is One America News. The rejection includes not only mainstream but also right-wing media, such as Newsmax and the Daily Caller, and many defense-related trade publications. As a result, the Pentagon could, for the first time since its 1943 opening, lose all major media accreditation, severely affecting coverage of the department\u2019s nearly $1 trillion budget.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the rules, backed by President Trump, while media unions and press corps described the policy as vague and damaging. Despite disappointment, journalists expressed resilience, vowing to continue their work under more difficult conditions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1760463060.691,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thedailybeast.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/pentagon-pete-hegseth-mysteriously-loses-another-top-military-officer/","title":"Pentagon Pete Mysteriously Loses Another Top Military Officer","snippet":"Admiral Alvin Holsey, head of U.S. Southern Command, has announced his early retirement effective December 12, 2025, two years ahead of schedule. Holsey, who took the role in November 2024 after serving as deputy commander since 2023, is stepping down after 37 years in the Navy. His sudden departure follows reports of internal tensions with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, particularly regarding escalating military operations in the Caribbean under the Trump administration, including deadly strikes on suspected drug boats near Venezuela.\n\nMultiple sources suggest Holsey was concerned about the direction of operations and may have feared he was about to be fired. While Hegseth's office praised Holsey in an official statement, speculation remains about discord between them. Holsey\u2019s resignation comes amid a wider shakeup in military leadership, with several other top officers either fired or quitting prematurely since Hegseth\u2019s appointment. President Trump recently authorized CIA covert operations in Venezuela, citing drug trafficking and prisoner releases as justification. Meanwhile, Hegseth's restrictive media policies have prompted journalist walkouts from the Pentagon, further contributing to a climate of controversy and unease.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1760666943.0,"attribution":"www.thedailybeast.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.war.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4295826/trump-renames-dod-to-department-of-war/","title":"Trump Renames DOD to Department of War","snippet":"Sep 5, 2025 \u2014 President Donald J.

The Directorate of Defense has been renamed the Directorate of War, with staff now titled as \"directors for war\" and overseen by a \"special assistant to the president for war.\" This shift, confirmed by White House sources, reflects the administration\u2019s emphasis on a more combative \"warrior ethos,\" according to Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who currently also serves as national security adviser, approved the rebrand. The changes raise questions about the impact on policy, especially given Trump's simultaneous advocacy for global peace and his potential candidacy for the Nobel Peace Prize. Critics argue the change could entail significant logistical costs due to updates in signage and communications. Meanwhile, the power of the NSC has diminished under Trump, with significant staff turnover and a shift of influence to the Pentagon, intelligence community, and State Department.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":17},"pub_date":1757761670.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/05/department-war-defense-trump-executive-order-pentagon","title":"Trump signs executive order rebranding Pentagon as ...","snippet":"Sep 5, 2025 \u2014 Congressional approval would ultimately be required for any permanent name change, though the House member Greg Steube from Florida and the ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},"pub_date":1757103913.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/SenatorAngusSKingJr/posts/only-congress-holds-the-authority-to-change-the-name-of-federal-departments-full/1354350542718666/","title":"Only Congress holds the authority to change the name of ...","snippet":"Only Congress holds the authority to change the name of federal departments.

Any *permanent* renaming would require legislation (likely via NDAA or a stand-alone bill). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- Until Congress acts, **contracts, appropriations, litigation captions, and formal statutory references** are still \u201cDepartment of Defense,\u201d even if internal/press materials use \u201cDepartment of War.\u201d (This is why many reports call the EO a rebrand or \u201csecondary title.\u201d) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n## So how should we read Dario Amodei\u2019s phrasing now?\nIn my earlier take, I flagged \u201cDepartment of War\u201d as an error. With the EO in place, **using the term in general discourse is now defensible**. However, **attributing a contract award to the \u201cDepartment of War\u201d is still technically imprecise** unless the award instrument itself was reissued under the new styling; legally, the awarding entity remains DoD until Congress changes the statute. In other words: *stylistically current, legally premature.* \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n## Forward-looking implications\n- **Hill watch:** Members have already floated codifying bills; if they advance, expect months of committee work and statutory ripple effects (titles, seals, FOIA regs, procurement forms, etc.). If they stall, the \u201cWar\u201d label stays mostly a communications layer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- **Procurement & compliance:** Expect **dual usage** for a while (\u201cDepartment of War (Department of Defense)\u201d) in memos and RFPs to avoid ambiguity.

The speech, targeting \u201cwoke\u201d policies, denounced diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, introduced new physical fitness standards, and warned of a culture shift under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Hegseth emphasized eliminating race- and gender-based promotions and criticized previous military leadership as risk-averse.\n\nReactions to the directive have been mixed. Some former top military officials criticized Hegseth for lacking experience overseeing large organizations, labeling his action as vain or out-of-touch. Others found merit in his emphasis on fitness and clarity of expectations, suggesting the speech could convey important guidance to troops. Still, skeptics viewed the move as more performative than practical, with some service members mocking the mandate.\n\nWhile some senior leaders acknowledged that a unified message from the top could be beneficial, others argued a summary might have sufficed.
