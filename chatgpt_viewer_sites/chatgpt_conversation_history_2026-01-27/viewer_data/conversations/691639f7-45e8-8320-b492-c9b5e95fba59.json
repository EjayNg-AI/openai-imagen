This shift began with Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ending the post-1945 and post-Cold War Euro-Atlantic order. The continent's future hinges on the interplay of internal politics and external pressures from a revanchist Russia, an assertive China, and a less supportive United States under Trump\u2019s nationalist influence. The war in Ukraine has exposed Europe's dependence on U.S. military support while highlighting the need for independent strategic capabilities.\n\nInternally, Europe is politically polarized. Nationalist, anti-EU parties draw strength from socioeconomic discontent, aging populations, and immigration fears, while liberal centrists struggle to present compelling alternatives. Upcoming elections in key countries like France, Germany, and Poland may determine whether liberal or anti-liberal forces dominate. Leaders like Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary face rising domestic challenges, while liberal figures must find successors and strategies to win national contests. Europe\u2019s capacity to forge unity, aid Ukraine, and maintain transatlantic ties will shape its role in a changing global order. Ultimately, the continent\u2019s trajectory will be determined by the cumulative outcomes of national political struggles.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1751083215.396,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/15/why-the-franco-german-engine-that-powered-the-eu-is-now-almost-kaput","title":"Why the Franco-German engine that powered the EU is currently kaput","snippet":"The Franco-German alliance, traditionally the engine driving the EU, is facing severe political and economic crises in both countries. France is grappling with its fourth prime minister this year after a government collapse, high public debt, and worsening creditworthiness. Germany, following the collapse of its coalition government last month, faces an election amidst an economic slump. The EU is thus hindered by the instability of its two most influential members. Future administrations in both nations will need to tackle complex economic and structural challenges while navigating political fragmentation. Analysts hold cautious optimism that upcoming elections and reforms could eventually stabilize and revitalize the Franco-German cooperation and the broader EU project, despite the current turmoil and external pressures like the return of America's protectionist policies under Trump\u2019s second term.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1734238835.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/06/us-russia-eu-germany-donald-trump-friedrich-merz-military-economic","title":"The US embrace of Russia is an existential threat to the EU. Germany must step up to save it","snippet":"The article discusses the current geopolitical tension involving the US and Russia, with significant implications for the European Union (EU). The situation is likened to the Yalta conference post-World War II, where great powers decided the fate of smaller nations. Presently, the US and Russia are negotiating Ukraine's future without EU involvement, suggesting Europe is being sidelined. This shift comes amid deteriorating US-Europe relations and the US's new stance, viewing Europe as a primary threat. The article highlights the need for Germany to take a leadership role in strengthening Europe's defense and strategic independence. With Friedrich Merz poised to become Germany's chancellor, he emphasizes the priority of developing an EU defense capability independent of the US. This will require significant financial investment, including potential legislative changes to Germany's debt limitations. The article concludes by emphasizing the urgency for Germany to step up and lead Europe in facing these new security challenges.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1741244421.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69163a0b0538833096f6f3a7a194390b","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Evaluating George Friedman's geopolitical predictions","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"c43e844e-05b9-4610-83d8-5645244ab948","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"b45657c5-fb32-4136-8b57-4646123d2da6","turn_exchange_id":"09d2b95b-c6d1-46f5-9de1-53611e85382b","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b45657c5-fb32-4136-8b57-4646123d2da6","children":["8fd4c0ad-740a-4b83-9a9c-07530704107d"]},"8fd4c0ad-740a-4b83-9a9c-07530704107d":{"id":"8fd4c0ad-740a-4b83-9a9c-07530704107d","message":{"id":"8fd4c0ad-740a-4b83-9a9c-07530704107d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763064342.670812,"update_time":1763064342.68078,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"json","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\":[{\"q\":\"Stratfor decade forecast 2015-2025 assessment how accurate\",\"recency\":365},{\"q\":\"George Friedman track record predictions Russia Ukraine China Europe critique\",\"recency\":365},{\"q\":\"review critique of George Friedman The Next 100 Years accuracy\",\"recency\":730},{\"q\":\"\\\"Storm Before the Calm\\\" review prediction 2020s unrest accuracy\",\"recency\":365}]}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"Stratfor decade forecast 2015-2025 assessment how accurate"},{"type":"search","q":"George Friedman track record predictions Russia Ukraine China Europe critique"},{"type":"search","q":"review critique of George Friedman The Next 100 Years accuracy"},{"type":"search","q":"\"Storm Before the Calm\" review prediction 2020s unrest accuracy"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching for reviews and critiques of George Friedman\u2019s forecasts","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"c43e844e-05b9-4610-83d8-5645244ab948","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"298402e8-6226-4c35-8afd-e2ac99fba2fe","turn_exchange_id":"09d2b95b-c6d1-46f5-9de1-53611e85382b","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"298402e8-6226-4c35-8afd-e2ac99fba2fe","children":["d37040db-04f2-4021-8920-47235fed41c0"]},"d37040db-04f2-4021-8920-47235fed41c0":{"id":"d37040db-04f2-4021-8920-47235fed41c0","message":{"id":"d37040db-04f2-4021-8920-47235fed41c0","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1763064342.7136781,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_model_queries":{"type":"search_model_queries","queries":["Stratfor decade forecast 2015-2025 assessment how accurate","George Friedman track record predictions Russia Ukraine China Europe critique","review critique of George Friedman The Next 100 Years accuracy","\"Storm Before the Calm\" review prediction 2020s unrest accuracy"]},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for reviews and critiques of George Friedman\u2019s forecasts","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"c43e844e-05b9-4610-83d8-5645244ab948","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"8fd4c0ad-740a-4b83-9a9c-07530704107d","turn_exchange_id":"09d2b95b-c6d1-46f5-9de1-53611e85382b","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8fd4c0ad-740a-4b83-9a9c-07530704107d","children":["356b7b17-167f-415f-a36c-2558d00b212b"]},"356b7b17-167f-415f-a36c-2558d00b212b":{"id":"356b7b17-167f-415f-a36c-2558d00b212b","message":{"id":"356b7b17-167f-415f-a36c-2558d00b212b","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1763064342.7118804,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"ipe.ro","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ipe.ro/rjef/rjef1_18/rjef1_2018p167-178.pdf","title":"STRATFOR VS.

The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index rose to 71.8 from October's 70.5, although it fell short of the 73.7 estimate by economists and the preliminary 73.0 reading collected before the election. The sentiment index for Republicans surged by 15.5 points, the largest rise since Trump's 2016 win, while it dropped 10.1 points for Democrats after Vice President Kamala Harris' loss, and declined among political independents. Households expected low inflation in the upcoming year but higher inflation risks over Trump's four-year term, with one-year inflation expectations at 2.6%, down from the previous month, and five-year expectations up to 3.2%. Analysts warn that Trump's policies on tax cuts, tariffs, and immigration might increase inflation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17},"pub_date":1732291464.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/12/biden-clemency-trump-us-politics-updates","title":"Inspector general finds no FBI agents were involved in January 6 attack - as it happened","snippet":"On December 12, 2024, Joe Biden issued a historic batch of clemencies, commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 people and granting 39 pardons. This followed criticism of Biden's decision to pardon his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for tax evasion and gun charges. Meanwhile, president-elect Donald Trump plans to pardon January 6 defendants shortly after taking office and has not ruled out reinstating the family separation policy at the border. An inspector general report cleared FBI agents of involvement in the January 6 attack but criticized the bureau for intelligence shortcomings. Additionally, Trump named Kari Lake, an election denier, to lead Voice of America and visited the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate being named Time's \"person of the year.\" In polls, most Americans disapprove of both Biden's and Trump's controversial pardons.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1734038315.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.vox.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.vox.com/politics/385875/democrats-2004-bush-kerry-trump-harris-2024-election","title":"Democrats got wiped out in 2004.

They subsequently implemented strategies to revitalize the party, including pursuing a 50-state strategy, reevaluating their messaging, and focusing on being a party of ideas. By 2008, these measures helped them achieve a landslide victory with Barack Obama. Fast forward to 2024, Democrats are in a similar situation after losing the popular vote for the first time in two decades. To bounce back, they might revisit the 50-state strategy, improve messaging to counter the modern Republican media, and better connect with the working class. However, history shows that external factors, such as the opposing party's failures, significantly influence the political landscape.

After being disgraced post-2020 election, Trump emerged victorious in the 2024 election, defeating two Democratic opponents and surviving an assassination attempt. His campaign, dubbed \"72 Days of Fury,\" capitalized on national dissatisfaction with the economy, immigration, and cultural issues, resonating across diverse voter demographics. Trump's electoral strategy included adopting a states' rights stance on abortion and embracing early voting, marking notable pivots from his previous positions.\n\nAs President-elect, Trump promises aggressive immigration actions, significant governmental reforms, and a foreign policy rooted in \"America First\" transactionalism. His Cabinet features loyalists and influential figures like Elon Musk, who plans to overhaul government operations. Trump intends to leverage executive power significantly, potentially challenging constitutional norms and sparking widespread changes and disruptions.

The overall urban unemployment rate reached a two-year high of 5.4%. The jobless rate for 25-29-year-olds rose to 7.3%, while the 30-59 age group saw an increase to 4.3%. Previously, the government had stopped reporting youth unemployment data after rates hit a record 21.3% in June 2023 but resumed in December 2023 with modified methodology excluding students. The current unemployment data does not consider rural areas or people who have stopped job searching. In response, China's leaders are focusing on enhancing fiscal and monetary support to boost domestic consumption amid external trade pressures, aiming for an economic growth target of around 5% in 2025. However, reaching this target could be challenging due to issues like weak household demand and a prolonged property crisis.","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10},"pub_date":1742444934.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/china-december-youth-jobless-rate-157-statistics-bureau-says-2025-01-20/","title":"China December youth jobless rate down at 15.7%, statistics bureau says","snippet":"Youth unemployment in Chinese cities decreased for the fourth consecutive month in December, with the jobless rate for 16 to 24-year-olds excluding students dropping to 15.7% from 16.1% in November, as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics. This rate had peaked at 18.8% in August of the previous year. The unemployment rate for 25 to 29-year-olds slightly decreased to 6.6%, while the rate for 30 to 59-year-olds increased to 3.9%. The nationwide jobless rate stood at 5.1% in December. In 2023, China temporarily halted youth unemployment data reporting after a record high rate of 21.3% in June. The statistics bureau resumed publication in December 2023 with revised methodology excluding students. China's economy grew by 5% last year, meeting government targets, though many citizens reported deteriorating living standards. The government has introduced various stimulus measures to support the economy amid expected challenges from Donald Trump's second term as U.S. president. Analysts warn that focusing stimulus on industrial rather than consumer sectors could worsen overcapacity, weaken consumption, and increase deflationary pressures.","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":11},"pub_date":1737364624.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"frontierview.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://frontierview.com/insights/china-real-estate-sector-monitor/","title":"China Real Estate Sector Monitor","snippet":"6 Sept 2024 \u2014 This dynamic is weighing on incomes and driving up youth unemployment.

This optimism is due to recent policy easing and stronger exports. However, the institution warns of ongoing challenges, including a persistent property downturn, weak domestic demand, and potential impacts from rising US tariffs under Donald Trump's presidency. Structural problems like low consumption, high property developer debt, and an ageing population also pose risks. The World Bank stresses the need for deeper reforms, noting that conventional stimulus will be insufficient. Key recommendations include improving social safety nets, boosting quality education and healthcare, and addressing property sector issues. These reforms aim to enhance economic security and foster greater entrepreneurship and risk-taking, particularly among low-income and vulnerable middle-class households. The bank anticipates China\u2019s growth to slow to 4.5% in 2025.","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":12},"pub_date":1735219764.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/17/china-economy-consumer-spending/","title":"China vows to 'vigorously boost consumption' to revive weak economy","snippet":"China has unveiled a 30-point action plan to boost consumer spending and revive its struggling economy amid a prolonged property market slump and the escalating trade war with the United States. The government\u2019s priorities include increasing incomes, stabilizing the stock and property markets, and offering child-care subsidies. Officials urge local governments to expand domestic demand and support low-income populations, while also enhancing access for foreign visitors. However, analysts criticize the plan as vague, suggesting it lacks concrete measures to resolve deeper structural issues like deflation, unemployment, and low household incomes. China is striving to reduce its reliance on exports, but domestic consumer confidence remains weak due to job insecurity and eroded wealth. While industrial output and retail sales have shown modest growth, real estate investment continues to decline. The action plan, backed by top government bodies, also emphasizes improving labor rights and limiting excessive working hours. Despite the optimistic tone, implementation and funding remain uncertain, and experts note that enhancing social services might be more effective in restoring spending confidence. The stock markets responded positively, but skepticism persists about the plan\u2019s potential impact.","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":13},"pub_date":1742202243.132,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.lemonde.fr","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/10/05/beijing-bans-negative-emotions-on-social-media_6746107_4.html","title":"Beijing bans 'negative emotions' on social media","snippet":"In October 2025, Beijing initiated a two-month campaign aimed at purging \"negative emotions\" from social media, under the direction of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). This effort seeks to suppress content deemed pessimistic, divisive, anxiety-inducing, or violent. As part of the crackdown, influential online figures like Professor Zhang Xuefeng were banned from livestreaming for voicing critical opinions about the education system. Social media platforms such as Weibo, Kuaishou, Douyin, and Xiaohongshu are required to monitor and remove such content or face penalties.\n\nThe campaign is occurring amid economic challenges including a real estate crisis and high youth unemployment (18.9% in August), which have contributed to widespread disillusionment among young Chinese. Viral videos depicting educated youth in low-wage jobs have been deleted for \"spreading negative emotions\". Authorities aim to counter trends like \"tang ping\" (lying flat) and \"bai lan\" (let it rot), which reflect youth disaffection and resistance to societal pressure.\n\nThe initiative is part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s broader \u201cChinese Dream\u201d ideology, which seeks to foster a patriotic and optimistic online environment, even at the cost of silencing expressions of social reality or discontent.","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":14},"pub_date":1759652477.0,"attribution":"www.lemonde.fr"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_property_sector_crisis_%282020%E2%80%93present%29","title":"Chinese

This initiative, considered one of the country\u2019s most significant security investments in the past 30 years, involves constructing 300 kilometers of pipelines. The move has gained urgency following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and recent drone incursions. A preliminary deal was signed between the Polish Ministry of Defence and national pipeline operator PERN to begin the planning and construction phases.

Defense Minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz emphasized the project's goal to protect Polish territory, impede adversaries' mobility, and ensure civilian safety. The system will be integrated into the national defense infrastructure and collaborate with defense efforts in the Baltic states, which are also NATO members. The initiative is seen as the most significant reinforcement of NATO\u2019s eastern flank since 1945 and will feature modern monitoring towers, anti-tank barriers, bunkers, and potential minefields. This move comes amid heightened concerns over hostile actions from Russia and Belarus, which include cyberattacks and illegal migrant crossings. The fortifications will contribute to regional security, and the EU's support is also sought due to its broader implications for the bloc's eastern frontier. The announcement coincides with upcoming European Parliament elections, prompting suggestions of its potential role in political campaigning.","ref_id":{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1716794345.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Shield","title":"East Shield","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":22},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eastern_Sentry","title":"Operation Eastern Sentry","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":23},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lublin_Triangle","title":"Lublin Triangle","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":24},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermarium","title":"Intermarium","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":26},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.lemonde.fr","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/05/poland-gives-details-on-eastern-shield-to-be-deployed-on-belarusian-and-russian-borders_6673851_4.html","title":"Poland gives details on Eastern Shield to be deployed on Belarusian and Russian borders","snippet":"On May 27 at the Polish General Staff headquarters, Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz detailed the Eastern Shield, a significant military investment of around 10 billion zlotys (\u20ac2.3 billion) aimed at fortifying Poland\u2019s eastern border and NATO\u2019s eastern flank. Stretching 400-500 kilometers along the borders with Russia and Belarus, the fortifications include reinforced concrete hedges, surveillance towers, bunkers, military warehouses, and bridges, complemented by an advanced detection system and anti-drone mechanisms. This initiative, synchronized with the Baltic defense line, seeks to prevent enemy mobility and enhance Polish and allied security.

This six-month mission, a response to increased Russian strikes near the Polish-Ukrainian border, marks the first deployment of fifth-generation F-35s operating from Poland under direct NATO command. The 24/7 quick reaction alert aims to deter Russian incursions, particularly as attacks near Poland have intensified. The deployment underscores NATO's strategic shift eastward, symbolizing stronger integration among member states and a collective response to Russia's aggression. Experts highlight its significance for Poland, which faces growing airspace threats and has limited air defense resources until it receives its own F-35s in 2026. The mission, involving joint Dutch-Norwegian operations, also provides crucial training and interoperability benefits for Polish forces. Ukrainian leaders view the deployment as vital to reinforcing European security and stress the need for expanded defense coordination to protect regional infrastructure.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government aims to double its annual defense spending to approximately 10 trillion yen ($68 billion) by 2027, positioning Japan as the third-largest military spender globally. The Defense Ministry plans to expedite the deployment of Tomahawk and Type 12 missiles by 2025. In November, the U.S. approved a $2.35 billion sale of 200 Block IV and 200 upgraded Block V Tomahawk missiles. Training for Japanese servicemembers will begin in March. Additionally, Japan has relaxed its restrictions on lethal weapon exports, allowing the sale of Japanese-made and licensed components to allied countries.

Additionally, Japan has relaxed its ban on the export of lethal weapons, allowing the export of items like Patriot missiles to the U.S. These changes align with Japan's new security strategy, which includes the deployment of long-range missiles and collaboration with allies. The defense budget also provides for the development of next-generation fighter jets with Britain and Italy and the early deployment of standoff missiles. Japan's decision to bolster its military capabilities comes amidst increasing regional threats, particularly from China, North Korea, and Russia. Despite financial and demographic challenges, Japan aims to strengthen its defense industry and nearly double its annual military spending by 2027.

US President Donald Trump's remarks on the nonreciprocal nature of the US-Japan security treaty have raised concerns about the United States' commitment to Japan's defense. Experts suggest that bolstered missile systems could strengthen US-Japan ties, despite potential risks of future Japanese debate on acquiring nuclear weapons.

This shift follows increasing regional threats from China and North Korea and is influenced by former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the U.S.-Japan security treaty. Japan aims to boost its military budget to 2% of GDP by 2027, with American officials encouraging an increase to 3.5%. The defense expansion includes investments in missiles, drones, satellites, and the domestic arms industry.

Think \u201cinteresting scaffolding for thinking about power\u201d rather than \u201croadmap\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ll break it into (1) where he was broadly on target and (2) where he\u2019s been clearly off so far.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Where today\u2019s world looks like Friedman\u2019s world\n\n### a. U.S. primacy with partial retrenchment\n\n**What he foresaw**\n\n- In *The Next 100 Years* and the Stratfor 2015\u20132025 decade forecast, he argued the U.S. would remain the dominant economic, political and military power, but become **more selective and cautious** in its foreign engagements as energy self-reliance rose and the Iraq/Afghan experience soured public appetite for intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn9view0\ue202turn1search20\ue201  \n\n**What we see now**\n\n- The U.S. is still the only state with truly global power projection, reserve currency, and top-tier tech/chip capacity.  \n- But it has **pulled back** from regime-change wars, exited Afghanistan, resisted new long ground wars, and under both parties has become more transactional and domestic-focused.\n\nOn this, he\u2019s directionally right: he nailed \u201cstill hegemon, but more hesitant and inward-looking\u201d better than the fashionable \u201cpost-American world\u201d rhetoric of 2010s IR commentary.\n\n---\n\n### b. Russia\u2019s resurgence and the Eastern European front\n\n**What he foresaw**\n\n- He predicted that after the jihadist phase faded, **a new cold-war-like confrontation with Russia** would emerge, driven by Moscow\u2019s attempt to rebuild a sphere of influence in the former USSR and Eastern Europe. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- He expected the U.S. to lean heavily on **Central/Eastern European allies** (Poland, Romania, etc.) to contain Russia \u2013 his \u201cPolish Bloc\u201d idea. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn10search26\ue201  \n\n**What we see now**\n\n- Russia has indeed re-emerged as the **central military threat in Europe**, culminating in the 2014 Crimea annexation and the full-scale 2022 invasion of Ukraine \u2013 the biggest European war since 1945. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search7\ue202turn10search33\ue201  \n- NATO and the EU have shifted their center of gravity east; Poland and the Baltic states are now indispensable to allied strategy, with Poland building one of Europe\u2019s largest armies and fortifying its border (\u201cEast Shield,\u201d record defence budgets, key role in supporting Ukraine). \ue200cite\ue202turn14search3\ue202turn14search4\ue202turn14search6\ue201  \n\nHe didn\u2019t predict the *form* (Crimea 2014 + full invasion 2022) but the **structure** \u2013 Russia as revanchist power; Eastern Europe as the hinge; U.S.\u2013Russia rivalry returning \u2013 is very close to his story.\n\n---\n\n### c. EU fragility, nationalism, and the return of the nation-state\n\n**What he foresaw**\n\n- Stratfor/Friedman repeatedly argued that the **EU\u2019s institutional architecture would come under severe strain**, with national politics reasserting themselves and integration faltering. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search21\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n**What we see now**\n\n- Since 2008, Europe has passed through a rolling sequence of crises \u2013 Eurozone debt, migration, Brexit, rule-of-law fights with Hungary/Poland, and now long-war exposure to Russia \u2013 accompanied by a sustained rise in nationalist and anti-EU parties. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news45\ue202turn0news46\ue201  \n\nHe **overstated** where this would end (see below on \u201cEU collapse\u201d), but he was early and fairly clear that the EU would be **politically brittle**, not a smoothly deepening federation.\n\n---\n\n### d. China\u2019s limits: growth slowdown and authoritarian hardening\n\n**What he foresaw**\n\n- In the mid-2000s he argued that China\u2019s export-led boom had structural limits and would eventually face a **sharp slowdown plus social/political stress**. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n- *The Next 100 Years* originally leaned toward **political fragmentation** as a likely outcome, but the 2015 Stratfor decade forecast quietly revised this toward the more probable path of **renewed strict authoritarian control**, rather than break-up. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search30\ue202turn10search26\ue201  \n\n**What we see now**\n\n- China has not collapsed, but it is clearly in a **much tougher phase**: persistent property slump, slower growth, structural over-capacity, and very high youth unemployment \u2013 with the state responding by tightening censorship and political control rather than liberalising. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search15\ue202turn13news10\ue202turn13news12\ue202turn13news13\ue201  \n\nSo: wrong on *fragmentation* as baseline, but right that \u201cChina is not an unstoppable linear miracle\u201d and that its growth model would hit a wall and produce political tightening rather than Western-style convergence.\n\n---\n\n### e. Middle powers: Turkey, Poland, and (partially) Japan\n\n**What he foresaw**\n\n- A core claim in *The Next 100 Years* is that **Turkey, Poland and Japan** would emerge in the 2020s\u201330s as much more consequential regional powers, initially still U.S.-aligned but increasingly capable of independent action. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search26\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\n**What we see now**\n\n- **Turkey** has clearly upgraded from peripheral NATO player to a **swing regional power** \u2013 projecting force in Syria, Libya and the South Caucasus, balancing between Russia and the West, and trying to shape the post-Gaza order. Even his own team now writes pieces explicitly benchmarking reality against his \u201cTurkey as major Middle East power\u201d forecast. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search21\ue202turn10search8\ue201  \n- **Poland** has moved from EU periphery to **strategic core**: leading on Ukraine, doubling its army, and anchoring NATO\u2019s land defence on the eastern flank. Analysts now talk quite openly about Europe\u2019s geopolitical centre shifting eastwards, with Poland as a central security provider. \ue200cite\ue202turn14search3\ue202turn14search4\ue202turn14search6\ue201  \n- **Japan** is not the aggressive naval hegemon he imagined, but the last 5\u20137 years have seen a genuinely historic break with post-war pacifism: Tokyo is on track to raise defence spending to ~2% of GDP, acquire long-range strike missiles (Tomahawks etc.), and take a much more active regional security role. \ue200cite\ue202turn15search0\ue202turn15search16\ue202turn15news10\ue201  \n\nSo he oversold the *scale* and especially the anti-U.S. twist (see below), but as an early bet that \u201cthe strategic action will move to middle powers on the Eurasian rim,\u201d he\u2019s more right than wrong.\n\n---\n\n### f. A crisis decade for the United States in the 2020s\n\n**What he foresaw**\n\n- In *The Storm Before the Calm* he argued that U.S. history runs in overlapping socioeconomic and institutional cycles; the 2020s would be a **predictable crisis period** of intense political and economic turmoil, peaking toward the late 2020s before a new institutional settlement emerges. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search12\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- He has since explicitly claimed that he anticipated \u201cintense economic and political unrest in the US\u201d this decade. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn10search16\ue201  \n\n**What we see now**\n\n- Whatever one thinks of his cycle theory, the 2020s so far \u2013 pandemic shock, BLM protests, Jan 6th, Trump\u2019s return, repeated government shutdown brinkmanship, culture-war extremism \u2013 certainly look like the kind of **systemic stress** he described.\n\nHe didn\u2019t need cycles to see this coming \u2013 other structural analysts (e.g. Turchin) did so with different tools \u2013 but he was early and quite blunt about \u201cthe 2020s will be ugly for America but not terminal.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2. Where he\u2019s been clearly wrong or very overstated\n\n### a. \u201cEurope is extinct\u201d and EU collapse by 2015\n\nSome of his rhetoric on Europe has simply not aged well.\n\n- Earlier Stratfor decade forecasts (pre-2008) went so far as to suggest the EU project would **\u201cofficially collapse as a political union\u201d by around 2015**, treating 2004 as the start of its unravelling. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n- A review of *The Next 100 Years* summarised some of his more sweeping claims with phrases like \u201cEurope is extinct,\u201d underscoring how little long-term viability he granted EU integration. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\nReality: the EU has been battered but is **still there**, has absorbed Brexit without disintegration, and has mounted unified responses on sanctions against Russia, COVID recovery funds, and Ukraine support. His call on \u201csevere strain and re-nationalisation\u201d was good; the implied near-term **political collapse** was not.\n\n---\n\n### b. Russian and Chinese \u201ccollapse / fragmentation\u201d\n\nIn *The Next 100 Years* he pushes quite hard on the idea that:\n\n- Russia\u2019s federal government would **collapse completely** in the early 2020s under economic and demographic strain, with various regions breaking away. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search30\ue201  \n- China would most likely **fragment**, with the central government losing effective control as regional economic inequalities sharpen. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn10search26\ue201  \n\nNeither has happened, and the structural pressures he did identify have so far produced **more centralisation**, not less:\n\n- Russia is under strain, but has tightened authoritarian control and is waging a long war in Ukraine rather than dissolving.  \n- China is clearly slowing and battling a real-estate bust, but the CCP is still firmly in command and has doubled down on ideological and surveillance control. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search15\ue202turn13search19\ue201  \n\nHis own team partially walked some of this back in the 2015 decade forecast (toward \u201cweakened Russia\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian China\u201d rather than outright break-up), but that just underscores that the original fragmentation bet was overconfident. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search30\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### c. Japan\u2013Turkey alliance and a mid-century world war\n\nFriedman\u2019s most famous \u201cheadline\u201d prediction is a **World War III around 2050**: a surprise space- and missile-heavy conflict between a US-led coalition (with a Polish bloc, India, China restored, etc.) and a Japan\u2013Turkey axis. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search30\ue201  \n\nAs of 2025:\n\n- Japan is more tightly bound to the U.S., Australia and Europe than ever, via defence pacts and reciprocal access agreements. \ue200cite\ue202turn15search16\ue202turn15search17\ue201  \n- Turkey is opportunistic and semi-revisionist, but highly constrained economically and facing Saudi/Emirati competition for regional leadership. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search8\ue202turn1search21\ue201  \n\nCould the world look radically different by 2050? Of course. But the **specific alignment he painted already looks very contrived** given current trajectories. This is one of those places where his scenario-building slides into geopolitical fiction.\n\n---\n\n### d. Underestimating (or mis-timing) key shocks: terrorism, Arab Spring, etc.\n\nThe 2018 academic review \u201cStratfor vs. Reality (1995\u20132025)\u201d goes through multiple decade forecasts and notes:\n\n- The 1995\u20132005 forecast essentially **missed international terrorism as the core driver** of the subsequent 15 years \u2013 9/11, the Iraq/Afghan campaigns, and the \u201cwar on terror\u201d are not central to the scenario. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n- Stratfor also had little to say ahead of time about the **Arab Spring**, the rise and fall of ISIS, and other huge events \u2013 which then had to be retrofitted into their structural narrative. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn10search17\ue201  \n\nTo his credit, Friedman later wrote that he expected no *repeat* of a 9/11-type mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil and gave a decent structural argument for why; that has been correct so far. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \nBut on the **initial salience** of jihadist terrorism and the Arab Spring, Stratfor\u2019s forecasting record is weak.\n\n---\n\n### e. Europe \u201cfailing\u201d vs actually muddling through\n\nEven when his directional intuitions about Europe were right (crises, nationalism, eastward shift), the internal logic is often over-deterministic:\n\n- Stratfor forecasts built up a picture in which the EU\u2019s political experiment is a **fundamental failure**, repeatedly postponing a supposed collapse of the project while treating that collapse as almost inevitable. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\nThe 2018 Romanian study\u2019s conclusion is quite sharp: on the whole, Stratfor is good at **intuiting linear trajectories** (e.g. continued US centrality, Russia as a problem for the West), but major unforeseen events and the repeatedly promised \u201cfalls\u201d of the EU and China are treated as minor timing issues rather than serious falsifications of their model. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn10search17\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### f. US \u201ccycles\u201d as a quasi-deterministic engine\n\n*The Storm Before the Calm* frames U.S. history in overlapping 50-year socio-economic and 80-year institutional cycles. Reviewers have pointed out that:\n\n- The cycles feel **artificial and quasi-Nostradamian** \u2013 they are loose enough that many outcomes can fit, and precise claims like \u201ca new kind of president will emerge in 2024 representing the next era\u201d are not especially rigorous. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search31\ue201  \n\nHe *did* get \u201c2020s turmoil\u201d broadly right, but the **cycle apparatus is not a strong predictive engine**; it\u2019s a narrative device hanging off (more solid) structural observations about demographics, class, and technology.\n\n---\n\n### g. Big gaps: climate, AI, and economic/financial dynamics\n\nA lot of what is shaping the world now lies *outside* Friedman's frame:\n\n- **Climate & decarbonisation**: his work pays relatively little attention to climate politics as a structuring variable in its own right (loss & damage, green industrial policy, new forms of resource rivalry).  \n- **AI and digital platforms**: beyond generic \u201crobotisation\u201d and technology references, his early books have almost nothing to say about AI as a driver of power, productivity, or social disruption.  \n- **Financial system fragility**: he doesn't work much with global financial plumbing (dollar system, shadow banking, sovereign debt) in the way some macro-geopolitical analysts now do.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make his existing claims false, but it limits how far his framework explains *today\u2019s* most novel pressures.\n\n---\n\n## 3. So, \u201chow much\u201d did he really see coming?\n\nIf you strip away the breathless marketing and the space-war scenarios, I\u2019d summarise his track record like this:\n\n- On the **big structural axes** \u2013  \n  - continued U.S. primacy with some retrenchment,  \n  - the return of Russia as primary European problem,  \n  - Eastern Europe\u2019s strategic rise,  \n  - repeated EU crises and nationalist push-back,  \n  - China hitting structural limits and turning inwards,  \n  - the 2020s as a rough decade for the U.S. \u2013  \n\n  he has been **more right than wrong, and often earlier than mainstream commentary**. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue202turn1search21\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n\n- On **timing and end-states** \u2013  \n  - EU \u201ccollapse\u201d by 2015,  \n  - outright fragmentation of Russia and China,  \n  - a mid-century Turkey\u2013Japan axis fighting the U.S.,  \n\n  he\u2019s been **clearly wrong so far**, and in some cases the direction of travel (EU resilience, centralisation in Russia/China, Japan\u2019s alignment with the U.S.) is the opposite of what his more dramatic claims implied. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn10search26\ue202turn15search16\ue201  \n\n- On **coverage**, his model mostly ignores or sidelines phenomena that now look central (climate, AI, the fine structure of global finance), and it handles low-probability shocks (Arab Spring, ISIS, the precise shape of jihadist terrorism) rather poorly. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn10search17\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n\nEven Friedman himself now says *The Next 100 Years* contains \u201cmany forecasts I am proud of and many I regret,\u201d and that timing has been the hardest part. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201\n\nIf you want a blunt verdict:\n\n- **As a structural storyteller**, Friedman is worth reading; he captured several of the core constraints that now dominate geopolitics.  \n- **As a precise forecaster**, his hit rate on the \u201csexy\u201d stuff is not high, and he has a strong tendency to over-dramatise and to keep pushing the same doomsday scenarios until reality eventually produces something that can be framed as confirmation.\n\nPractically, the way to use him now is: **take the logic, not the timelines or the more cinematic details**. Treat his books as worked examples of \u201cif you take geography/demography seriously, here is one coherent future,\u201d not as a scorecard to bet your portfolio or worldview on.\n\nIf you want, we can go issue-by-issue (US\u2013China, Russia/Ukraine, EU\u2019s future, Middle East, AI) and map exactly where his framework still gives you signal and where you should throw it out."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn9view0\ue202turn1search20\ue201","start_idx":893,"end_idx":937,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/united-states-between-isolation-and-empire","https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/united-states-between-isolation-and-empire?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Next 100 Years: A Forecast for the 21st Century","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"The United States: Between Isolation and Empire","url":"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/united-states-between-isolation-and-empire?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"31 Jan 2017 \u2014 In Stratfor's decade forecast for 2015-2025, we predicted two major elements in U.S. behavior moving forward: a partial disengagement from ...","attribution":"Stratfor Worldview"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201","start_idx":1750,"end_idx":1782,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.europeaninstitute.org/index.php/93-european-affairs/february--march-2010/962-george-friedmans-the-next-100-years-a-forecast-for-the-21st-century","https://www.europeaninstitute.org/index.php/93-european-affairs/february--march-2010/962-george-friedmans-the-next-100-years-a-forecast-for-the-21st-century?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Next 100 Years: A Forecast for the 21st Century","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"George Friedman's \u201cThe Next 100 Years - European Institute","url":"https://www.europeaninstitute.org/index.php/93-european-affairs/february--march-2010/962-george-friedmans-the-next-100-years-a-forecast-for-the-21st-century?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Friedman thinks that Russia will present a near term issue as it attempts to regain the sphere of influence of the old Soviet Union.","attribution":"European Institute"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn10search26\ue201","start_idx":1931,"end_idx":1965,"safe_urls":["https://geopoliticalfutures.com/books/the-next-100-years/","https://geopoliticalfutures.com/books/the-next-100-years/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([Geopolitical Futures](https://geopoliticalfutures.com/books/the-next-100-years/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Next 100 Years (published 2009)","url":"https://geopoliticalfutures.com/books/the-next-100-years/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"\u201cEastern Europe will become the most dynamic region of Europe.

The continent's future hinges on the interplay of internal politics and external pressures from a revanchist Russia, an assertive China, and a less supportive United States under Trump\u2019s nationalist influence. The war in Ukraine has exposed Europe's dependence on U.S. military support while highlighting the need for independent strategic capabilities.\n\nInternally, Europe is politically polarized. Nationalist, anti-EU parties draw strength from socioeconomic discontent, aging populations, and immigration fears, while liberal centrists struggle to present compelling alternatives.

This marks the third year of Japan's five-year military buildup strategy initiated in 2022, aimed at countering threats from China, North Korea, and Russia. As part of this strategy, Japan plans to deploy U.S.-made Tomahawk missiles and other long-range arsenals to enhance its strike-back capabilities. The budget allocates significant funds for missile defense, including interceptors and a mobile radar system on Okinawa. Additionally, Japan aims to double its annual military spending to around 10 trillion yen ($63 billion), becoming the world's third-largest military spender. Efforts to strengthen its domestic defense industry include building new multi-purpose destroyers and jointly developing a next-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy.

The Defense Ministry has requested a record \u00a58.8 trillion ($59.9 billion) budget for fiscal 2026, prioritizing long-range missiles and drones.

The exercises, named \"Friendship Sea,\" will be held in the eastern Mediterranean from September 22-26, 2025. Planned military participation includes Turkish frigates, fast attack craft, a submarine, F-16 jets, and Egyptian naval units. Senior naval commanders from both countries are expected to observe the drills on September 25, emphasizing their renewed cooperation.\n\nHistorically, Turkey and Egypt's ties had deteriorated following Egypt\u2019s 2013 military coup, which ousted President Mohammed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2014a group Turkey supported but Egypt later designated a terrorist organization. Additional tensions arose due to conflicting positions on Libya and maritime issues in the eastern Mediterranean. Diplomatic relations began to improve in 2023, when both nations agreed to restore ambassadors and engage in high-level exchanges.

I\u2019ll unpack his reasoning, then go premise-by-premise and ask what still holds in 2025.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Friedman actually argued\n\n### 1.1 The structural setup in *The Next 100 Years*\n\nFrom the book and his Smithsonian interview, the sequence is roughly:\n\n1. **US sea/space hegemony.**  \n   - U.S. remains the sole global power; its navy \u201ccontrols all the oceans\u201d, and this is the foundation of its security. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n   - By mid-century, the *center* of U.S. military power is in **space** (navigation, comms, ISR, weapons platforms). Any challenger must first knock out U.S. satellites. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n2. **Russia and China weaken or fragment.**  \n   - He explicitly forecasts a **collapse of the Russian federal government** in the early 2020s under economic and demographic strain, plus a fragmentation of China into regional blocs or at least a deeply weakened center. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n   - That leaves a chaotic Eurasian heartland into which other powers expand.\n\n3. **Three new great powers on the periphery: Japan, Turkey, Poland.** \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n   - **Turkey**: largest Islamic economy, strongest military in its region, strategically placed at the junction of Europe, the Middle East, the Black Sea and Caucasus. Expected to rebuild a quasi-Ottoman sphere, extending deep into the Arab world and southern Russia. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n   - **Japan**: high-tech, unified, second-largest economy (at the time he wrote), with the largest navy in Asia and total dependence on maritime trade. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n   - **Poland**: leads a \u201cPolish Bloc\u201d in Eastern Europe, becomes a major land power but not a maritime challenger. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n\n4. **US initially backs all three.**  \n   - To contain Russia and manage Eurasia, the U.S. supports Turkey, Japan and Poland as regional counterweights.\n\n5. **Then interests diverge.** \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n   - As Russia collapses and China fragments, Japan and Turkey are no longer useful junior partners but **independent great powers** with their own maritime and space ambitions.  \n   - The U.S. sees their growing navies and space forces as threats to its freedom of action.  \n   - Japan and Turkey see U.S. control of sea-lanes and orbital infrastructure as the main barrier to their full sovereignty.\n\n6. **Why Japan + Turkey specifically?**  \n   In his Smithsonian interview he makes the logic explicit:  \n   - Japan is \u201cutterly dependent on the sea lanes\u201d, which are controlled by the U.S.; as it builds power, it will resent this.  \n   - Turkey likewise wants to be a **maritime power** in the Mediterranean/Black Sea.  \n   - \u201cAs Japan and Turkey become greater maritime powers, the United States will become hostile toward them\u2026 each wants to be a maritime power and each sees the U.S. as a threat. Poland has no interest in being a maritime power\u2026 There\u2019s a natural coalition.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n\n7. **Space as the opening move.**  \n   - Because \u201cthe center of gravity of American military power is in space\u201d, any challenger must start by blinding and crippling U.S. orbital assets. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n   - Hence the famous \u201cspace Pearl Harbor\u201d scenario in 2050: a Turkish\u2013Japanese surprise attack on U.S. and allied satellites and bases, followed by a limited 2\u20133 year war; the U.S. ultimately wins and re-establishes dominance. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n\n8. **Meta-assumption: every century gets its big war.**  \n   - He says bluntly that undermining a power of U.S. magnitude \u201cnormally takes wars and certainly takes generations\u201d and that the 21st century will not be the first without major warfare. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\nUnderneath all the detail, the chain is:\n\n> U.S. maritime/space hegemony  \n> \u2192 Russia/China weaken  \n> \u2192 Turkey & Japan become the only serious maritime challengers on Eurasia\u2019s rim  \n> \u2192 their naval/space build-ups collide with U.S. interests  \n> \u2192 they ally to break U.S. sea/space dominance  \n> \u2192 war.\n\nIt\u2019s very Mackinder + Mahan + \u201cevery century has a war\u201d, with Japan and Turkey cast into the available \u201cchallenger\u201d slots.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How much of that logic holds up in 2025?\n\nLet\u2019s go premise by premise.\n\n### 2.1 U.S. sea dominance and vulnerability in space \u2013 **still broadly true**\n\n- The U.S. Navy remains the only genuinely global naval force; carriers, SSNs, logistics and choke-point control are still central to American power projection. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- Space has indeed become a **critical military domain**: all major powers rely on satellites for ISR, navigation, comms and early warning; every serious military planner now treats space infrastructure as a high-priority wartime target. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n- The U.S., China and Russia have tested or deployed anti-satellite capabilities; both the U.S. Space Force and Chinese/Russian equivalents explicitly plan for space contestation.\n\nSo his intuition that **\u201cif you want to hurt the U.S., you hit its space architecture first\u201d** ages well. Where he looks dated is *who* is most likely to do that (China is the obvious candidate, not Japan/Turkey).\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Russia/China fragmentation creating a vacuum \u2013 **this one is badly wrong**\n\nHe needed Russia and China out of the way to free up the \u201cchallenger\u201d roles for Japan and Turkey:\n\n- He forecast **Russian federal collapse** in the early 2020s, with regions peeling off. Instead we got a weaker but highly aggressive Russian state invading Ukraine and centralising power further. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- He treated **Chinese fragmentation** as the baseline scenario; Stratfor later quietly revised that to \u201crenewed authoritarian centralisation\u201d as more likely. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n\nReality: as of 2025, the central strategic dyad is still **U.S.\u2013China**, with Russia a dangerous spoiler, not a collapsed carcass. That alone massively lowers the plausibility that *Japan* and *Turkey* are the primary anti-US coalition in mid-century.\n\n**Verdict:** this pillar basically doesn\u2019t hold, and it was precisely the pillar that forced him to \u201ccast\u201d Japan and Turkey in roles that now look contrived.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Turkey as a rising regional maritime power \u2013 **partly validated, but constrained**\n\nWhere he was on solid ground:\n\n- Turkey *has* evolved into a much more serious **regional power**:  \n  - Largest economy in its immediate region and a key energy/transit hub. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search22\ue201  \n  - Very capable military by regional standards; NATO\u2019s second largest army.  \n  - Developed its own drone industry (Bayraktar TB2) that\u2019s been combat-proven in Syria, Libya, Nagorno-Karabakh and Ukraine. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search7\ue202turn3search11\ue201  \n  - Pursues the **\u201cBlue Homeland\u201d (Mavi Vatan)** doctrine and is investing heavily in naval capabilities: carrier-like ships, new destroyers, submarines, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3search10\ue201  \n\nOn the other hand:\n\n- Turkey\u2019s ambitions are **bounded by economics** (chronic currency and inflation problems), domestic polarisation and the fact that it still sits inside NATO and relies on Western markets and capital.  \n- It oscillates between confrontation and cooperation with the U.S./EU, but it is not acting like a state preparing to wage a system-level war against the U.S.; it is hedging and leveraging its position for autonomy and regional influence.\n\nSo Friedman\u2019s logic that \u201cTurkey will become a major power on the Mediterranean/Black Sea rim and care a lot about maritime reach\u201d is reasonably on target. The jump to \u201cand therefore it will lead a global anti-US war coalition\u201d is where the wheels come off.\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Japan as assertive maritime challenger \u2013 **rearmament yes, challenger no**\n\nSince 2022, Japan has indeed started to look more like the actor he *thought* it would become \u2013 but *against* China/Russia, not against the U.S.:\n\n- New National Security Strategy; plan to raise defence spending to **2% of GDP by 2027** (essentially doubling it relative to past norms). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn3search8\ue202turn3news40\ue201  \n- Record defence budgets, large buys of U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles and domestic long-range missiles, explicit \u201ccounter-strike\u201d capabilities. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3news45\ue201  \n- Joint next-gen fighter programme with the UK and Italy; deepening security links with Australia, the Philippines, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn4news37\ue201  \n\nSo yes, Japan is **rearming and becoming more militarily serious**, particularly at sea and in the air.\n\nBut crucial differences vs Friedman\u2019s story:\n\n- The driver is explicitly **China + North Korea + Russia**, not hostility to U.S. sea control.  \n- Public opinion and elite strategy still anchor Japan very firmly in the **U.S.-led alliance system**; the whole architecture of its build-up assumes tight U.S. coordination. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn5search0\ue201  \n- Demographically, Japan is one of the world\u2019s oldest and slowest-growing societies; that makes it much less plausible as a globe-spanning hegemon than Friedman\u2019s 2009 lens implied.\n\nSo again, the *micro* logic (\u201cJapan will not remain forever pacifist; it will slowly build serious military capabilities\u201d) is decent. The *macro* claim (\u201cand then it will turn on the U.S. and lead an anti-U.S. maritime coalition\u201d) looks very weak given present trajectories.\n\n---\n\n### 2.5 A Japan\u2013Turkey *axis* against the U.S. \u2013 **almost no support so far**\n\nDo Japan and Turkey have growing ties? Yes, but the nature of those ties actually undercuts Friedman\u2019s narrative:\n\n- Diplomatic relations are long-standing; elevated to a formal **\u201cStrategic Partnership\u201d** in 2013. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search10\ue202turn4search16\ue201  \n- Recently, there\u2019s been visible **defence industry cooperation**:  \n  - Japan\u2019s defence minister visiting Turkey (2025) to discuss buying Turkish drones and broader defence collaboration. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search3\ue202turn4search9\ue202turn4news30\ue202turn4search18\ue201  \n  - Commentators explicitly frame this as **middle powers seeking more autonomy *within* U.S.-anchored alliances**, not as an alternative bloc against the U.S. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search13\ue201  \n\nIn other words:\n\n- There *is* a Japan\u2013Turkey security relationship, but it currently looks like **horizontal networking inside a U.S.-centric system**, not the early stages of a hostile axis.  \n- Both remain **U.S. allies**; both face security problems (China/Russia/Iran/terrorism) where U.S. support is net-positive for them.\n\nCould that change by 2050? In principle yes \u2013 25 years is a long time. But based on what we actually see now, the idea that Japan and Turkey will identify U.S. sea/space hegemony as their *primary* threat and form an overtly anti-U.S. coalition looks extremely low-probability.\n\n---\n\n### 2.6 Space as the opening theatre of a major power war \u2013 **directionally plausible**\n\nHere Friedman is more futurist than forecaster, but the basic argument stands:\n\n- U.S., China, Russia, the EU and India are all building out military space capabilities: ISR constellations, missile warning, jamming, ASAT, on-orbit servicing that can double as offensive capability, etc.  \n- Modern militaries really are **critically dependent** on space for targeting, navigation, communication and C2.\n\nHis vision of \u201cBattle Stars\u201d and lunar bases is over-the-top, but the **principle that any high-end war will involve early attacks on space assets** is now mainstream doctrine. The mismatch is, again, *who* is most likely to contest the U.S. in that domain (China is the obvious A-side).\n\n---\n\n### 2.7 The meta-assumption: a big 21st-century war is structurally inevitable\n\nThis is more philosophy than prediction:\n\n- He assumes long-run hegemony shifts are **resolved by wars**, not by peaceful diffusion of power.  \n- He also has a strong narrative preference for \u201cevery century gets a big one\u201d.\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t make that a law of nature. You can certainly construct plausible 21st-century war scenarios (U.S.\u2013China over Taiwan, India\u2013China escalation, NATO\u2013Russia accident, etc.), but there\u2019s no hard structural reason those conflicts must look like his **Japan\u2013Turkey space-Pearl-Harbor story**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Net assessment\n\nIf you boil his Japan\u2013Turkey axis logic down to core claims and score them as of 2025:\n\n1. **U.S. sea and space dominance will be the key constraint on challengers.**  \n   \u2714 Largely correct and still relevant.\n\n2. **Middle powers on the rim of Eurasia (Japan, Turkey, Poland) will grow in relative importance.**  \n   \u2714 Broadly right; you now see abundant commentary on \u201cmiddle power coalitions\u201d and the rise of states like Poland and Turkey. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n\n3. **Turkey will build serious maritime and defence capability and seek greater regional autonomy.**  \n   \u2714 Largely true, though economic and political constraints bite. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search10\ue202turn3search11\ue201  \n\n4. **Japan will rearm and behave more like a normal great power.**  \n   \u2714 True in the rearmament sense, but its alignments are moving *toward* Washington, not away from it. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3news40\ue202turn3news45\ue201  \n\n5. **Russia and China will fragment, leaving Eurasia\u2019s center weak.**  \n   \u2718 Strongly falsified so far; both remain central to the global system, with China now the primary long-term challenger to U.S. power. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn13search15\ue201  \n\n6. **Japan and Turkey will see the U.S. as their main long-term threat and form a hostile axis.**  \n   \u2718 No real evidence.

The budget allocates significant funds for missile defense, including interceptors and a mobile radar system on Okinawa. Additionally, Japan aims to double its annual military spending to around 10 trillion yen ($63 billion), becoming the world's third-largest military spender.

This marks the third year of Japan's five-year military buildup strategy initiated in 2022, aimed at countering threats from China, North Korea, and Russia. As part of this strategy, Japan plans to deploy U.S.-made Tomahawk missiles and other long-range arsenals to enhance its strike-back capabilities. The budget allocates significant funds for missile defense, including interceptors and a mobile radar system on Okinawa. Additionally, Japan aims to double its annual military spending to around 10 trillion yen ($63 billion), becoming the world's third-largest military spender. Efforts to strengthen its domestic defense industry include building new multi-purpose destroyers and jointly developing a next-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy. Japan also seeks to enhance its warship capabilities and improve servicemember recruitment and retention through better salaries and working conditions.","attribution":"AP News"},{"title":"Japan accelerates missile deployment amid rising regional tensions","url":"https://apnews.com/article/e9257a74ab740fb5c98c3acfb810fdf3?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Japan is expediting its deployment of domestically developed long-range missiles amid rising tensions in the region.

This acceleration aligns with Japan\u2019s strategic move to bolster its strike-back capabilities, especially in response to China\u2019s assertive naval actions, North Korea\u2019s threats, and concerns about Russia.\n\nBreaking from its post-WWII pacifist stance, Japan had already shifted defense policies in 2022, adopting a five-year strategy identifying China as a primary threat and strengthening ties with the U.S. As part of this military buildup, Japan aims to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2027. The Defense Ministry has requested a record \u00a58.8 trillion ($59.9 billion) budget for fiscal 2026, prioritizing long-range missiles and drones. Alongside the Type-12 missiles, Japan will also deploy U.S.-made Tomahawk missiles and seek to enhance coastal defense with unmanned aerial, surface, and underwater drones to address military understaffing due to its aging population.","attribution":"AP News"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"RUSI"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn13search15\ue201","start_idx":14008,"end_idx":14053,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coming_War_with_Japan","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coming_War_with_Japan?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Next 100 Years: A Forecast for the 21st Century - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_100_Years%3A_A_Forecast_for_the_21st_Century","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"The Coming War with Japan","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coming_War_with_Japan?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search13\ue202turn4news30\ue202turn4news37\ue201","start_idx":14325,"end_idx":14369,"safe_urls":["https://politicstoday.org/strategic-complementarity-linking-ankara-and-tokyo/","https://politicstoday.org/strategic-complementarity-linking-ankara-and-tokyo/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-defence-minister-says-discuss-chinas-actions-with-japan-counterpart-2025-02-24/","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-defence-minister-says-discuss-chinas-actions-with-japan-counterpart-2025-02-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/japans-defence-minister-visits-turkey-talks-defence-cooperation-drones-2025-08-19/","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/japans-defence-minister-visits-turkey-talks-defence-cooperation-drones-2025-08-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Politics Today](https://politicstoday.org/strategic-complementarity-linking-ankara-and-tokyo/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"'Strategic Complementarity' Linking Ankara and Tokyo","url":"https://politicstoday.org/strategic-complementarity-linking-ankara-and-tokyo/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1761811741.0,"snippet":"30 Oct 2025 \u2014 The defense partnership between Turkey and Japan may exemplify middle powers seeking greater autonomy within existing alliances.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Japan's defence minister visits Turkey for talks on defence cooperation, drones","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/japans-defence-minister-visits-turkey-talks-defence-cooperation-drones-2025-08-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani is visiting Turkey as part of a regional tour from August 17-22, which also includes Djibouti and Jordan.
