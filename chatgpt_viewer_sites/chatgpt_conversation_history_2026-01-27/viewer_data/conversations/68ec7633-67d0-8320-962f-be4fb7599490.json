In standard models, inflation is placed at around 10^-36 seconds, but this depends on the model. The timing is derived by matching the inflaton potential energy with the CMB anisotropy amplitude, then converted using H^2 \u2248 V/(3M_p^2).

This constrains *how late inflation can end*, not when it began. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## What we cannot determine (and why)\n\n- The formal \u201c\\(t=0\\)\u201d of the FRW extrapolation is a *classical* singularity; quantum gravity is expected to modify it. In *any* case, cosmic time is only well-defined once a classical, almost-FRW patch exists. So \u201ctime from \\(t=0\\)\u201d isn\u2019t an observable.  \n- Inflation also has a **cosmic no-hair** property: a period of accelerated expansion rapidly erases memory of pre-inflation curvature/inhomogeneity, so the CMB carries almost no imprint of what happened *before* the inflating phase we observe. (Rigorous versions and refinements exist beyond Wald\u2019s original argument.) \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7search2\ue201\n\n- There is also a **past-incompleteness theorem**: any spacetime with positive average Hubble parameter along past-directed geodesics is past-incomplete\u2014pure inflation can\u2019t be extended indefinitely into the past; something non-inflationary must precede it (a bounce, an emergent/static phase, a tunneling/no-boundary origin, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Could inflation be \u201cdelayed\u201d after a very long quasi-equilibrium?\n\n**Yes in principle, but non-trivially.** The best-studied versions are **emergent-universe** scenarios: the universe sits for arbitrarily long proper time in an (approximately) Einstein-static state (\\(H\\approx0\\)) and then transitions into slow-roll inflation. This can evade the Borde\u2013Guth\u2013Vilenkin past-incompleteness condition because the average \\(H\\) to the past needn\u2019t be positive. However:\n\n- **Dynamics & stability.** An Einstein-static universe in GR with \u201cnormal\u201d matter is at best neutrally stable to some perturbations and unstable to others (e.g., homogeneous anisotropic/Bianchi modes); achieving long-lived metastability typically needs positive spatial curvature (\\(k=+1\\)) and special matter content or modified gravity. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search5\ue201\n\n- **Building explicit models.** Concrete emergent-universe models exist (closed FRW, tuned scalar potentials, or extensions of GR) that then roll into standard inflation and reheat, but the construction is delicate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn4search1\ue201\n\n- **Consistency with observations.** Present data are consistent with a spatially **flat** universe at the \\(\\sim\\!10^{-3}\\) level when Planck is combined with BAO, which disfavors any *present* strong positive curvature; still, inflation would dilute earlier curvature, so the early-time requirement of \\(k=+1\\) for stability is not directly excluded. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search10\ue201\n\n- **Initial-conditions/naturalness.** Even with a long pre-inflation plateau, you don\u2019t automatically solve the homogeneity/isotropy problem; numerical and analytic work has emphasized that inflation often requires special initial conditions to begin (a tuned, sufficiently smooth patch or specific potentials). That criticism applies *a fortiori* to models that must hover near an unstable equilibrium for a very long time. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search6\ue201\n\n**Alternatives that realize a long prelude without \u201cwaiting in place.\u201d**  \nBounce/cyclic (ekpyrotic) models replace the pre-inflation phase by a long, ultra-slow contraction with \\(w\\gg1\\), smoothing the universe before a bounce; some variants then transition into inflation, others don\u2019t. They are viable at the level of broad constraints but rely on nontrivial microphysics for the nonsingular bounce. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search14\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Two numbers that people quote (and what they *really* mean)\n\n- \u201cInflation at \\(t\\sim10^{-36}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\).\u201d  \nDerived by taking the CMB-allowed \\(H_*\\) (see above) and \\(N\\sim50\\text{\u2013}60\\): \\(\\Delta t \\sim N/H_*\\sim10^{-36}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\). It is the **duration of the last stage of inflation**, not the age since a fundamental beginning. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue202turn8search3\ue201\n\n- \u201cReheating before \\(t\\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{s}\\).\u201d  \nA restatement of the BBN requirement \\(T_{\\rm re}\\gtrsim\\) few MeV; again, this constrains the **end** of inflation, not the beginning. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- There is **no observational handle** on the absolute interval from a putative \\(t=0\\) to the start of inflation. What we *can* infer is the Hubble scale and e-fold budget of the last observable part of inflation. Those imply a characteristic timescale \\(H_*^{-1}\\sim10^{-38}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\) and a duration for the last \\(\\sim50\\)\u2013\\(60\\) e-folds of order \\(10^{-36}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\), *but they say nothing about any earlier epoch*. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue202turn8search3\ue201\n\n- A **very long pre-inflation epoch** is **not ruled out** and can be modeled (e.g., emergent/Einstein-static scenarios), but it requires non-generic dynamics to be long-lived and to hand off to slow-roll inflation cleanly. It also doesn\u2019t leave clear observable traces because inflation \u201cforgets\u201d its past (no-hair), and pure inflation cannot be past-eternal anyway (BGV). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can sketch a minimal emergent-universe toy model (closed FRW + scalar field) and show which parameters control (i) metastability time near the static point and (ii) the eventual slow-roll window compatible with \\(n_s\\) and the \\(r\\) bound."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue202turn6search12\ue202turn8search3\ue201","start_idx":1050,"end_idx":1096,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06209?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07961?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/03/aa39585-20/aa39585-20.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06209?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Planck 2018 results.
