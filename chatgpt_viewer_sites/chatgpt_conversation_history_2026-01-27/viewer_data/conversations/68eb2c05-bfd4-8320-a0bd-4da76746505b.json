Here\u2019s a curated, no-nonsense set organized by purpose. All are rigorous on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\); several extend cleanly to metric/normed spaces. I note when a book stays pre-measure (Riemann/Jordan/Darboux/differential forms) vs. when it brings in Lebesgue.\n\n# Core, pre-measure multivariable on Euclidean space\n- **Munkres \u2014 *Analysis on Manifolds*** (terse, very clean).  \n  Differential calculus on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), differential forms, full Stokes, change of variables via forms. Little on metric spaces, but an ideal \u201cEuclidean rigorous\u201d spine.\n\n- **Spivak \u2014 *Calculus on Manifolds*** (even terser).  \n  Beautiful line-by-line proofs of multivariable calculus and Stokes via forms. Best paired with a friendlier text for exercises/details.\n\n- **Folland \u2014 *Advanced Calculus*** (broad, modern).  \n  Multivariable differential calculus, contractions, inverse/implicit function theorems, differential forms & Stokes. Some metric-space/normed-space framing; integration is largely pre-Lebesgue.\n\n- **Fitzpatrick \u2014 *Advanced Calculus*** (rigorous with more scaffolding).  \n  Covers metric/normed spaces early, then differentiation on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), multiple Riemann integrals, differential forms, and a careful Stokes. Bridges nicely to measure if you decide to cross that line.\n\n- **Apostol \u2014 *Calculus, Vol. II*** (linear-algebra-aware, many exercises).  \n  Vector calculus done from first principles; multiple Riemann integrals, Fubini/Tonelli under Riemann conditions, line/surface integrals, Green\u2013Gauss\u2013Stokes. Minimal metric-space theory.\n\n- **Hubbard & Hubbard \u2014 *Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms* (Unified Approach)** (very readable, proof-based).  \n  Differential forms from the start, change of variables done cleanly, many geometric examples. Remains pre-Lebesgue while still being rigorous.\n\n- **Loomis & Sternberg \u2014 *Advanced Calculus*** (free, high level).  \n  Linear-algebraic approach, differential forms, Stokes; integration developed rigorously without leaning on full measure theory. Demands mathematical maturity.\n\n# Multivariable analysis with a metric-space backbone (still mostly pre-measure)\n- **Rudin \u2014 *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*** (\u201cBaby Rudin\u201d).  \n  Metric spaces, uniform convergence, differentiation on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), inverse/implicit function theorems. Integration is Riemann-(Stieltjes); no Lebesgue here.\n\n- **Pugh \u2014 *Real Mathematical Analysis*** (conceptual clarity).  \n  Metric spaces, contraction mappings, smooth multivariable calculus, change of variables, Sard\u2019s theorem (light). Integration is Riemann; nudges toward measure but doesn\u2019t depend on it.\n\n- **Tao \u2014 *Analysis I* and *Analysis II***  \n  I: metric spaces done carefully; II: multivariable calculus and multiple Riemann integrals with a modern proof style. Lebesgue is kept separate (see Tao\u2019s measure text below).\n\n- **Lang \u2014 *Analysis II* (or *Undergraduate Analysis*)**  \n  Algebraic style; differentiability in normed spaces, differential forms, Stokes. Pre-Lebesgue but abstract where it helps.\n\n- **Kolmogorov & Fomin \u2014 *Introductory Real Analysis***  \n  Compact development of metric and normed spaces, differentiation on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\); later chapters gesture toward measure, but it\u2019s not prerequisite for the multivariable core.\n\n- **Sutherland \u2014 *Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces*** / **O\u2019 Searcoid \u2014 *Metric Spaces***  \n  If you want a stricter metric-space foundation before (or in parallel with) multivariable calculus.\n\n# If/when you welcome measure & integration (extensions)\n- **Apostol \u2014 *Mathematical Analysis*** (the blue book).  \n  Starts from metric spaces; includes a clean introduction to outer measure/Lebesgue measure and the Lebesgue integral on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Excellent \u201cone-volume bridge\u201d from pre-measure to measure-aware multivariable analysis.\n\n- **Folland \u2014 *Real Analysis*** (measure first).  \n  Full modern Lebesgue theory on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), product measures, Fubini/Tonelli, change of variables in its natural measure-theoretic setting. Ideal once you want the real statements behind multiple integration.\n\n- **Royden & Fitzpatrick \u2014 *Real Analysis*** (classic route).  \n  Lebesgue measure/integration, \\(L^p\\), differentiation theorems\u2014pairs well after a pre-measure multivariable course.\n\n- **Tao \u2014 *An Introduction to Measure Theory*** (freely available draft online).  \n  Lean, proof-forward entry to Lebesgue integration and product measures, with excellent exercises.\n\n- **Wheeden & Zygmund \u2014 *Measure and Integral*** (concise, functional-analytic slant).  \n  Good if you want to move quickly toward analysis on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) with applications.\n\n# What to pick (minimal, high-yield paths)\n\n**Path A (stay pre-measure, Euclidean-first, then optional measure):**  \n1) **Fitzpatrick *Advanced Calculus*** *or* **Folland *Advanced Calculus*** as the core.  \n2) Pair with **Sutherland** (or **O\u2019 Searcoid**) for metric spaces as needed.  \n3) For a clean Stokes/Change-of-Variables proof: add **Munkres** *or* **Loomis\u2013Sternberg**.  \n4) If you later want measure: **Apostol (blue)** \u2192 **Folland (Real Analysis)**.\n\n**Path B (metric-space spine with multivariable add-on):**  \n1) **Rudin PMA** (metric spaces + core multivariable theorems).  \n2) Add **Hubbard & Hubbard** (or **Apostol Vol. II**) for forms, geometry, and lots of exercises.  \n3) Optional measure: **Tao (Measure)** or **Royden\u2013Fitzpatrick**.\n\n**Path C (fast to differential forms with good pedagogy):**  \n1) **Hubbard & Hubbard** as the main text.  \n2) Use **Pugh** or **Tao Analysis I** for metric-space technique.  \n3) Optional measure: **Apostol (blue)** \u2192 **Folland (Real Analysis)**.\n\n# Topic coverage matrix (at a glance)\n\n- **Metric/normed spaces as a framework:** Rudin PMA, Pugh, Tao I, Fitzpatrick AC, Folland AC, Lang Analysis II, Kolmogorov\u2013Fomin.  \n- **Inverse/Implicit/Rank theorems (rigorous):** Rudin PMA, Folland AC, Fitzpatrick AC, Lang Analysis II, Munkres, Loomis\u2013Sternberg.  \n- **Differential forms & Stokes (clean proofs):** Spivak CoM, Munkres, Hubbard & Hubbard, Loomis\u2013Sternberg, Folland/Fitzpatrick AC.  \n- **Multiple Riemann integrals & change of variables (pre-measure):** Apostol Vol. II, Munkres, Spivak CoM, Hubbard & Hubbard, Folland/Fitzpatrick AC.  \n- **Lebesgue measure/integration (when you want it):** Apostol (blue), Folland RA, Royden\u2013Fitzpatrick, Tao (Measure).  \n- **Fubini/Tonelli in full generality:** Measure texts above (not the pre-measure ones).\n\n# A quick critique of \u201cpre-measure only\u201d\nYou can do a lot rigorously (inverse/implicit, Stokes via forms, change of variables) without Lebesgue. But the first time you want general product-integration, dominated convergence without technical contortions, or a complete statement/proof of Fubini/Tonelli beyond nicely bounded Riemann-integrable functions, you\u2019ll save time by stepping into Lebesgue. If you want to delay that, pick a forms-centric text (Munkres/Spivak/Hubbard) plus a metric-space text (Rudin/Pugh/Tao I) and you\u2019ll still cover 95% of multivariable \u201ccalculus on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\)\u201d rigorously.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me your preferred proof style (ultra-terse vs. pedagogical), I\u2019ll narrow this to 3\u20134 titles and a problem set plan."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"98d3cac33e51ce0a-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"431f9da0-9647-405b-9ee0-336a9477ea8c","turn_exchange_id":"a8fdb189-31b3-4dba-8f6e-874d64edf01d","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"431f9da0-9647-405b-9ee0-336a9477ea8c","children":["222f854f-ee01-4cd0-b5be-4f2ec13ac6e0"]},"222f854f-ee01-4cd0-b5be-4f2ec13ac6e0":{"id":"222f854f-ee01-4cd0-b5be-4f2ec13ac6e0","message":{"id":"222f854f-ee01-4cd0-b5be-4f2ec13ac6e0","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760244488.699,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Using this mainly as a comprehensive background to build upon for advanced distribution theory, functional analysis, differential geometry and manifolds"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"98d3f69e19a3ce5d-SIN","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"00e361df-cfb5-4db4-87ce-0536c1bc895e","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"407e3b1b-a7ce-4369-91ac-1b9c29637f33","children":["bd608421-d3d1-4c12-8eb2-c39b844eec6a"]},"bd608421-d3d1-4c12-8eb2-c39b844eec6a":{"id":"bd608421-d3d1-4c12-8eb2-c39b844eec6a","message":{"id":"bd608421-d3d1-4c12-8eb2-c39b844eec6a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760244493.570628,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Building a study plan","content":"The user is tackling advanced topics like distribution theory, functional analysis, differential geometry, and manifolds.

Here\u2019s a tight, no-fluff plan.\n\n# Minimal 6-book core (high-leverage, fast track)\n1) **Hubbard & Hubbard \u2014 *Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms*** (latest ed.).  \n   Your Euclidean workhorse: rigorous differential calculus, forms, Stokes, clean change-of-variables. Enough geometry to make the manifold leap painless.\n\n2) **Rudin \u2014 *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* (PMA).**  \n   Metric spaces, uniform convergence, differentiability on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), inverse/implicit function theorems. Terse but priceless for habits you need in FA and distributions.\n\n3) **Apostol \u2014 *Mathematical Analysis* (the \u201cblue\u201d book)** *or* **Tao \u2014 *Introduction to Measure Theory*.**  \n   Do one, not both. This is your efficient Lebesgue entry: outer measure, Lebesgue integral, \\(L^p\\), product measures, Fubini/Tonelli. Apostol is a single-volume bridge; Tao is lean and modern.\n\n4) **Brezis \u2014 *Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and PDE*.**  \n   Best single-volume gateway to distributions in the wild: Banach/Hilbert basics, weak derivatives, Sobolev spaces, Lax\u2013Milgram, variational methods. Very direct path from analysis to PDE/distributions.\n\n5) **Strichartz \u2014 *A Guide to Distribution Theory and Fourier Transforms*.**  \n   Conceptual and usable: tempered distributions, Schwartz space, convolution, Fourier transform, standard operations. After Brezis, this clicks quickly.\n\n6) **Lee \u2014 *Introduction to Smooth Manifolds* (ISM).**  \n   Charts/atlases, tangents, tensors, differential forms, partitions of unity, integration on manifolds, de Rham cohomology. Natural continuation of the H&H forms viewpoint.\n\n> Outcome: With these six, you\u2019ll be distribution-ready (tempered, Sobolev), FA-literate (Banach/Hilbert, duality, compactness), and geometry-fluent (forms, Stokes, de Rham).  \n\n---\n\n# Strategic substitutes / add-ons (use only if you prefer a different tone)\n\n## Multivariable & forms (Euclidean focus)\n- **Munkres \u2014 *Analysis on Manifolds*** or **Spivak \u2014 *Calculus on Manifolds***: ultra-terse forms-first derivation of Stokes; great if you like spare proofs.  \n- **Loomis & Sternberg \u2014 *Advanced Calculus*** (free): high level; change of variables and forms done cleanly.\n\n## Metric/normed spaces baseline\n- **Pugh \u2014 *Real Mathematical Analysis***: more conversational than Rudin, still rigorous.  \n- **Lang \u2014 *Undergraduate Analysis* / *Analysis II***: algebraic style; good for normed-space differentiation.\n\n## Measure/integration (deeper or reference)\n- **Folland \u2014 *Real Analysis***: canonical graduate-level measure/Lp/product measures; use as reference or if you want more generality.  \n- **Stein & Shakarchi \u2014 *Real Analysis* + *Fourier Analysis***: crisp development; Fourier volume is a friendly bridge to tempered distributions.\n\n## Functional analysis (different flavors)\n- **Lax \u2014 *Functional Analysis***: operator-theoretic, concise; complements Brezis.  \n- **Rudin \u2014 *Functional Analysis***: abstract, elegant; less PDE/distribution-pragmatic than Brezis.  \n- **Reed & Simon I \u2014 *Functional Analysis***: spectral theory with physics instincts; good for operators encountered with distributions.\n\n## Distributions & Fourier (beyond Strichartz)\n- **Friedlander & Joshi \u2014 *Introduction to the Theory of Distributions***: brief, classical route.  \n- **Tr\u00e8ves \u2014 *Topological Vector Spaces, Distributions and Kernels***: when you need the TVS machinery behind Schwartz distributions.  \n- **H\u00f6rmander I \u2014 *The Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators I***: the gold standard once basics are internalized.\n\n## Manifolds & DG (after Lee-ISM)\n- **Lee \u2014 *Riemannian Manifolds* (IRM)**: Levi-Civita, geodesics, curvature\u2014clean and modern.  \n- **Tu \u2014 *An Introduction to Manifolds*** (friendlier on-ramp) and **Bott & Tu \u2014 *Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology*** (de Rham \u2192 cohomology).  \n- **Guillemin & Pollack \u2014 *Differential Topology***: transversality, degree, Sard; pairs well with distributions when you care about regularity vs. genericity.\n\n---\n\n# Why \u201cpre-measure only\u201d won\u2019t quite suffice (and how to keep it minimal)\nFor distribution theory you need, at minimum:\n- **Lebesgue \\(L^p\\)** (completeness, duality \\( (L^p)^*=L^q \\) for \\(1<p<\\infty\\)),  \n- **Modes of convergence** (a.e., in measure, in \\(L^p\\), weak),  \n- **Product measures & Fubini/Tonelli** (to justify iterated integrals and kernels),  \n- **Fourier transform on \\(L^1\\) and \\(L^2\\)** (Plancherel),  \n- **Sobolev spaces** \\(W^{k,p}\\) and weak derivatives (distributional derivatives live here).\n\nYou can keep the measure detour short: do Apostol-blue (or Tao-Measure) chapters on outer measure, Lebesgue integral, \\(L^p\\), product measures, DCT/Fatou/Egorov, then jump to Brezis.\n\n---\n\n# Concrete 20-week plan (self-study, focused)\n**Phase 1 (Weeks 1\u20136): Euclidean rigor + metric spine**  \n- H&H Ch. 1\u20138 (multivar calculus, forms, Stokes).  \n- Rudin PMA Ch. 2\u20134 (metric spaces, sequences/series), Ch. 7\u20139 (multivariable diff., inverse/implicit).\n\n**Phase 2 (Weeks 7\u201310): Minimal Lebesgue**  \n- Apostol-blue Ch. on outer measure, measurable sets, Lebesgue integral, \\(L^p\\), product measures; or Tao-Measure Ch. 1\u20133, 6\u20138.  \n- Do exercises establishing DCT, MCT, Fubini/Tonelli, density of \\(C_c^\\infty\\).\n\n**Phase 3 (Weeks 11\u201315): FA core + Sobolev**  \n- Brezis: Banach/Hilbert prelims, Riesz rep., weak convergence, Sobolev spaces (Poincar\u00e9, Rellich\u2013Kondrachov), Lax\u2013Milgram.  \n- Optional: Stein\u2013Shakarchi *Fourier Analysis* (Plancherel, convolution).\n\n**Phase 4 (Weeks 16\u201318): Distributions**  \n- Strichartz cover-to-cover (tempered distributions, Fourier, operations, examples).  \n- Work classic identities: \\(\\widehat{\\partial^\\alpha f}=(2\\pi i\\xi)^\\alpha \\hat f\\), principal value kernels.\n\n**Phase 5 (Weeks 19\u201320): Manifolds**  \n- Lee-ISM: charts, partitions of unity, pullback/pushforward of forms, integration on manifolds, Stokes on manifolds.  \n- (If time) Lee-IRM Ch. 1\u20134 for geodesics/curvature basics.\n\n---\n\n# Capstone theorems/skills to master (for your stated goals)\n- **Inverse/Implicit/Rank Theorems** in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) (Rudin/H&H).  \n- **Stokes via differential forms** and **Change of Variables** (H&H/Munkres/Lee-ISM).  \n- **Dominated convergence, Fubini/Tonelli, product measures** (Apostol/Tao/Folland).  \n- **Riesz representation (Hilbert), Hahn\u2013Banach, Banach\u2013Steinhaus, Open Mapping/Closed Graph** (Brezis/Lax).  \n- **Sobolev spaces & weak derivatives**, trace/embedding theorems, **Lax\u2013Milgram** (Brezis).  \n- **Tempered distributions**: Schwartz space, Fourier transform, convolution with test functions, principal values (Strichartz).  \n- **Partitions of unity** and **integration on manifolds**, **de Rham cohomology** (Lee-ISM/Bott\u2013Tu).\n\n---\n\n# If you want an even denser route\n- Replace H&H + Rudin PMA with **Loomis\u2013Sternberg** (for forms/change-of-variables) + **Pugh** (for metric-space intuition).  \n- Replace Apostol/Tao with **Stein\u2013Shakarchi (Real Analysis)** if you like brisk exposition and many worked Fourier-ready examples.  \n- If you plan to go deep on microlocal/PDE: after Strichartz, add **H\u00f6rmander I**.\n\nIf you tell me which exposition style you prefer (terse vs. discursive, exercise-heavy vs. theorem-proof), I\u2019ll lock this to a final 3\u20134 book stack and an exercise list that hits the exact lemmas you\u2019ll reuse in
