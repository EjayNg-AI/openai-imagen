This principle is often referred to as the \"no-signaling theorem.\"\n\n### No-Signaling Theorem\n\nThe no-signaling theorem states that quantum entanglement, despite its non-local correlations, cannot be used to transmit information instantaneously. Here's a high-level outline of why this is the case:\n\n1. **Entanglement and Measurement:**\n   When two particles are entangled, the measurement of one particle instantaneously affects the state of the other, no matter the distance between them. However, this does not allow for the transmission of usable information faster than light.\n\n2. **Random Outcomes:**\n   The results of quantum measurements are inherently probabilistic. When one observer measures their part of an entangled pair, the outcome is random. Although the entangled partner will correlate with this outcome, an observer at the other location cannot control or predict this measurement outcome to send a specific message.\n\n3. **Local Hidden Variables:**\n   If we assume local hidden variables (as discussed in Bell's theorem), the outcomes of measurements on entangled particles are pre-determined but unknown to the observers. The correlations observed do not imply faster-than-light communication because no information is transmitted; the correlations are revealed only after comparing measurement results through classical communication, which is limited by the speed of light.\n\n### Bell's Theorem and Experimental Tests\n\nBell's theorem shows that no local hidden variable theories can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics, implying that quantum mechanics inherently involves non-local effects. However, these non-local effects do not violate the no-signaling theorem because:\n\n- The measurement results on one side cannot be influenced or predetermined to send a message to the other side.\n- Any attempt to use entanglement for communication would require comparing classical information (e.g., measurement settings and outcomes), which cannot occur faster than the speed of light.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while quantum entanglement allows for instant correlations between distant particles, it does not enable faster-than-light communication. This is ensured by the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements and the requirement for classical communication to compare measurement results."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"7f33b76c-202b-4e49-8e01-db45aad4e3f5","request_id":"89b625d02e173e48-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7f33b76c-202b-4e49-8e01-db45aad4e3f5","children":[]}}}
