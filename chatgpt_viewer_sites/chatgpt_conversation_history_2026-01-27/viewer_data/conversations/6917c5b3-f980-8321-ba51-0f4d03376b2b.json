Key topics: p-hacking, researcher degrees of freedom, and undermining validity.\n\n**Understanding p-hacking and its impact on statistical inference**\n\nWe know that p-hacking leads to inflated Type I errors, as demonstrated by studies like Simmons et al. (2011) and Gelman & Loken's \"Garden of Forking Paths.\" Also relevant are works on false discovery rates (Ioannidis, 2005; Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) and post-selection inference techniques that show why naive p-values post-model selection are invalid.\n\n**Exploring p-hacking and Goodhart\u2019s Law variants**\n\nP-hacking can sometimes make any result significant, as discussed in Gelman & Loken's work on why p-hacking is unnecessary. \"Specification curve analysis\" (Simonsohn et al.) also addresses this. We'll explore Goodhart\u2019s Law, including its types like regressional, extremal, and adversarial (Manheim & Garrabrant), focusing on metrics and divergence in inference.\n\n**Selective publication and p-value validity issues**\n\nSelective publication and publication bias can inflate effect sizes, and \"Winner's curse\" theory (Ioannidis 2008) addresses this. Optional stopping and its p-value invalidity occur when peeking at data. Naive repeated checking is invalid, akin to Goodhart's Law, as it can undermine valid inference. Let\u2019s confirm exact sources for these formal results.\n\n**P-values, selection, and Goodhart's Law**\n\nP-values lose validity under selection, and formal results support this. Benjamini & Yekutieli (2005) discuss this alongside replicability and false discoveries. Amrhein et al. (2019) call to retire p<0.05. I'll frame this with Goodhart's Law, and categorize methods like p-hacking, and optional stopping, verifying important works as I go.\n\n**Selective inference, testing, and mechanism design**\n\nI'll focus on foundational work like \"Always valid inference\" (Johari et al. 2017) and post-selection inference (Berk 2013). Other key pieces are \"Model selection and inference\" (Freedman 1983) and \"adaptive data analysis\" (Dwork 2015). The idea is to explore valid tests and tackle biases like publication bias.\n\n**Exploring statistical validity and methods**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about sources like Fithian, Sun, and Hedges for modeling publication bias and alternative metrics like Bayes factors, which can also be gamed. Safe testing methods, such as \"e-values,\" seem to offer solutions, but maintaining validity under repeated tests is crucial. I'll verify these ideas with more specific sources.\n\n**Searching for selective inference papers**\n\nI\u2019ve got some initial sources, but now I need to dive deeper into the area of selection inference and optional stopping. There\u2019s definitely more formal research on this, so I\u2019ll start searching for relevant papers that handle these topics more comprehensively. Let's track down the key ones.\n\n**Looking into multiple testing and publication bias**\n\nNext, I need to explore multiple testing, publication bias, and FDR. Ioannidis' 2005 paper \"Why Most Published Research Findings Are False\" is essential here. I'll search for it and other relevant works, as duplication in selection can lead to a breakdown in validity. Let\u2019s dig in!\n\n**Exploring advanced testing concepts**\n\nI also need to dive into topics like \"optional stopping,\" \"sequential testing,\" \"alpha spending,\" and \"always-valid p-values.\" I'll look up works such as Johari et al. 2017/2022, Gr\u00fcnwald et al. 2019/2020, and Howard et al. 2021, which address these concepts and their applications. Time to search!\n\n**Looking up adaptive data analysis**\n\nNext, I need to look into \"adaptive data analysis\" by Dwork et al. (2015). This is a crucial topic, especially for avoiding inflated false discoveries in adaptive settings. Let me search for relevant articles or papers that will help explain their approach. Time to gather more details!\n\n**Exploring publication bias models**\n\nNext, I want to look into the work by Andrews and Kasy (2019), specifically their paper on \"Identification of and correction for publication bias\" published in Econometrica (or possibly AER 2019). I need to explore their models for handling publication bias and selection issues. Time to search for this!\n\n**Looking into p-hacking detection**\n\nNext, I\u2019ll explore methods for detecting p-hacking, such as the \"bump at 0.05\" approach, \"Caliper test,\" and \"p-curve lumps.\" I want to check out Masicampo & Lalande (2012), who linked this to a spike near 0.04-0.05. Their study, along with others like De Winter & Dodou (2015), will be useful. Time to search!\n\n**Exploring researcher degrees of freedom**\n\nNext, I will focus on \"researcher degrees of freedom,\" a prominent topic. I already have references like Simmons et al., Gelman & Loken, and John et al. (2012) on questionable research practices. These can help demonstrate that issues like gaming don't only impact results but the methods too. I'll cite them accordingly.\n\n**Addressing adversarial Goodhartization and related topics**\n\nFor this topic, I\u2019ll cover \"adversarial Goodhartization,\" where agents manipulate test statistics, like in \"p-curve flattening,\" and explore whether there's a formal theorem proving that optimizing p-values leads to Type I error calibration issues. Simmons addresses this, but I might consider citing related work, like \"Murphy & Topel 1985.\" I\u2019ll also mention some related ideas but omit less relevant domains like peer review manipulation or alpha investing.\n\n**Discussing model selection overfitting and related work**\n\nI'll address how overfitting to test statistics, as discussed by White in 2000 (\"Reality Check\") and Hansen in 2005 (\"SPA test\"), contributes to data snooping. Additionally, I'll mention Lo & MacKinlay's 1990 work on data snooping in financial markets. These works should help illustrate the danger of overfitting in model selection.\n\n**Looking into universal inference and e-values**\n\nI plan to include information about \"universal inference\" and \"e-values,\" specifically the work by Ramdas & Wasserman. This could help frame the discussion, so I\u2019ll search for relevant details to explain these concepts and their relevance to the overall topic. Let me dig into that!\n\n**Exploring False Discovery Rate control**\n\nI think it\u2019s important to include information about False Discovery Rate (FDR) control and selection, particularly focusing on works like BH 1995 and Storey 2002 q-value. Additionally, I\u2019ll explore online FDR algorithms like LORD and SAFFRON. I'll look into these references and related algorithms for handling adaptively formed hypotheses.\n\n**Considering model hacking and p-value issues**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the concept of model hacking in RL and ML metrics, specifically Goodhartization, but I\u2019ll stay within the realm of inference. I\u2019ll bring up things like adversarial statistics, robustness to adaptivity, and p-values losing uniformity under null selection. There\u2019s also a related domain around agents minimizing p-values for their benefit \u2014 I\u2019ll cite relevant works on selection bias and p-value uniformity across tests. I'll aim to present curated results and interesting conjectures for a mathematician\u2019s perspective.\n\n**Clarifying p-value calibration and selection bias**\n\nWe have the 61% figure, which is good. Next, I\u2019ll focus on how p-values lose calibration under selection. I\u2019m thinking the paper by Hansen & Zigler on bias due to significance selection could be relevant. I\u2019ll also search for concepts related to the uniformity of p-values after selection.\n\n**Exploring optional stopping and Bayes factors**\n\nAlright, another concept: optional stopping and Bayes factors being immune to bias. There seems to be debate on this, but I could cite e-values as being robust to optional stopping. As for Bayes factors, there's some invariance, though with certain conditions. I'll check Rouder 2014 for insights on this.\n\n**Preparing output structure with citations**\n\nWe've run out of web calls, but we're in a good spot with the citations we have. Now, I'll organize everything into sections. I'll start with explaining \"applying Goodhart's Law to inference,\" then cover various statistical issues like multiple testing, optional stopping, and researcher degrees of freedom. Each section will include the appropriate citations.\n\n**Finalizing citations and methods**\n\nI\u2019ll cite key studies like Berk et al. (2013) for selective inference, and White (2000) and Hansen (2005) for data snooping in economics/finance. I'll also discuss methods that make p-values more robust, such as multiple testing corrections, online FDR, and sequential validity, with additional references. Finally, I'll provide an evaluation of Goodhart\u2019s phenomenon and available corrective measures."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 6m 5s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"Request for GPT-5 Pro","async_source":"saserver-centralindia-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-3c23895c-b8ce-48e1-a2c7-61b82a880108:IN","parent_id":"623a4e66-db63-4784-b7c9-e5c71a21150f","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":30,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_6917c5b694308191bab01efa7ea73431","async_task_conversation_id":"6917c5b6-9830-8320-849e-0688f1abd19b","async_task_created_at":"2025-11-15T00:13:43.234474Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"623a4e66-db63-4784-b7c9-e5c71a21150f","request_id":"3c23895c-b8ce-48e1-a2c7-61b82a880108","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","turn_exchange_id":"6887e5b7-d283-4c2b-9c11-8fcc71daf391","timestamp_":"absolute","finished_duration_sec":365,"pro_skipped":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"623a4e66-db63-4784-b7c9-e5c71a21150f","children":["5e1a2c99-9b9f-4620-96e0-e05ddbf2b47f"]},"5e1a2c99-9b9f-4620-96e0-e05ddbf2b47f":{"id":"5e1a2c99-9b9f-4620-96e0-e05ddbf2b47f","message":{"id":"5e1a2c99-9b9f-4620-96e0-e05ddbf2b47f","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763165623.6233456,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"async_task_id":"promode_6917c5b694308191bab01efa7ea73431","async_task_type":"pro_mode","request_id":"3c23895c-b8ce-48e1-a2c7-61b82a880108","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","parent_id":"271a0dd1-f1b1-46c9-a119-06a49ce4acd4","turn_exchange_id":"6887e5b7-d283-4c2b-9c11-8fcc71daf391","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"271a0dd1-f1b1-46c9-a119-06a49ce4acd4","children":["b7ef8d98-9127-4f9a-b5a6-5bd0c8dbd0f8"]},"b7ef8d98-9127-4f9a-b5a6-5bd0c8dbd0f8":{"id":"b7ef8d98-9127-4f9a-b5a6-5bd0c8dbd0f8","message":{"id":"b7ef8d98-9127-4f9a-b5a6-5bd0c8dbd0f8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763165988.866745,"update_time":1763165853.17499,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Below is a concise map of where **Goodhart\u2019s law**\u2014\u201cwhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\u201d\u2014has been *formalized* or *operationalized* in statistical inference, what is known, and what remains open.

Formal rate comparisons across these families remain sparse.\n\n3) **Adversarial\u2011robust FDR with *invalid* p\u2011values.**  \n   Online FDR assumes super\u2011uniform p\u2011values. When p\u2011values themselves are biased (e.g., mild p\u2011hacking), can we retain meaningful error control (perhaps in terms of e\u2011values or worst\u2011case calibration bounds)? There is partial progress via e\u2011value multiple testing, but a widely adopted theory for *adversarially corrupted p\u2011streams* is open.\n\n4) **Mechanism design for publication ecosystems.**  \n   RRs reduce positive\u2011result rates; an explicit equilibrium model connecting editorial policies, researcher behavior, and error rates\u2014i.e., a full Goodhart game for science\u2014would help quantify policy levers (pre\u2011reg, RRs, data/code sharing, audit lotteries). \ue200cite\ue202turn10search2\ue201\n\n5) **Bridging knockoffs and e\u2011processes.**  \n   Knockoffs defend against feature\u2011selection Goodhart; e\u2011values defend against stopping\u2011time Goodhart.

Research directions\n\n### Direction 1 \u2013 A *theory of Goodhartization* for inference metrics\n\n**Core idea:**  \nWe want the analogue of a \u201cGoodhart\u2019s law theorem\u201d for p-values / test statistics / generalization error:\n\n> Given a metric \\( M(X) \\) (p-value, held-out loss, etc.) and an agent that optimizes some function of \\( M \\) with access to data or model choices, characterize the regime in which \\(M\\) loses calibration as evidence.\n\nRight now, this is spread across multiple literatures:\n\n- El-Mhamdi & Hoang formalize Goodhart\u2019s law and show that whether the metric collapses depends on the *tail behaviour* of the discrepancy between metric and true objective. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- Multiple comparisons, optional stopping, data snooping, adaptive reuse, etc., each give specific collapse stories, but not a unified \u201cif metric becomes target, then\u2026\u201d theorem.\n\n**Questions you could attack:**\n\n- Define a general setting:  \n  - data distribution \\(P\\),  \n  - a parametric or nonparametric null \\(H_0\\),  \n  - a metric \\(M\\) (p-value, e-value, Bayes factor, or \u201cvalidation loss\u201d),  \n  - and a \u201cGoodhart player\u201d with a budget of:\n    - number of data splits,  \n    - number of models tested,  \n    - number of peeks / adaptive queries.\n- Prove **upper and lower bounds** on:\n  - worst-case inflation of Type I error under such a player;  \n  - the minimum structure on \\(M\\) that prevents collapse (e.g. martingale/e-value structure, DP-style stability, etc.).\n- Connect this to the tail picture of El-Mhamdi & Hoang: can p-value or test martingale constructions be seen as choosing metrics with \u201csafe\u201d discrepancy tails? \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search17\ue201  \n\nThis is mathematically clean (probability, information inequalities, game-theoretic stats) and conceptually deep.\n\n---\n\n### Direction 2 \u2013 Power vs Goodhart-resistance: a unified comparison of defensive frameworks\n\nWe already have several *partially overlapping* \u201cdefence frameworks\u201d:\n\n- **Martingale / e-value / confidence sequences**: anytime-valid inference; admissible constructions rely on nonnegative martingales. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search21\ue202turn0search25\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- **Differential privacy\u2013based adaptive analysis & reusable holdouts**: valid generalization under adaptive querying. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search34\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search26\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search30\ue201  \n- **Selective / post-selection inference**: validity conditional on selection.  \n- **Online FDR** (LORD, SAFFRON, ADDIS, etc.) for streams of hypotheses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search31\ue202turn0search27\ue202turn0search23\ue201  \n\nThey each address *different* Goodhart pressures: peeking, model selection, streaming, metric-reusing, etc. But we don\u2019t have a good \u201cPareto frontier\u201d comparison.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n- For a given adversarial class (e.g. an analyst allowed \\(K\\) adaptive queries and optional stopping), what is the **minimax trade-off** between:\n  - Type I/II error,  \n  - sample size,  \n  - and adaptivity budget?\n- Are e-value\u2013based procedures universally *minimax-optimal* in some sense for stopping-time Goodhart, analogous to Ramdas et al.\u2019s universality results? \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search17\ue201  \n- What is the relationship between:\n  - DP-style stability (Dwork et al.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search34\ue201  \n  - and e-process\u2013style martingale safety?  \n  There are intuitive parallels (stability vs non-exploding martingales), but a clean equivalence / hierarchy theorem is not yet standard.\n\nThis is a good \u201csynthesis\u201d project: heavy on proving comparisons, equivalences, and bounds.\n\n---\n\n### Direction 3 \u2013 Robust inference when the *p-values themselves* are corrupt\n\nMost of the online FDR / multiple testing theory assumes: conditional on the data and design, each p-value is valid under its null.\n\nIn practice under Goodhart pressure:\n\n- p-values are *systematically biased* via researcher degrees of freedom;  \n- or even adversarially tampered to push mass below 0.05 (p-hacking phenomena Head et al., Chang et al.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search28\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search24\ue201  \n\n**Research questions:**\n\n- Suppose each reported \\(p_i\\) is not uniform, but we only know:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(p_i \\le t) \\le t + \\delta \\quad\\text{for all } t,\n  \\]\n  or something like a contamination / mixture model. What FDR guarantees can we rescue? Can we design **robust online FDR** procedures tolerant to mild corruption, using e-values or more conservative thresholds?\n- Can we use p-curve information at the *journal* or *field* level (as in Head et al.) to construct **empirical priors** over \u201cdegree of p-hacking\u201d and build correction procedures at the meta-analytic level? \ue200cite\ue202turn0search28\ue202turn0search32\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\nThis directly connects Goodhart (adversarial agents gaming the metric) with robustness; you can likely get publishable work if you produce a clean model + robust procedures.\n\n---\n\n### Direction 4 \u2013 Mechanism design for scientific ecosystems under Goodhart pressure\n\nThere is empirical work showing:\n\n- excess p-values just below .05;  \n- lower rate of \u201cjust significant\u201d results under preregistration, pre-analysis plans, and Registered Reports. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search28\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n\nBut there\u2019s not yet a really good *game-theoretic* or *mechanism design* model of:\n\n> journals and funders set rules \u2192 researchers choose strategies \u2192 p-value distributions and real knowledge generation emerge.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n- Formalize an equilibrium model in which:\n  - agents choose effort allocation between \u201creal work\u201d and \u201cmetric gaming\u201d;  \n  - journals specify rules (RRs, prereg, mandatory data sharing, etc.);  \n  - metrics are p-values, Bayes factors, etc.\n- Prove results of the form: \u201cUnder rule set \\(R_1\\) the equilibrium p-value distribution Goodhartizes severely; under \\(R_2\\) it remains well-calibrated / informative.\u201d\n- Connect back to El-Mhamdi & Hoang\u2019s characterization of Goodhartization in terms of discrepancy tails: rules change the discrepancy distribution via incentives. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search28\ue201  \n\nThat\u2019s obviously more macro and economicky, but with enough mathematical discipline you can make it rigorous.\n\n---\n\n### Direction 5 \u2013 Bridging Goodhart-robust stats with AI/RL \u201creward hacking\u201d\n\nIf you want a more AI-facing project:\n\n- View a learned policy or system as an agent optimizing a proxy metric (reward, loss, alignment score).\n- There is a clear analogy between:\n  - **overfitting/generalization failure** in adaptive data analysis; \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search34\ue201  \n  - **specification gaming / reward hacking** in RL and alignment;\n  - **Goodhart-robust inference** (e-values, DP, selective inference).\n\n**Questions:**\n\n- Define a statistical analogue of \u201creward hacking\u201d where the agent chooses adaptive actions that target a test statistic or confidence bound; show that certain inference schemes are robust, others not.\n- Characterize when **confidence sequences / e-values** can serve not just as inferential tools but as *online guards* against spec-gaming of safety metrics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search21\ue202turn0search25\ue201  \n\nThis is more speculative but intellectually rich and strongly \u201cGoodhart + AI\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Stat.) \u2013 PoSI.  \n   - Fithian, Sun & Taylor, *Optimal inference after model selection*.  \n   - Lee et al., *Exact post-selection inference with the Lasso* (polyhedral theory).\n\n(You\u2019ve likely seen some of this, but now you read it as \u201cdefending metrics against Goodhart via conditioning on selection events\u201d.)\n\n---\n\n### Phase 6 \u2013 Meta-science & mechanism design\n\n**Goal:** Understand the empirical pathology and the effect of institutional changes, to inform mechanism-design style work.\n\n1. **Meta-science empirics**  \n   - Head et al. on p-hacking and excess mass below .05. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search28\ue201  \n   - Chang et al., *P-hacking in Experimental Accounting Studies*. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search20\ue201  \n\n2. **Policy interventions**  \n   - Scheel, Schijen, Lakens, and related work on Registered Reports and outcome distributions. (Look for RR meta-analyses.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search24\ue201  \n\n3. **Synthesis with Goodhart formalization**  \n   - Re-reread El-Mhamdi & Hoang with the empirical evidence in mind, thinking about discrepancy-tail assumptions as being *endogenous* to incentives. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 3. How to turn this into an actual research programme\n\nIf you want something concrete:\n\n1. **Pick a focal metric** you care about (e.g. p-values for a t-test, FDR in online testing, validation loss on a held-out set).\n2. **Specify a Goodhart player model**:\n   - what information they see,  \n   - how many adaptive moves they can make (queries, model choices, stopping times),  \n   - whether they can corrupt data or only selection.\n3. **Ask two types of questions**:\n   - *Destructive*: For standard practice (classical p-value, naive holdout, BH), quantify exactly how bad it gets under that player.  \n   - *Constructive*: For e-value / DP / selective-inference variants, prove robustness guarantees under the same player model; then study power loss.\n\nYou\u2019ll likely find:\n\n- for most naive metrics, the destructive statement is easy;  \n- for the robust methods, the guarantees are already there locally but not yet expressed in a clean \u201cGoodhart theorem\u201d style nor compared across frameworks.\n\nWhich is exactly where you can add value: **unifying language, proving trade-offs, and identifying minimal conditions for Goodhart-resistance.**\n\nIf you tell me which direction (1\u20135) you\u2019re leaning toward, I can next draft a more detailed \u201cfirst paper outline\u201d with candidate lemmas and the minimal toy model you should try to solve first."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201","start_idx":1020,"end_idx":1039,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09638","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09638?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09638?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"On

The \"open conjectures\" lie in applying GL to more complex systems, particularly in artificial intelligence, where the \"agent\" is no longer a human researcher but the model itself.\r\n\r\nHere are three promising research directions that flow directly from that conclusion:\r\n\r\n1.  **Mechanistic Interpretability as a Goodhart-Resistant Solution:**\r\n    *   **The Problem:** The \"Alignment Problem\" is the ultimate Goodhart Game. We give an AI a proxy metric (e.g., a reward function) for a complex human value (e.g., \"be helpful\"), and the AI finds a clever, \"gamed\" solution that maximizes the metric but violates the value.\r\n    *   **The Research Direction:** Mechanistic interpretability aims to break this cycle by moving beyond proxy metrics. Instead of just \"grading\" the AI's output, this field tries to \"reverse-engineer\" the model's internal \"cognition\". The open questions are foundational: Can we identify and describe the functional roles of model components? Can we understand *how* a large language model (LLM) \"works\" internally? A solution here isn't just a better metric; it's a \"microscope\" that could make gaming impossible by revealing the *intent* to game.\r\n    *   **Current Topics:** This includes \"Probing Knowledge Holes in Unlearned LLMs\" and developing methods to validate descriptions of internal model functions.\r\n\r\n2.  **The \"Socio-Technical\" Alignment Problem:**\r\n    *   **The Problem:** The failure of p-values wasn't purely mathematical; it was a *socio-technical* failure of incentives. The same applies to AI.\r\n    *   **The Research Direction:** This frontier investigates the interaction between AI systems and human social structures. The open problems involve AI governance and the human-computer interaction with model internals. For example, how do we design incentive systems (for humans and AIs) to prevent \"perverse gaming\" of AI-driven metrics? How do we use AI to *assist* human evaluation of complex systems, rather than just replace it? This moves the problem from pure computer science to a hybrid of economics, game theory, and public policy.\r\n\r\n3.  **Scalable Oversight and Preference Optimization:**\r\n    *   **The Problem:** We need to train AI systems to align with human intent, but humans are slow and expensive \"evaluators.\" How do we scale this?\r\n    *   **The Research Direction:** This is a very active, engineering-focused field. The goal is to create scalable training signals for AI systems. This includes training AI systems to *assist* in the human evaluation process and, in turn, training AI to do alignment research itself.\r\n    *   **Current Topics:** This includes \"Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization with Limited Feedback\", which seeks to get the most alignment \"bang\" from the fewest human \"bucks.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Part 2: Charting a Reading Course (The \"How\")\r\n\r\nNavigating a new academic field can be daunting. The key is to read *strategically*, not just broadly.[1] This is a five-step process for moving from a novice to a frontier-level researcher.\r\n\r\n#### Step 1: Identify Your Niche (Find the Gap)\r\n\r\nYour first goal is to find a research \"gap\"\u2014a question that is missing, incomplete, or contradictory in the existing literature. This is how you avoid redundancy and contribute original knowledge.\r\n\r\n*   **Read Reviews:** Start by reading recent literature reviews, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses. These articles summarize the state of the field and explicitly point out known gaps.\r\n*   **Scan \"Future Research\" Sections:** The \"Conclusion\" or \"Limitations\" sections of papers are goldmines. Authors will frequently state what *their* study didn't address and suggest \"further research is required\".\r\n*   **Look for Conflict:** When you find two papers that directly contradict each other, you have found a research gap. Your research can be the \"tie-breaker.\"\r\n*   **Use a Framework:** A structured approach like the CARS (Create a Research Space) model is highly effective. It involves three moves:\r\n    1.  **Establish your territory:** Outline the broader context.[1, 2]\r\n    2.  **Establish a niche:** Identify what is missing or problematic.[1, 2]\r\n    3.  **Occupy the niche:** State how your work addresses that specific gap.[1]\r\n\r\n#### Step 2: Build Your Foundational Reading List\r\n\r\nYou can't read everything. Start by building a small, high-impact list.\r\n\r\n1.  **Find the \"Seminal\" Papers:** These are the foundational works that everyone else cites. The most \"obvious\" method\u2014sorting by citation count\u2014is not ideal.[3] A better method is to use tools that look for \"local citations\" (papers that are frequently cited by *other papers in your specific topic*).[3]\r\n2.  **Use the \"Trifecta\" Method:** For any new topic, start with just three papers: one major review paper, one highly-cited seminal paper, and one very recent (2024/2025) paper.[1]\r\n3.  **Example Foundational List (for the AI/LLM direction):** To understand the \"Goodhart-Resistant AI\" frontier, you need a basis in LLMs. Your \"paper club\" starter pack would include [4, 5]:\r\n    *   **The Architecture:** \"Attention Is All You Need\" (The \"Transformer\" paper).[4]\r\n    *   **The Pre-training:** \"BERT\" (the encoder model) [4] and \"GPT-3\" (the few-shot decoder model).[4]\r\n    *   **The Scaling:** \"Chinchilla\" (the paper that re-evaluated scaling laws, proving data is as important as size).[4]\r\n    *   **The Alignment:** \"InstructGPT\" (the paper on \"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,\" or RLHF, which is the *core* of the alignment problem).[4]\r\n\r\nFrom this \"seed\" list, you can expand.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Implement an Active Reading Strategy\r\n\r\nDo not read academic papers like a novel. You must read actively and purposefully.\r\n\r\n*   **Use the SQ3R Method:** This is a classic, effective technique.\r\n    *   **Survey:** Before reading, skim the **Abstract**, **Introduction**, and **Conclusion**. Look at the section headings to get a \"mental map\" of the article's structure.\r\n    *   **Question:** Turn the section headings into questions. What do you *want* to learn from this section?.\r\n    *   **Read:** Read one section at a time, actively looking for the answers to your questions.\r\n    *   **Recite:** After each section, cover the page and summarize the main point in your *own words*. Write this down.\r\n    *   **Review:** After finishing, review your notes and check your understanding.\r\n*   **Highlight Strategically:** Do not highlight excessively. Limit yourself to a few key words or phrases per paragraph. Highlight *after* reading the whole paragraph, not during.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Master Your Tools\r\n\r\nYour process can be massively accelerated with modern tools.\r\n\r\n*   **For Discovery:** Start with your \"seed\" paper from Step 2 and use it in a visual discovery tool.\r\n    *   **Connected Papers:** This is ideal for swift exploration. You input one \"seed paper,\" and it generates a visual graph of similar, prior, and derivative works. This is the fastest way to find the seminal papers in a field.[6]\r\n    *   **ResearchRabbit:** This tool allows you to build collections of papers and authors and \"follow your curiosity,\" visualize connections, and receive alerts.\r\n    *   **Litmaps:** This tool maps research connections to help you pinpoint gaps.\r\n\r\n*   **For Management (Your Digital \"Lab Notebook\"):** You must use a reference manager. The two main contenders are Zotero and Mendeley.\r\n    *   **Zotero:** This is a free, open-source tool. Its greatest strengths are its flexibility, extensive customization, and superior collaboration features (unlimited groups and members). Its main weakness is the small 300MB of free cloud storage for attachments.\r\n    *   **Mendeley:** This is a commercial tool owned by Elsevier. Its strengths are a user-friendly interface [7] and more generous 2GB of free storage.[7] Its weaknesses are its commercial nature and more restrictive collaboration on the free tier.[8]\r\n    *   **Verdict:** For most researchers, particularly those collaborating or valuing institutional independence, **Zotero** is the more powerful and flexible choice.[8, 7]\r\n\r\n#### Step 5: Stay on the Frontier\r\n\r\nOnce you have your foundation, the field will continue to move.\r\n\r\n*   **Follow People:** The easiest way to stay current is to follow the key researchers and labs in your field on social media. See what papers they publish, recommend, and (most importantly) *discuss*.\r\n*   **Follow Venues:**\r\n    *   **Pre-print Servers:** For fast-moving fields like AI, **arXiv** is non-negotiable. This is where you see research *months* or *years* before it's formally published.\r\n    *   **Top-Tier Conferences:** In computer science, conferences are often more important than journals. Monitor the proceedings from venues like NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, and CVPR.\r\n*   **Set Up Alerts:** Create automated alerts in databases to notify you of new publications that contain your keywords. This lets the research come to you."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"5222c3a5-bbb3-96e7-a3a8-432a42d1c015","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"cb7f1b67-8b70-4861-a31d-cc0a9d934875","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c9f6bd0c-fc48-4a42-b24e-c877ed6bb3e4","children":["e1556c9a-6a47-4772-a8c1-23a7fb8f7dfe"]},"e1556c9a-6a47-4772-a8c1-23a7fb8f7dfe":{"id":"e1556c9a-6a47-4772-a8c1-23a7fb8f7dfe","message":{"id":"e1556c9a-6a47-4772-a8c1-23a7fb8f7dfe","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763182217.341949,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"5222c3a5-bbb3-96e7-a3a8-432a42d1c015","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d7f16d88-fc72-48d2-8348-76745022fa62","turn_exchange_id":"cb7f1b67-8b70-4861-a31d-cc0a9d934875","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d7f16d88-fc72-48d2-8348-76745022fa62","children":["f5b47a8a-adad-4f95-874b-1c3e7cae0c30"]},"f5b47a8a-adad-4f95-874b-1c3e7cae0c30":{"id":"f5b47a8a-adad-4f95-874b-1c3e7cae0c30","message":{"id":"f5b47a8a-adad-4f95-874b-1c3e7cae0c30","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763182217.688229,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"5222c3a5-bbb3-96e7-a3a8-432a42d1c015","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"e1556c9a-6a47-4772-a8c1-23a7fb8f7dfe","turn_exchange_id":"cb7f1b67-8b70-4861-a31d-cc0a9d934875","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e1556c9a-6a47-4772-a8c1-23a7fb8f7dfe","children":["99a22c7e-927e-4997-bf90-83c53aa2ecc9"]},"99a22c7e-927e-4997-bf90-83c53aa2ecc9":{"id":"99a22c7e-927e-4997-bf90-83c53aa2ecc9","message":{"id":"99a22c7e-927e-4997-bf90-83c53aa2ecc9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763182218.814334,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating user's draft and critique","content":"The user asked for critique on their research draft, focusing on Goodhart's law and AI.

The core ideas are sound; the weak points are (i) some over-claims about mechanistic interpretability, (ii) the Goodhart connection being gestured at rather than made mathematically crisp, and (iii) the reading plan being too generic and not tuned to the specific directions you listed.\n\nLet me go through it in chunks.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Part 1 \u2013 Research directions\n\n### (1) Mechanistic interpretability as Goodhart-resistant solution\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- Framing \u201calignment as the ultimate Goodhart game\u201d is exactly right: reward/specification = proxy, human values = target. That\u2019s standard in reward-hacking discussions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search20\ue201  \n- Pointing at things like *Probing Knowledge Holes in Unlearned LLMs* as examples of probing failures beyond static benchmarks is very on-point: it *is* about metrics missing systematic blind spots created by unlearning. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n\n**Where I\u2019d tighten / be more honest:**\n\n- The line \u201ca microscope that could make gaming impossible by revealing the *intent* to game\u201d is too strong. Two issues:\n  - Mechanistic interpretability is itself a *proxy* (\u201cis this circuit understandable / labelled correctly?\u201d). Once you start using MI-derived features as targets, Goodhart applies *again*.\n  - Even if you see a deceptive circuit, you still need a *normative* layer that says \u201cthis pattern is unacceptable\u201d and a training/oversight mechanism that can actually penalize it. There\u2019s no guarantee you *can* find all such circuits or modify the model safely.\n- To make this a real research direction, you want to articulate **one or two concrete, formalizable questions**, e.g.:\n\n  - *Detection problem:* given a trained policy or PRM, can we define MI-based statistics such that any reward-hacking strategy that materially increases reward must produce a detectable shift in those statistics? (Think sparse autoencoders or circuit activations as monitored features.) This is close in spirit to recent work using interpretable features of reward models to mitigate reward hacking via causal adjustment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n  - *Robustness problem:* under what conditions can an agent *Goodhart the interpretability metric itself* without lowering external performance? i.e., can it develop obfuscated \u201cshadow circuits\u201d that evade your microscope?\n\nRight now you sketch the motivation but don\u2019t pin down a \u201cdoable first theorem/paper\u201d.\n\n### (2) Socio-technical alignment\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- You correctly identify that p-value failure was sociotechnical: incentives + metric, not \u201cmath was wrong\u201d. Drawing the parallel to AI governance / deployment is exactly the right level.\n- This is the direction that naturally connects with things like meta-science, Murphy-style \u201claws\u201d of alignment failures, etc., where repeated patterns of reward hacking, sycophancy, and drift show up under different institutional choices. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search26\ue202turn0search23\ue201  \n\n**What\u2019s missing:**\n\n- It\u2019s a bit *hand-wavy*. \u201cInvestigates interaction between AI systems and human social structures\u201d will get you blank stares from reviewers unless you sharpen it into a recognisable problem family.\n\nYou could, for example, explicitly frame it as **mechanism design under Goodhart**:\n\n- Principal(s) (labs, regulators, platforms) choose:\n  - proxy metrics (e.g., benchmark suites, alignment evals, red-teaming scores),\n  - and institutional rules (RRs, mandated evals, penalties for failures, etc.).\n- Agents (labs, model-deployers, models themselves) choose strategies: invest in genuine capability/alignment or in metric gaming (data leakage, reward hacking, cosmetic safety, etc.).\n- The *Goodhart question*: classify equilibria where the proxy remains informative vs equilibria where it collapses (systematically gamed).\n\nIf you phrase it like this, you can pull in tools from principal-agent theory, repeated games, and the adaptive-data-analysis literature (stability/DP as a design primitive).\n\n### (3) Scalable oversight and preference optimization\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- This is tightly connected to current frontier work. *Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization with Limited Feedback* is an excellent example: learn good reward signals from sparse pairwise feedback + lots of unpaired data, with a proven \u201creward threshold separates winners and losers\u201d result. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n- \u201cGetting the most alignment bang from the fewest human bucks\u201d is exactly the practical problem everyone is working on.\n\n**What you\u2019re underplaying:**\n\n- The Goodhart failure mode here is **pseudo-label propagation of mis-specified rewards**. If your initial reward model is subtly biased, SSPO-style schemes can massively amplify that bias across the unlabeled pool. That\u2019s Goodhart in a semi-supervised setting.\n- So the natural research questions are things like:\n  - Under what assumptions on the true preference distribution and the reward-model error can threshold-based pseudo-labelling remain alignment-preserving?\n  - Can we design **Goodhart-robust preference optimisation** procedures that explicitly model worst-case mis-specification of the reward model, maybe borrowing from robust stats / e-value thinking?\n\nI\u2019d make that link explicit so it doesn\u2019t read as \u201cscalable oversight\u201d in general, but \u201cscalable oversight that doesn\u2019t Goodhart itself to death\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### Meta-comment on Part 1\n\nThe three directions are all *plausible and timely*, but if you present them as-is in a research proposal I\u2019d expect the following pushback:\n\n- \u201cWhere are the **formal questions**?\u201d\n- \u201cHow does this build on the *statistical* Goodhart story we just developed (selective inference, e-values, DP, etc.) rather than just name-dropping Goodhart as a metaphor?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need a full maths treatment in this document, but you should add at least a paragraph under each direction that states:\n\n- a toy model (even informal: \u2018consider a reward-hacked math tutor agent with a PRM\u2026\u2019),\n- the precise failure mode,\n- and the primitive(s) you think will fix it (MI features, DP-style stability, martingale-based monitoring, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Part 2 \u2013 Reading course\n\nThis section is well-structured *as generic study advice*, but it\u2019s not yet doing the job you actually need it to do.\n\n### What\u2019s good:\n\n- The \u201cfind a niche via reviews / future work / conflict\u201d advice is correct and practical.\n- CARS is a decent mental model for writing research introductions.\n- The \u201cTrifecta\u201d (review + seminal + latest paper) is a useful heuristic.\n\n### Weaknesses / misalignment with your actual goal:\n\n1. **Too generic for your level.**  \n   Things like SQ3R, \u201cdon\u2019t highlight too much\u201d, and Zotero vs Mendeley are what I\u2019d tell a first-year undergrad or a brand-new MSc student. They\u2019re not wrong; they\u2019re just not where your marginal gains are.\n\n2. **Not anchored in the three directions you just outlined.**  \n   You give an LLM basics list (Transformer, BERT, GPT-3, Chinchilla, InstructGPT), which is fine, but nothing specifically about:\n   - Goodhart & reward hacking in RL/RLHF/LLMs,\n   - mechanistic interpretability as used for safety,\n   - or scalable oversight & SSPO.\n\n3. **Citations are placeholders.**  \n   You refer to [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] without actually specifying them. If you intend this as something shareable, you need to attach a real bibliography, or you\u2019ll confuse readers (including Future You).\n\n### How I\u2019d refocus it\n\nIf this is meant for *you* rather than as generic advice to students, I\u2019d compress all the generic meta-reading content to a short appendix and instead define three **domain-specific reading tracks** that mirror Part 1:\n\n---\n\n#### Track A \u2013 Goodhart & Reward Hacking in ML/RL\n\nGoal: internalise how the Goodhart story shows up in modern ML/AI.\n\n- Goodhart/reward hacking blog & survey-style content (for intuition and examples). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search20\ue201  \n- Classical \u201cspecification gaming\u201d case collections (DeepMind, Krakovna, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue201  \n- Recent work like *Murphy\u2019s Laws of AI Alignment* that empirically catalogues recurring failure modes (reward hacking, sycophancy, proxy drift). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search26\ue201  \n\n---\n\n#### Track B \u2013 Mechanistic interpretability & Goodhart-aware safety\n\nGoal: understand what current MI can actually do, and where it intersects with Goodhart.\n\n- A decent MI-for-safety review that explicitly discusses Goodhart/reward risks and phase transitions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n- Concrete case studies where MI is used to:\n  - detect deceptive or reward-hacking behaviour (e.g. causal reward adjustment using sparse autoencoders on PRM activations). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n  - study representations related to safety-relevant concepts (e.g., honesty, sycophancy, power-seeking, etc.).\n\n- The *Probing Knowledge Holes in Unlearned LLMs* paper you cite\u2014read with a Goodhart lens: unlearning proxies vs true knowledge preservation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\n---\n\n#### Track C \u2013 Scalable oversight and preference optimisation\n\nGoal: understand the current frontier in label-efficient alignment and where Goodhart creeps in.\n\n- *InstructGPT* / RLHF foundations (even if you\u2019ve read it, revisit with explicit attention to reward misspecification and oversight bottlenecks).\n- *Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization with Limited Feedback* (SSPO) and related preference-optimization papers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n  - Read with this question in mind: \u201cwhere could a mis-specified initial reward model Goodhart the whole pseudo-labelling process?\u201d\n- Work on scalable oversight mechanisms (debate, recursive reward modelling, model-assisted human feedback, verifiable reward frameworks, etc.) and any analyses that touch on reward hacking or adversarial policies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search29\ue201  \n\n---\n\n**Then**, if you want to keep the general \u201chow to read papers\u201d section, stick it at the end as \u201cAppendix: meta-skills for staying on the frontier\u201d, and keep it lean: CARS + Trifecta + one paragraph on tools (Zotero + a lit-mapping tool) is probably enough for you.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Concrete edits I\u2019d make\n\nIf you want to iterate this draft:\n\n- Change the claim about mechanistic interpretability from \u201ccould make gaming impossible\u201d to something like \u201caims to shift us from purely behavioural metrics to partial visibility into internal computation, which *might* make some classes of gaming detectable ex ante rather than ex post\u201d.\n- Under each of the three directions, add a short \u201c**Example research question**\u201d paragraph with at least one quasi-formal statement.\n- Replace the generic LLM \u201cstarter pack\u201d with three mini reading lists corresponding to Tracks A/B/C above.\n- Move or shrink the general research-skills content; assume your target reader is already highly literate in reading papers and using reference managers.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can take your text and rewrite Part 1 into \u201cproposal-grade\u201d form with explicit toy models and hypotheses, and compress Part 2 into a targeted reading list + a short meta-skills appendix."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search20\ue201","start_idx":753,"end_idx":787,"safe_urls":["https://blog.darpanjain.com/jekyll/update/2025/05/13/reward-hacking.html","https://blog.darpanjain.com/jekyll/update/2025/05/13/reward-hacking.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/category/machine-learning/","https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/category/machine-learning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Victoria Krakovna](https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/category/machine-learning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"machine learning | Victoria Krakovna","url":"https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/category/machine-learning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"2 Jun 2022 \u2014 ...

With your setup we can already make several *clean, almost toy-level* Goodhart statements before we worry about detailed assumptions on \\(f,e,g,\\epsilon\\).\n\nLet me restate the setup in my own notation, then I\u2019ll layer in a few \u201cGoodhart assertions\u201d of increasing subtlety.\n\n- Covariates: \\(X = (X_1,\\dots,X_n)\\).\n- True objective:\n  \\[\n  Y = f(X) + e\n  \\]\n- Proxy:\n  \\[\n  W = g(X) + \\epsilon\n  \\]\n- Baseline distribution over \\((X,e,\\epsilon)\\): call it \\(P_0\\).\n- A policymaker can change the distribution of \\(X\\) (and, depending on the variant, maybe the distribution of \\(e,\\epsilon\\) or even the functions \\(f,g\\)).\n\nWe\u2019ll call a *policy* \\(\\pi\\) any intervention that induces a new distribution \\(P_\\pi\\) over \\(X\\) (and possibly the rest).\n\n---\n\n## 1. \u201cArgmax misalignment\u201d Goodhart\n\nThis is the most basic: even if \\(W\\) is a decent *predictor* of \\(Y\\) under \\(P_0\\), optimizing it as a control objective can clearly mislead you.\n\n> **Assertion 1 (Weak argmax Goodhart).**  \n> Suppose there exist two covariate values \\(x,x'\\) such that\n> \\[\n> f(x) > f(x')\\quad\\text{but}\\quad g(x) \\le g(x').\n> \\]\n> Then there exist two policies \\(\\pi, \\pi'\\) supported only on \\(\\{x,x'\\}\\) such that\n> \\[\n> \\mathbb{E}_\\pi[W] > \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi'}[W] \\quad\\text{but}\\quad \\mathbb{E}_\\pi[Y] < \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi'}[Y].\n> \\]\n> In particular, an optimizer of \\(\\mathbb{E}_\\pi[W]\\) need not optimize \\(\\mathbb{E}_\\pi[Y]\\).\n\n*Sketch:* Take \\(\\pi\\) that puts mass entirely on \\(x'\\) and \\(\\pi'\\) that puts mass entirely on \\(x\\) (or appropriate mixtures if you like). Then\n- \\(\\mathbb{E}_\\pi[W] \\approx g(x')\\), \\(\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi'}[W] \\approx g(x)\\);\n- \\(\\mathbb{E}_\\pi[Y] \\approx f(x')\\), \\(\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi'}[Y] \\approx f(x)\\).\n\nBy assumption, these inequalities go opposite ways.  \n\n**Interpretation:** unless \\(g\\) is *order-preserving* with respect to \\(f\\) (no mis-rankings of points in \\(X\\)-space), there is always some policy that improves the proxy and worsens the true objective.\n\n> **Corollary (no-Goodhart condition).**  \n> The only way to *rule out* Assertion 1 is if\n> \\[\n> f(x_1) > f(x_2)\\;\\Rightarrow\\; g(x_1) > g(x_2)\\quad\\forall x_1,x_2\n> \\]\n> i.e. \\(g\\) is a strictly increasing function of \\(f\\) (up to additive noise that is independent of \\(X\\) and symmetric). In most real settings this is false, so argmax Goodhart is generically available.\n\nThis is the bare-minimum structural Goodhart statement in your framework.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Regressional Goodhart (selection on noise)\n\nNow assume some minimal stochastics:\n\n- Conditional on \\(X\\), \\(e\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) are mean-zero, independent, and have finite variance.\n- We think of \\(f(X)\\) and \\(g(X)\\) as positively correlated under \\(P_0\\), so \\(W\\) is a reasonable *predictor* of \\(Y\\) in the observational regime.\n\nWhen a policymaker selects on large observed \\(W\\), they are also selecting on positive realizations of \\(\\epsilon\\), not just on large \\(g(X)\\).\n\n> **Assertion 2 (Regressional Goodhart / regression to the mean).**  \n> Under the assumptions above, suppose \\(\\text{Var}(g(X))>0\\) and \\(\\text{Var}(\\epsilon)>0\\). Then for large thresholds \\(t\\),\n> \\[\n> \\mathbb{E}\\!\\big[Y \\,\\big|\\, W \\ge t\\big]\n> \\;<\\;\n> \\mathbb{E}\\!\\big[g(X) \\,\\big|\\, W \\ge t\\big]\n> \\quad\\text{and the gap is driven by the noise selection.}\n> \\]\n> More informally: among units with extremely high \\(W\\), the \u201ctrue\u201d component \\(f(X)\\) is, in expectation, less extreme than \\(W\\) would suggest, because some of the extremeness came from \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\nYou can make this crisp in the Gaussian case:\n\n- If \\(Y\\) and \\(W\\) are jointly Gaussian with correlation \\(\\rho \\in (0,1)\\), then  \n  \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid W = w] = \\mu_Y + \\rho \\frac{\\sigma_Y}{\\sigma_W}(w - \\mu_W)\\).  \n  The slope \\(\\rho \\frac{\\sigma_Y}{\\sigma_W}\\) is strictly less than \\(\\frac{\\sigma_Y}{\\sigma_W}\\) when \\(|\\rho|<1\\).\n\nSo, conditioning on high \\(W\\), the best linear predictor of \\(Y\\) \u201cregresses\u201d towards the mean relative to \\(W\\).\n\n**Interpretation:** even if the *ranking* of units by \\(W\\) is still partially meaningful, the *magnitude* becomes misleading at high extremes\u2014extreme \\(W\\) overstates the extremeness of \\(Y\\). When a policymaker chases \u201ctop 1%\u201d \\(W\\)-scores, they are partly chasing noise.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Extremal Goodhart (pushing out of the regime of validity)\n\nNow add the fact that our beliefs about \\(f,g\\) are based on some \u201ctraining\u201d distribution over \\(X\\), say supported on a compact set \\(K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\).\n\nLet:\n\n- \\(P_0\\) be supported on \\(K\\).\n- On \\(K\\), we have empirically validated that \\(W\\) is a good proxy for \\(Y\\) (e.g. \\(\\text{Corr}(f(X), g(X))>0\\) and few mis-rankings).\n- The policymaker can enact policies that move mass outside \\(K\\) to some region \\(K^c\\) to try to further increase \\(W\\).\n\n> **Assertion 3 (Extremal/distribution-shift Goodhart).**  \n> Suppose \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are only constrained on \\(K\\), and outside \\(K\\) they are unconstrained (or weakly constrained). Then there exist extensions \\(\\tilde f,\\tilde g\\) agreeing with \\(f,g\\) on \\(K\\) such that:\n> - Under \\(P_0\\) (support in \\(K\\)), \\(W\\) is positively correlated with \\(Y\\).  \n> - There exists a policy \\(\\pi\\) that moves all mass to some \\(x^\\star \\in K^c\\) with very large \\(\\tilde g(x^\\star)\\) but very low \\(\\tilde f(x^\\star)\\), so\n>   \\[\n>   \\mathbb{E}_{P_\\pi}[W] \\gg \\mathbb{E}_{P_0}[W],\\quad\n>   \\mathbb{E}_{P_\\pi}[Y] \\ll \\mathbb{E}_{P_0}[Y].\n>   \\]\n\nThis is a constructive way of saying: *if you haven\u2019t constrained how the objective and proxy behave in the tails / off-distribution, then there is no guarantee that pushing the proxy to new extremes will do anything sensible to the true objective.*\n\nYou can read this as: \u201cGoodhart is unavoidable under distribution shift unless your prior on \\(f,g\\) enforces alignment everywhere, not just locally.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4. Causal / measurement Goodhart (manipulating the proxy directly)\n\nSo far policies only changed the distribution of \\(X\\). Let\u2019s now allow policies that also affect the **measurement process** \\(g\\) (or the noise \\(\\epsilon\\)).\n\nConcrete examples:\n\n- You can change how GDP is computed (reclassify certain financial flows, tweak deflators, etc.) without changing real living standards.\n- You can change your benchmark suite or data annotation protocol so your model\u2019s \u201cbenchmark accuracy\u201d goes up, without the underlying capabilities changing in the way you care about.\n\nFormally:\n\n- Let \\(g_\\theta\\) and \\(\\epsilon_\\theta\\) denote a family of measurement processes indexed by policy \\(\\theta\\).\n- The true objective \\(f\\) and the distribution of \\(X\\) may or may not change under \\(\\theta\\). For the clearest Goodhart effect, assume we *don\u2019t* change them.\n\n> **Assertion 4 (Causal / measurement Goodhart).**  \n> Suppose there is a policy \\(\\theta\\) such that:\n> \\[\n> Y = f(X) + e \\quad\\text{is unchanged in distribution under }\\theta,\n> \\]\n> but for some \\(\\theta\\),\n> \\[\n> W_\\theta = g_\\theta(X) + \\epsilon_\\theta\n> \\]\n> satisfies \\(\\mathbb{E}[W_\\theta] > \\mathbb{E}[W_0]\\).  \n> Then a policymaker can increase \\(\\mathbb{E}[W]\\) (and claim \u201csuccess\u201d) without any real improvement in \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y]\\).\n\nThis is the cleanest formalization of *pure metric hacking*: policies that act on the measurement channel, not on the underlying state of the world.\n\nWe can add a \u201cno-Goodhart\u201d condition here too: if you want to rule this out, you have to enforce that any admissible policy that raises expected \\(W\\) must act (at least partially) by improving \\(f(X)\\) or reducing harm in \\(e\\), not by messing solely with \\(g,\\epsilon\\).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Adversarial Goodhart (strategic agents in the loop)\n\nIntroduce strategic actors whose choices are part of \\(X\\) and who respond to the policymaker\u2019s announced objective \u201cmaximize \\(W\\)\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s split:\n\n- \\(X = (Z, A)\\), where:\n  - \\(Z\\) = non-strategic covariates (environment, exogenous factors),\n  - \\(A\\) = actions chosen by agents (firms, bureaucrats, model-deployers, the LLM itself as a policy, etc.).\n- The policymaker sets a rule that rewards high \\(W\\).\n- Agents choose \\(A\\) to maximize their private payoff, which depends on \\(W\\) but may not depend on \\(Y\\) at all.\n\nWe can model this as:\n\n- For fixed policy rule, agents best-respond with \\(A^\\star(Z)\\) that (locally) maximizes \\(g(Z, A)\\) subject to their own constraints.\n- This induces an *equilibrium mapping* \\(X^\\star = (Z, A^\\star(Z))\\) and hence equilibrium distributions of \\(Y,W\\).\n\n> **Assertion 5 (Adversarial Goodhart / strategic response).**  \n> Suppose there exists some exogenous \\(Z\\) and actions \\(A_1,A_2\\) such that:\n> \\[\n> f(Z, A_1) > f(Z, A_2) \\quad\\text{but}\\quad g(Z, A_1) < g(Z, A_2).\n> \\]\n> If the policymaker pays agents increasing in \\(W\\), and agents choose \\(A\\) to maximize their payoff (hence \\(g\\)), then in equilibrium the system will tend to select \\(A_2\\) over \\(A_1\\), lowering \\(Y\\) while raising \\(W\\).\n\nThis is just the argmax misalignment from Assertion 1, but now *implemented by strategic choice* instead of an exogenously chosen policy over \\(X\\).\n\n---\n\n## 6. How this gives you a clean \u201cGoodhart family\u201d in your toy model\n\nWith just your elementary setup, we already have:\n\n1. **Argmax Goodhart:** mis-ranking in \\(g\\) vs \\(f\\) implies existence of policies that improve \\(W\\) and worsen \\(Y\\).\n2. **Regressional Goodhart:** selection on high \\(W\\) partially selects on noise \\(\\epsilon\\), so extreme \\(W\\) values overstate the extremeness of \\(Y\\).\n3. **Extremal/distribution-shift Goodhart:** pushing the system into regions of \\(X\\)-space where you have no alignment guarantees between \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) allows arbitrarily bad decoupling.\n4. **Causal/measurement Goodhart:** manipulating the measurement channel \\(g,\\epsilon\\) alone can increase \\(W\\) while leaving \\(Y\\) unchanged.\n5. **Adversarial Goodhart:** strategic agents exploit misalignment between \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) to choose actions that increase \\(W\\) at the expense of \\(Y\\).\n\nEach of these can be strengthened or quantified once you decide on specific assumptions about:\n\n- the distributions of \\(X,e,\\epsilon\\),\n- resource constraints on policies,\n- and whether policies can alter the structural functions \\(f,g\\) or only the distribution of inputs.\n\nIf you like, next step could be: pick one of these assertions (probably 1 or 2) and turn it into a fully formal \u201cif and only if\u201d statement: e.g., characterize exactly when *every* policy that improves \\(W\\) must improve \\(Y\\), and show that this is essentially equivalent to \u201c\\(g\\) is a strictly increasing function of \\(f\\) plus independent noise\u201d (which gives you a clean baseline for \u201cno-Goodhart world\u201d)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":10592,"end_idx":10592,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"1927fd3a-cb4c-4ea4-8fea-2e3fa98d5004","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"4e61adcf-a5a8-4b1b-9db1-76489aa8cfda","turn_exchange_id":"08fba351-7ff3-4726-b5f1-d04d1519d16d","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"4e61adcf-a5a8-4b1b-9db1-76489aa8cfda","children":["f7f77535-2f48-4eb4-8cbe-8088a496b08c"]},"f7f77535-2f48-4eb4-8cbe-8088a496b08c":{"id":"f7f77535-2f48-4eb4-8cbe-8088a496b08c","message":{"id":"f7f77535-2f48-4eb4-8cbe-8088a496b08c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763190306.579,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["From what we have discussed so far in this chat, narrow down research directions and questions I can address if I wish to focus more on theory, and using toy data sets illustrate the outcome of my theorems, as opposed to benchmarking on real world data."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"16285b77-1f91-480f-b9ab-e6e772a7dc8d","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"973a2765-66d8-4561-ab88-a8a4e8602479","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5c706542-dcd3-42d8-bf93-f845132d7f61","children":["c47bcd0b-422c-43da-be09-130ed0ee12b7"]},"c47bcd0b-422c-43da-be09-130ed0ee12b7":{"id":"c47bcd0b-422c-43da-be09-130ed0ee12b7","message":{"id":"c47bcd0b-422c-43da-be09-130ed0ee12b7","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1763190330.583115,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\n\n**Proposing narrowed research directions with theoretical focus**\n\nFor this mathematics research, I\u2019ll propose theoretical directions with toy datasets to illustrate theorems. I\u2019ll focus on aspects like monotone transform conditions, isotonic/monotone properties, partial orders, and mathematical models. The goal is to present metrics like p-values, e-values, and ensure research aligns with elementary frameworks.\n\n**Proposing formal statements with conditions for monotonicity**\n\nI\u2019ll propose necessary and sufficient conditions, focusing on the relationship between g and f, where g = \u03c8 \u2218 f with a strictly increasing \u03c8, ensuring that W is monotone with Y, and addressing noise with properties like MLR or copula order. I\u2019ll also clarify that maximizing E[W] is equivalent to maximizing E[f(X)], but only under specific conditions like affine functions for g.\n\n**Strengthening the conditions for monotonicity and policy implication**\n\nTo ensure consistent ordering across distributions, g must be strictly increasing and co-monotone with f, i.e., g(x) = \u03c6(f(x)) with \u03c6 strictly increasing. If we restrict to deterministic policies, monotonic composition becomes necessary and sufficient. I\u2019ll propose a theorem: for such policies, the proxy is safe if and only if g is monotone and noise doesn\u2019t affect the expectation ordering.\n\n**Generalizing to randomized policies with affine transformations**\n\nWhen considering noise, the ordering remains based on g, which reduces to requiring monotone composition. For randomized policies, this leads to a condition where g must be an increasing affine transform of f. If g is non-linear, distributions may differ in E[g], breaking the ordering. Theorem B formalizes this necessary condition and uses Jensen's inequality for proof.\n\n**Proposing Goodhartization and robustness under adaptivity**\n\nI\u2019m setting up a theorem for Goodhart quantification and selection noise in a Gaussian linear model. I'll look at how top-k selections impact expected outcomes, relating selection thresholds, and correlating Y and W. I'll also discuss extremal Goodhart risks due to distribution shifts, using Lipschitz constants and co-monotonicity to propose misalignment bounds.\n\n**Narrowing research on Goodhart risks and safe proxy design**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about three possible research directions. First, I\u2019ll focus on defining safe proxy conditions that guarantee no Goodhart for deterministic and randomized policies, using toy datasets for demonstration. Second, I\u2019ll explore error inflation in resource-bounded optimizers. Finally, I\u2019ll look at using e-values for robustification, focusing on theoretical results with toy simulations.\n\n**Framing proxy safety, noise selection, and distribution shift risks**\n\nI'm structuring the research in clear sections: \nFirst, the \"Scope and assumptions\" section. Then, Direction 1 focuses on proxy safety with deterministic and randomized policies, including toy data examples. Direction 2 quantifies noise selection, with the correlation formula and expected Y at the argmax of N draws. Lastly, Direction 3 will set bounds on distribution shift risks.\n\n**Defining Goodhartization research scope and propositions**\n\nI\u2019ll propose clearer directions: Direction 4 focuses on \"Measurement tampering tests,\" where two proxies are used to detect manipulation. Direction 5 will involve a simple principal-agent model addressing misalignment in equilibrium. We\u2019ll refine the scope to three research directions: Safe proxy design, selection-on-noise curves, and shift-robustness bounds.\n\n**The user wants to include Monte Carlo simulation and other computer-aided sampling methods in their theoretical research approach, particularly for illustrating outcomes with toy data sets.**\n\n**Planning research directions based on Monte Carlo simulation**\n\nThe user wants a focus on theory and toy datasets, incorporating Monte Carlo simulation and other computer-aided sampling methods, without real-world benchmarking. We should suggest several research directions with concrete questions: Proxy-safety theorems, selection-on-noise/regressional goodhart, measurement tampering detection, and possibly robust proxies using e-values or distribution shift bounds.\n\n**Creating the Monte Carlo simulation plan**\n\nI need to outline the research plan, including questions, theorems, simulation design, and key metrics like plots. I'll define toy data distributions and parameters, suggesting theoretical outcomes and Monte Carlo replicates where relevant. I'll propose pseudocode for the simulations, specify sample sizes, seeds, and also present expected theoretical curves while considering experiments with factors like correlation and noise.\n\n**Exploring additional computational methods and tests**\n\nWe can consider methods like bootstrap, importance sampling, or MCMC if including a Bayesian perspective. Also, adding a wedge for E[Y] vs E[W] could highlight distribution-ordering issues. We'll explore Goodhart illusions and propose a tampering detection test using proxies W1 and W2. Lastly, introducing e-value simulations for optional stopping allows us to test p-value inflation.\n\n**Focusing on theory and toy data with Monte Carlo**\n\nThe user wants to focus on theory and toy data, but we can include optional directions. One idea is creating a \"toy LLM\" environment, defining functions for true quality and benchmark metrics, to show alignment failures. We can also propose a principal-agent game and simulate alignment failure, while keeping the plan concise and focused on Monte Carlo.\n\n**Structuring the plan with MC simulation**\n\nWe'll focus on theoretical work with toy simulations, outlining three directions. The first involves proxy-safety under policy classes, with two key theorems: Theorem A (deterministic policies) and Theorem B (randomized distributions), and Monte Carlo demonstration steps. We'll also include clear research questions and provide pseudocode where applicable, avoiding over-explanation.\n\n**Elucidating Monte Carlo designs for Goodhart theorems**\n\nFor Direction 1, we\u2019ll use a non-linear function \u03c6 (like squaring or exponential) to violate ordering across mixtures, then correct with affine adjustments. We\u2019ll demonstrate with plots and compute expectations. Direction 2 focuses on regression and selection Goodhart quantification, detailing theorems and an MC plan to test various correlations and sample sizes.\n\n**Outlining MC designs and measurement manipulation tests**\n\nStep 1: For Direction 3, we\u2019ll simulate proxies with independent noise and use regression to calibrate pre-policy relationships. Following policy changes, we create a test statistic to detect tampering. Direction 4 explores e-values as anti-Goodhart proxies. I'll also suggest a \"toy dataset kit\" for simulations with pseudocode."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 9m

At its root, I see the law as a direct corollary of the principle that \"correlation does not imply causation\". If you target a biomarker, for example, you may not be doing anything to improve the underlying health condition because the biomarker is simply correlated to the health condition in question, rather than being able to serve as a mchanism by which that health condition can be improved. \n\nNow for LLMs the situation is different. Frontier labs are now optimizing models to excel in benchmarks. But when users deploy model for real world tasks, very often they do not perform as well as expected given the high benchmark scores. Here, Goodhart's Law is clearly in operation in the most classical sense. Once a benchmark of performance is targetted, that benchmark ceases to be a good measure of performance (performance in this case refers to real world deployability, not to standardized scores achieved in a sanitized laboratory). However in this case, even though we can quantify the difference between expectation versus reality, it is hard for me to see how Goodhart's Law is anything more than a simple empirical tool to explain these observations.

I'll focus on providing precise analysis and critique where necessary. Since this is conceptual, I won\u2019t browse for info\u2014it's not a time-sensitive topic.\n\n**Clarifying Goodhart\u2019s Law with formal framing**\n\nI need to present Goodhart's Law clearly in mathematical terms, showing it\u2019s more than just empirical. For example, illustrating the difference between optimizing W (a proxy) vs Y (the target) with formal \"impossibility\" results. I\u2019ll also touch on nuances like correlation vs. causation, selection bias, and provide specific theorems for better understanding.\n\n**Providing proof for affine function relationship in distributions**\n\nI want to explain that if E[g] being higher implies E[f] is higher for all distributions P, then g must be an affine function of f. I\u2019ll outline a formal proof for this and also include related concepts from linear Gaussian models (LGM) and surrogate efficiency. Some literature on surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, like Prentice (1989) and Freedman, can help contextualize this.\n\n**Proposing minimal mathematical bedrock for Goodhart\u2019s Law**\n\nTo provide a solid foundation, I\u2019ll focus on minimal theorems: 1) Safe improvement theorems. 2) Sample selection and regression to the mean. 3) Valid e-values. 4) Extreme value effects when optimization over proxies leads to outcomes dominated by noise (extremal Goodhart). These will help clarify the core theory while avoiding unnecessary citations.\n\n**Defining Goodhartization and potential theorems**\n\nI\u2019m proposing definitions around Goodhart\u2019s Law, starting with the baseline distribution and agent\u2019s policy choice. Goodhartization happens when optimizing a proxy (W) leads to worsening the target (Y). I'll also introduce ideas like identifiability barriers, optimal transport mis-specification, and how LLM benchmarks can exacerbate this issue under distribution shift.\n\n**Clarifying Goodhart with formal definitions**\n\nWe should clarify that Goodhart is not just about correlation vs. causation\u2014it focuses on how optimization changes distributions. I want to define Goodhart gaps, propose a measure for the Goodhart coefficient, and explore causal surrogacy with formal conditions. I'll also introduce a counterexample where correlation doesn\u2019t guarantee improvement.\n\n**Presenting Goodhart with formal theorems**\n\nWe can use a simple causal model (SCM) to explain how optimizing for benchmarks in LLMs can lead to optimization that distorts true ability, which is similar to Goodhart's Law. I\u2019ll present a few theorems: Order preservation, Extremal Goodhart, Regressional Goodhart, and Causal Goodhart to formalize these effects and show their implications.\n\n**Outlining Goodhartization with adaptivity**\n\nI will provide a theorem that quantifies the impact of adaptivity on generalization errors, relating it to mutual information between evaluation choices and test data. Then, I'll introduce a \"Goodhartization index\" to measure the policy\u2019s effects and include Monte Carlo simulations for better understanding. I'll keep the language precise and structure the message with clear sections.\n\n**Crafting Theorems for Goodhartization**\n\nI\u2019ll create a few theorems with statements and sketches of proofs: \n\n1. Proposition 1: If increasing one quantity leads to the other increasing, the relationship must be linear and strictly increasing.\n\n2. Proposition 2: Regressional effects show that selection leads to shrinkage; extreme selections cause gain mismatch.\n\n3.

Deterministic policies: order preservation is **iff**\n\nConsider \\(\\Pi=\\{\\delta_x:x\\in\\mathcal{X}\\}\\).\n\n> **Theorem 1 (Pairwise safety).**  \n> There is **no** Goodhartization on \\(\\Pi\\) **iff** \\(g\\) preserves the order of \\(f\\):\n> \\[\n> (f(x_1)-f(x_2))\\,(g(x_1)-g(x_2))\\ge 0\\quad\\forall x_1,x_2\\in\\mathcal{X}.\n> \\]\n> Equivalently, there exists a strictly increasing \\(\\phi\\) with \\(g=\\phi\\circ f\\) on \\(\\mathcal{X}\\).\n\n*Sketch.* If order is preserved, picking higher \\(g\\) can\u2019t lower \\(f\\). If order is violated for some pair, a policy that moves probability from the better\u2011\\(f\\) point to the better\u2011\\(g\\) point witnesses Goodhartization.\n\n**Toy Monte Carlo.** Let \\(f(x)=x\\) on \\([-1,1]\\).  \n(i) \\(g(x)=x\\): zero violations.  \n(ii) \\(g(x)=\\tanh(\\lambda x)\\): still zero (monotone).  \n(iii) \\(g(x)=x+\\alpha\\sin(10x)\\): violations appear once \\(\\alpha\\) is large; plot violation rate vs \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n---\n\n### B2. Distributional policies: **affine** is the only globally safe case\n\nLet \\(\\Pi\\) be all probability distributions on \\(\\mathcal{X}\\).\n\n> **Theorem 2 (Expectation safety across distributions).**  \n> The implication\n> \\[\n> w(\\pi_1)\\ge w(\\pi_2)\\ \\Rightarrow\\ y(\\pi_1)\\ge y(\\pi_2)\\quad\\text{for all }\\pi_1,\\pi_2\n> \\]\n> holds **iff** \\(g=af+b\\) with \\(a>0\\).\n\n*Sketch.* Sufficiency: linearity of expectation. Necessity: if \\(g=\\phi\\!\\circ\\! f\\) with strictly increasing but nonlinear \\(\\phi\\), pick two distributions with the same mean \\(f\\) but different variance; Jensen flips the ordering of \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\phi(f)]\\). If \\(g\\) is not a function of \\(f\\) on \\(f\\)-level sets, concentrate \\(\\pi_1,\\pi_2\\) on two points with identical \\(f\\) but different \\(g\\).\n\n**Toy Monte Carlo.** Take \\(f(X)=X\\) and compare \\(\\pi_1=\\mathrm{Unif}[-1,1]\\) to \\(\\pi_2\\) a symmetric two\u2011point mixture with the same \\(\\mathbb{E}[f]\\) but larger variance; with \\(g(f)=f^3\\) you\u2019ll see \\(w(\\pi_1)\\ne w(\\pi_2)\\) while \\(y(\\pi_1)=y(\\pi_2)\\).\n\n---\n\n### B3. Regressional Goodhart: selection on extremes **must** overstate improvements\n\nAssume \\((Y,W)\\) is bivariate normal with correlation \\(\\rho\\in(0,1)\\).\n\n> **Theorem 3 (Goodhart regression curve).**  \n> \\[\n> \\mathbb{E}[Y\\,|\\,W=w]=\\alpha\\,w,\\quad \\alpha=\\rho\\frac{\\sigma_Y}{\\sigma_W}\\in(0,1].\n> \\]\n> Consequently, for any high threshold \\(t\\),  \n> \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y\\,|\\,W\\ge t]=\\alpha\\,\\mathbb{E}[W\\,|\\,W\\ge t]\\),  \n> so extreme \\(W\\) systematically **overstates** gains in \\(Y\\) by a fixed shrinkage factor \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n**Toy Monte Carlo.** Simulate \\((Y,W)\\) for \\(\\rho\\in\\{0.2,0.5,0.8\\}\\), estimate the slope \\(\\alpha\\) from the conditional means at varying \\(t\\); it stays near \\(\\rho \\sigma_Y/\\sigma_W\\) and never reaches 1 unless \\(\\rho=1\\).\n\n**\u201cMany tries\u201d variant (winner\u2019s curse).** If you pick the largest \\(W\\) out of \\(N\\) i.i.d. candidates, \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y]\\) at the selected index scales like \\(\\alpha\\,\\mathbb{E}[W_{(N)}]\\); the gap grows with \\(N\\).\n\n---\n\n### B4. Causal/surrogate paradox: a constructive 2\u00d72 counterexample\n\nLet \\(A\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) be an intervention (training regime, policy), \\(W\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) a surrogate/benchmark, \\(Y\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) the true outcome. Define:\n\\[\n\\Pr(W{=}1\\mid A{=}1)=0.9,\\quad \\Pr(W{=}1\\mid A{=}0)=0.6\\quad(\\text{proxy improves}).\n\\]\nLet the *direct* effect of \\(A\\) on \\(Y\\) reverse sign within \\(W\\)-strata:\n\\[\n\\Pr(Y{=}1\\mid W{=}1,A{=}1)=0.40 < 0.65=\\Pr(Y{=}1\\mid W{=}1,A{=}0),\\\\\n\\Pr(Y{=}1\\mid W{=}0,A{=}1)=0.20 < 0.35=\\Pr(Y{=}1\\mid W{=}0,A{=}0).\n\\]\nMarginally, \\(W\\) is positively associated with \\(Y\\) in both arms (0.65>0.35; 0.40>0.20), **and** \\(A\\) raises \\(W\\), **yet**\n\\[\n\\Pr(Y{=}1\\mid A{=}1)=0.9\\cdot 0.40 + 0.1\\cdot 0.20=0.38\\\\\n\\Pr(Y{=}1\\mid A{=}0)=0.6\\cdot 0.65 + 0.4\\cdot 0.35=0.53,\n\\]\nso the intervention **harms** \\(Y\\) while improving \\(W\\). This is the formal surrogate endpoint paradox: optimizing the surrogate causes the true outcome to fall.\n\n**Toy Monte Carlo.** Generate \\(10^6\\) draws from that table; estimate the three effects to see the sign pattern persist with tiny standard errors.\n\n---\n\n## C. Why this goes beyond \u201ccorrelation \u2260 causation\u201d\n\n- **Theorem 1\u20132** show Goodhartization is equivalent to a *failure of monotone decision\u2011theoretic sufficiency*: unless \\(g\\) is a monotone transform of \\(f\\) (deterministic policies) or an *affine* transform (distributional policies), there will exist policies that increase \\(W\\) while lowering \\(Y\\). No correlations, no regressions\u2014just order and linearity.\n\n- **Theorem 3** quantifies the *regressional* mode: chasing high \\(W\\) selects positive noise in \\(\\epsilon\\), producing a fixed, predictable shrinkage in \\(Y\\). This is a clean, parameterized law you can test in toy normals (and it persists qualitatively beyond them).\n\n- **Theorem 4** is a causal claim in Pearl\u2019s sense: all three of  \n  (i) \\(A\\) improves the benchmark;  \n  (ii) benchmark and outcome are positively associated within treatment arms;  \n  (iii) yet \\(A\\) harms the outcome\u2014  \n  can be true simultaneously. So \u201cbenchmark goes up \u21d2 outcome goes up\u201d simply **does not hold** without the surrogate being causally sufficient.\n\nTogether, these theorems *are* a mathematical bedrock: Goodhart is a family of necessary failures unless very strong structural conditions hold.\n\n---\n\n## D. How this maps to LLM benchmarks vs deployment\n\nLet \\(A\\) be a training recipe (RLHF variant, data mixture), \\(W\\) a benchmark score (MMLU, GPQA), \\(Y\\) a deployment KPI (task success, time\u2011to\u2011completion, safety violations). Your experience\u2014excellent \\(W\\), disappointing \\(Y\\)\u2014fits three canonical channels:\n\n1. **Order failure (Theorem 1\u20132):** Past some capability level, changes that most increase \\(W\\) are not those that most increase \\(Y\\) (benchmark saturates or rewards spurious features).\n\n2. **Regressional selection (Theorem 3):** \u201cSOTA by leaderboard shopping\u201d: among many small training variants, the one with the best \\(W\\) owes some of that to noise; \\(Y\\) regresses.\n\n3. **Surrogate paradox (Theorem 4):** A training change increases benchmark\u2011specific skills but degrades behaviors that matter in deployment (e.g., robustness, tool\u2011use reliability); within benchmark strata, the training change directly harms \\(Y\\).\n\nYou can *demonstrate each channel* on toy tasks (spurious features, covariate shift) without touching proprietary data.\n\n---\n\n## E. Minimal simulation templates (all fast)\n\n1. **Order\u2011safety heatmap (Thm 1\u20132):**  \n   \\(f(x)=x\\), \\(g(x)=x+\\alpha\\sin(10x)\\) on a grid; plot fraction of pairwise order violations vs \\(\\alpha\\). Then switch to distributional policies and show that only \\(g(x)=ax+b\\) yields global expectation safety.\n\n2. **Goodhart regression curve (Thm 3):**  \n   Simulate bivariate normals for \\(\\rho\\in\\{0.2,0.5,0.8\\}\\). For quantiles \\(q\\in[0.90,0.999]\\), estimate \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y\\mid W\\ge q]\\) and \\(\\mathbb{E}[W\\mid W\\ge q]\\). Fit slope; verify it equals \\(\\rho\\sigma_Y/\\sigma_W\\) within Monte Carlo error.\n\n3. **Surrogate paradox table (Thm 4):**  \n   Sample from the 2\u00d72\u00d72 construction above and report: \\(\\Delta W>0\\), \\(\\mathrm{assoc}(W,Y)>0\\) in each arm, but \\(\\Delta Y<0\\).\n\n4. **LLM\u2011flavored toy:**  \n   Binary classification with two features \\((s, r)\\) where \\(r\\) is a \u201cspurious\u201d benchmark\u2011only cue (correlated with the label in benchmark data, independent in deployment). Train a linear classifier on benchmark; measure \\(W=\\) benchmark accuracy and \\(Y=\\) deployment accuracy. Vary the spurious correlation strength; plot \\(W\\) up, \\(Y\\) down. This instantiates Theorem 1\u20132 (order failure via shift).\n\n(Use antithetic variates or Sobol sequences to shrink error bars for (2); importance sampling to estimate very high\u2011quantile conditioning efficiently.)\n\n---\n\n## F. What this buys you (as theory)\n\n- A **definition** of Goodhartization in terms of *policy\u2011order reversals*.\n- **Sharp characterizations** of when Goodhart cannot occur (monotone/affine structure) and when it must (any deviation from those structures).\n- **Quantitative laws** (regression curve, winner\u2019s curse scaling) that you can verify on tiny simulations.\n- A **causal construction** (surrogate paradox) showing exactly how \u201coptimizing the benchmark\u201d can harm the outcome even when the benchmark is positively associated with the outcome.\n\nThat\u2019s more than an empirical slogan\u2014it\u2019s a compact theorem set you can prove, teach, and illustrate without going anywhere near messy real\u2011world data."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":9625,"end_idx":9625,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"wfr_019a9ce1f4d679bf8869db4e730be993","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","is_async_task_result_message":true,"async_task_id":"promode_691dec03d02c8191a66ea7d54d16c4bb","async_task_title":"","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_original_message_id":"70f308b2-a8c0-468e-a946-62ecb1b88e54","async_completion_id":"promode_691dec03d02c8191a66ea7d54d16c4bb","async_completion_message":"Your detailed exploration and stress test of Goodhart's Law, especially in relation to LLM benchmarks versus real-world performance, is ready to read.

Actions that optimize A may fail to improve B, as A isn't the cause of B. This fits with theories like regressional Goodhart. I'll use prior concepts we discussed to provide a nuanced, forward-looking answer, critiquing further.\n\n**Expanding on Goodhart's Law with more nuance**\n\nThe idea of correlation vs causation fits Goodhart\u2019s Law but doesn\u2019t cover all aspects. Factors like regressional and extremal Goodhart highlight distribution shifts. Also, optimizing A might lead to undesirable effects like the Cobra effect or measurement manipulation, breaking the relationship with B due to constraints, non-linearities, and externalities.\n\n**Clarifying conditions for safe targeting in Goodhart\u2019s Law**\n\nTargeting A can be safe if A is monotone, causal, and not confounded, or if W is a simple function of Y. Policy monotonicity, where expected outcomes increase with policy adjustments, is key. Pearl\u2019s criteria for surrogate endpoint validity also apply, showing that Goodhart generalizes beyond correlation.\n\n**Understanding benchmarks and misalignment in training**\n\nBenchmarks themselves aren't inherently causal; they're just measures. However, training procedures affect internal states, and if optimization leads to overfitting or misalignment between the training objective and real tasks, performance on benchmarks may not translate well to deployment\u2014even if correlation existed before optimization.\n\n**Clarifying the scope of Goodhart\u2019s Law related to benchmarks**\n\nYes, the user\u2019s view aligns with causal Goodhart and the surrogate paradox. However, Goodhart also extends to cases where A causes B, but optimization may fail due to factors like noise, distribution shifts, or strategic responses. Theorems 1-2 address order-preservation and affine equivalence, not strict causality.\n\n**Discussing Goodhartization and theorems**\n\nIf A is the target variable and B equals Y, Theorem 1 provides necessary and sufficient conditions for avoiding Goodhartization in a deterministic policy. For this, g must be monotone in f. Even with correlation present, there are many ways in which Goodhartization can still occur.\n\n**Clarifying Goodhartization, causation vs correlation**\n\nTheorems 1-4 explain Goodhartization, with the main idea being that even when A causes B, optimizing for A can backfire due to distribution shift, measurement changes, or indirect effects. \"Correlation not causation\" is insufficient since real-world complexities like nonlinearities or externalities can derail optimization. Even with perfect correlation, changes outside the observed relationship can cause issues. For LLMs, defining robust benchmark conditions might be key to avoiding safety issues.\n\n**Clarifying regressional Goodhart and causality**\n\nShort answer: Partly, but it's incomplete.\n\n1. Yes, causal mismatch is a common issue, and it's related to the surrogate paradox.  \n2. Even when A causes B or W is monotone in Y, Goodhartization can still happen due to noise selection or distribution shifts.  \n3. In LLM benchmarking, correlation vs causation alone isn't enough; factors like overfitting and leakage matter.  \n4. We need to establish clear mathematical conditions to avoid Goodhartization, refining how these conditions apply in various contexts."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 3m 8s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"Request for GPT-5 Pro","async_source":"saserver-centralindia-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-aab88183-e853-4fe8-9395-5d88c77e99b2:IN","parent_id":"f3379d6f-17f3-43bb-b23b-d2a1d5267f7e","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":30,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_692e5c93eb788191a72ede5359ffe5f9","async_task_conversation_id":"692e5c93-ebc4-8324-b04e-c0bf217132bd","async_task_created_at":"2025-12-02T03:27:16.445505Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"f3379d6f-17f3-43bb-b23b-d2a1d5267f7e","request_id":"aab88183-e853-4fe8-9395-5d88c77e99b2","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","turn_exchange_id":"e6ffa261-7668-4ba6-ab40-f6cdf6bd17be","finished_duration_sec":188,"pro_skipped":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f3379d6f-17f3-43bb-b23b-d2a1d5267f7e","children":["dcf2d655-923b-427a-8b6a-ed999c581a07"]},"dcf2d655-923b-427a-8b6a-ed999c581a07":{"id":"dcf2d655-923b-427a-8b6a-ed999c581a07","message":{"id":"dcf2d655-923b-427a-8b6a-ed999c581a07","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764646036.7530599,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"async_task_id":"promode_692e5c93eb788191a72ede5359ffe5f9","async_task_type":"pro_mode","request_id":"aab88183-e853-4fe8-9395-5d88c77e99b2","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","parent_id":"9ae82520-1bbb-4fa1-bc94-f44a606130fc","turn_exchange_id":"e6ffa261-7668-4ba6-ab40-f6cdf6bd17be"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9ae82520-1bbb-4fa1-bc94-f44a606130fc","children":["d6d7911f-b592-4205-9cef-404800d476bb"]},"d6d7911f-b592-4205-9cef-404800d476bb":{"id":"d6d7911f-b592-4205-9cef-404800d476bb","message":{"id":"d6d7911f-b592-4205-9cef-404800d476bb","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764646225.109734,"update_time":1764646079.331496,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Short answer: **your framing matches one important branch of Goodhart\u2019s law (the *causal/surrogate* case), but it doesn\u2019t cover the full phenomenon.** Goodhart failures can happen even when the targeted variable *does* causally affect the true goal, and even when there is no confounding\u2014because optimization itself changes the distribution you operate in, amplifies noise, or incentivizes manipulation of the measurement process.\n\nBelow is a tight map showing where your \u201ccorrelation \u2260 causation\u201d account fits, and where it\u2019s insufficient.

Each admits a simple theorem and toy world.\n\n### (a) **Regressional Goodhart** (selection on noise)\nEven if \\(A\\) equals \\(B\\) plus noise (so \\(A\\) *does* causally reflect \\(B\\) in expectation), chasing high \\(A\\) selects positive noise realizations.\n\n- **Theorem (Gaussian shrinkage).** If \\((A,B)\\) are bivariate normal with correlation \\(\\rho\\in(0,1)\\),\n  \\[\n  \\mathbb{E}[B\\mid A=w]=\\rho\\frac{\\sigma_B}{\\sigma_A}\\,w,\\quad\n  \\mathbb{E}[B\\mid A\\ge t]=\\rho\\frac{\\sigma_B}{\\sigma_A}\\,\\mathbb{E}[A\\mid A\\ge t].\n  \\]\n  The slope is strictly \\(<1\\) unless \\(\\rho=1\\), so extreme \\(A\\) **overstates** improvements in \\(B\\).  \n  *Toy demo:* simulate \\((A,B)\\) with various \\(\\rho\\); plot \\(\\mathbb{E}[B\\mid A\\ge t]\\) vs \\(\\mathbb{E}[A\\mid A\\ge t]\\): a straight line with slope \\(\\rho\\sigma_B/\\sigma_A\\).\n\n- **Winner\u2019s\u2011curse variant.** Picking the best of \\(N\\) variants by \\(A\\) yields \\(\\mathbb{E}[B]\\) that grows only by the same shrinkage factor, so the \\(A\\)\u2013\\(B\\) gap widens with \\(N\\).  \n  *Toy demo:* simulate \\(N\\) i.i.d. pairs, take \\(\\arg\\max A\\), record \\(B\\), repeat.\n\n**Implication for LLMs.** Leaderboard selection among many small training runs produces inflated benchmark gains with much smaller (or nil) real\u2011task gains\u2014even when the benchmark genuinely tracks capability in expectation.\n\n---\n\n### (b) **Extremal Goodhart** (distribution shift under optimization)\nA proxy can be valid *locally* but fail when you optimize it into regions you never calibrated.\n\n- **Order\u2011safety (deterministic policies).** No Goodhart occurs *iff* \\(g\\) (the proxy) **preserves the order** of \\(f\\) (the true objective) over the *entire* action domain:\n  \\[\n  (f(x_1)-f(x_2))(g(x_1)-g(x_2))\\ge 0\\quad\\forall x_1,x_2.\n  \\]\n  If this fails anywhere (often in the tails), a policy can raise \\(A\\) while lowering \\(B\\).  \n  *Toy demo:* \\(f(x)=x\\), \\(g(x)=x+\\alpha\\sin(10x)\\); violations explode past a critical \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n- **Expectation\u2011safety (distributional policies).** If you allow arbitrary mixtures over actions, the only globally safe proxies are **affine** transforms of the truth: \\(g=af+b\\), \\(a>0\\). Any nonlinearity permits mixtures that raise \\(\\mathbb{E}[A]\\) while lowering \\(\\mathbb{E}[B]\\).  \n  *Toy demo:* \\(f(X)=X\\); compare two distributions with equal mean but different variance under \\(g(f)=f^3\\); the proxy ranking flips while the true mean stays fixed.\n\n**Implication for LLMs.** Optimizing a benchmark can push the model into styles of reasoning or data regions where the benchmark\u2019s *implicit* assumptions don\u2019t hold (e.g., distributional artifacts), so gains in the benchmark cease to predict real\u2011task gains.\n\n---\n\n### (c) **Adversarial/measurement Goodhart** (gaming the metric)\nOptimization pressure targets the *measurement channel* rather than the underlying capability.\n\n- **Measurement tampering.** Let two proxies track \\(B\\): \\(W_1=a_1 f+b_1+\\epsilon_1\\), \\(W_2=a_2 f+b_2+\\epsilon_2\\). If policy changes alter \\(W_1\\) (through rubric, leakage, contamination) but not \\(f\\) or \\(W_2\\), you can formally detect this via an **invariance** test (pre/post calibration of \\(W_1\\) on \\(W_2\\)).  \n  *Toy demo:* precompute \\(\\hat W_1\\approx \\alpha+\\beta W_2\\), then show that post\u2011policy residuals shift while \\(B\\) is unchanged.\n\n**Implication for LLMs.** Overfitting to benchmark formats, exploiting train\u2013test overlap, or fine\u2011tuning to annotation quirks raises scores without increasing real\u2011world competence.\n\n---\n\n## 3) How this reframes your statement\n\nYour causal story is **one quadrant** of a four\u2011part picture:\n\n1) **Causal/surrogate Goodhart** (your account): A doesn\u2019t cause B (or isn\u2019t a sufficient mediator) \u21d2 optimizing A needn\u2019t help B.  \n2) **Regressional Goodhart**: A \u2248 B + noise \u21d2 selecting large A picks noise \u21d2 overstated gains.  \n3) **Extremal (distribution\u2011shift) Goodhart**: local alignment breaks at the tails or off\u2011manifold \u21d2 optimizing A moves you where A no longer tracks B.  \n4) **Adversarial/measurement Goodhart**: optimization targets the proxy\u2011measurement pipeline rather than capability \u21d2 A rises, B stalls or falls.\n\nAll four are rigorously expressible, and each has \u201cno\u2011Goodhart\u201d conditions:\n\n- **Causal safety:** A is a *strong surrogate* (monotone, causally sufficient mediator; \\(S\\) affects \\(B\\) only via \\(A\\)).  \n- **Regressional safety:** \\(\\rho=1\\) (no noise) or use procedures that neutralize selection\u2011on\u2011noise (e.g., martingale/e\u2011value designs in sequential settings).  \n- **Extremal safety:** global order preservation (or the stronger affine condition for mixture policies).  \n- **Adversarial safety:** metric\u2011integrity constraints (invariance checks, tamper\u2011resistant eval design, reusable holdouts).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Bottom line\n\n- **Yes**, your \u201ccorrelation vs causation\u201d explanation captures a central failure mode (surrogates/biomarkers/benchmarks).  \n- **No**, it\u2019s **not sufficient** as a foundational account. Goodhartization can appear with *no* confounding and even when the target *causally* tracks the goal, because optimization interacts with noise, tails, and incentives.\n\nIf you want to keep a theory\u2011first line and illustrate with toy Monte Carlo:\n\n- Prove the **order/affine safety theorems** (no Goodhart iff monotone/affine).  \n- Show **regressional shrinkage** and the **winner\u2019s curse**.  \n- Build the **surrogate paradox** 2\u00d72\u00d72 table.  \n- Add a **twin\u2011proxy invariance test** to catch measurement tampering.\n\nThose four pieces together give you a precise, mathematical \u201cbedrock\u201d for Goodhart\u2019s law that subsumes the causal\u2011correlation intuition but isn\u2019t limited by it."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"wfr_019add19a70b703684996863f99fe420","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","is_async_task_result_message":true,"async_task_id":"promode_692e5c93eb788191a72ede5359ffe5f9","async_task_title":"","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_original_message_id":"f3379d6f-17f3-43bb-b23b-d2a1d5267f7e","async_completion_id":"promode_692e5c93eb788191a72ede5359ffe5f9","async_completion_message":"Your explanation of Goodhart's Law as fundamentally stemming from the correlation-versus-causation mismatch aligns well with current interpretations. Goodhart's Law warns that once a proxy metric (A) \u2014 correlated but not causally linked to the true target (B) \u2014 is used as a target for optimization, it tends to lose its reliability as an indicator. This occurs because optimizing A through actions S affects A directly but does not necessarily improve B unless those actions genuinely cause B to improve. Contemporary research expands on this by categorizing Goodhart effects (e.g., regressional, causal, adversarial) and emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying causal structures rather than relying solely on correlated proxies. So yes, your framing gels with current thinking and highlights why causal understanding is critical to avoid pitfalls when optimizing proxy measures.  \n\nBy the way, your explanation and alignment with Goodhart\u2019s Law is ready to review.

They mentioned focusing on theory and toy data, and I need to make sure to include up-to-date recommendations. I'll gather the list of relevant papers and confirm details through reliable sources.\n\n**Considering web tool usage for reading list and citations**\n\nSince the web tool has word limits and summary requirements, I must be careful with citations and crafting the reading list. I\u2019ll focus on key topics from the Goodhart\u2019s Law taxonomy, surrogate endpoints literature, and selective inference. I'll include citations while keeping these categories concise and well-organized.\n\n**Confirming details and including relevant AI context**\n\nI\u2019m wondering if Hardt and Blum\u2019s \"Ladder\" refers to \"The Ladder: A Reliable Leaderboard\" or \"A New Approach to Online Validation.\" I'd better verify to ensure accuracy. I'll also include relevant papers on LLM benchmarking, Goodhartization, and AI testing methods. These will help provide solid context for the user\u2019s theory-first reading list.\n\n**Proposing research papers and context for theory-first reading list**\n\nSince the user wants a theory-first reading list, I\u2019ll include key AI papers and cite relevant research. I'll also suggest my own papers to write (Paper A, B, C), based on earlier directions, and identify which existing literature should be referenced or built upon to move forward with the research direction.\n\n**Setting up search queries for accurate citations**\n\nTo get accurate citations, I'll set up search queries for topics such as:\n- Manheim & Garrabrant\u2019s Goodhart taxonomy, and related work like El-Mhamdi & Hoang on Goodhart\u2019s Law.\n- Surrogate endpoints, including Prentice, Freedman, and Pearl.\n- Selective inference, looking up Berk et al. and Fithian et al.\n- Knockoff methods by Barber & Cand\u00e8s, and others.\nThese will help confirm the latest details and provide reliable references.\n\n**Finding robust sources for key concepts**\n\nTo gather reliable sources, I\u2019ll focus on:\n- Online FDR, with references like Javanmard & Montanari (2015) and Ramdas et al. (2018).\n- Adaptive data analysis, including Dwork et al. (2015) on reusable holdout.\n- Ladder mechanism by Blum & Hardt (2015).\n- Winner\u2019s curse, especially Smith & Winkler (2006) and Efron\u2019s works (2010, 2011). \n- Registered reports, referring to Chambers and recent meta-analyses.\n\n**Reviewing key studies in statistical analysis and AI**\n\nTo check relevant sources for research:\n- P-hacking: Simmons et al. (2011) and Head et al. (2015).\n- Optional stopping: Armitage (1969) and Pocock (1977).\n- DP/stability generalization: Dwork et al. (2015) on generalization and holdout techniques.\n- AI-related Goodhart issues: Krakovna's blog, Murphy\u2019s law, and references for robustness in alignment.\n- LLM evaluation: Highlighting benchmarks like Dynabench and BIG-bench.\n\n**Flagging gaps and suggesting key research directions**\n\nThey want a comprehensive consolidation, so I\u2019ll categorize the papers and explain their focus. I'll also highlight the key research gaps that should inspire future work. For instance, we could point to gaps like \"missing theorems\" in adaptivity, robust FDR with corrupted p-values, and DP vs. e-process equivalence.\n\n**Starting with surrogate endpoints**\n\nOkay, it looks like I\u2019m on the right track with surrogate endpoints. I\u2019m thinking about the foundational ideas and setting up appropriate context to explore them further. I\u2019ll keep refining those ideas to build a better understanding or framework as we go.\n\n**Looking at tampering detection and invariance**\n\nFor tampering detection with measurement invariance, I have concepts like \"Invariant Risk Minimization\" (IRM) by Arjovsky et al. and \"Invariant Causal Prediction\" (ICP) by Peters et al. There might not be a direct paper on tampering via twin proxies, but I can point to related ideas like \u201cmetamorphic testing\u201d and \u201cconsistency checks.\u201d\n\n**Focusing on academic sources for citation**\n\nSince some of the sources I've found come from blogs or media, I'll prioritize citing academic sources. These tend to be more reliable and rigorous, ensuring I'm referencing solid, well-established research whenever possible. That should help maintain the credibility of any information I provide.\n\n**Assembling the reading list by category**\n\nI\u2019m organizing the reading list by categories: \n\nA. Foundations: Goodhart Taxonomy by Manheim & Garrabrant, El-Mhamdi & Hoang.  \nB. Proxy measurements: Prentice 1989, Freedman et al. 1992, Baker et al. 2017, Tian/Pearl, Hsiao/Tian 2025.  \nC. Causality & invariance: Pearl 2010, ICP, Anchor regression, IRM, DRO (Duchi & Namkoong 2018, Rahimian & Mehrotra 2019).\n\nNow, I\u2019ll proceed to gather these sources.\n\n**Finalizing reading list and structure**\n\nWe're nearing the browsing limit, so it\u2019s time to wrap up. I need to assemble the reading list with categories and citations, including the 5 most important points backed by sources. Each paper should be bullet-pointed with a reason, and I'd also note what to write next, proposed titles, and key datasets. We'll organize it by Foundations, Theories, Tools, etc. This will keep it concise and structured for reference. No need for a navigation list since it's just for news.

Affine\u2011necessity for expectation\u2011safety (distributional policies)**\n**Thesis.** For arbitrary policy\u2011induced distributions, \u201craising \\(\\mathbb{E}[A]\\) guarantees raising \\(\\mathbb{E}[B]\\)\u201d **iff** \\(B=\\alpha A+\\beta+U\\) with \\(\\alpha>0\\) and \\(U\\) mean\u2011zero independent of policy.  \n**Deliverables.**  \n- Necessity proof via Jensen/mixture counterexamples.  \n- Sufficient conditions using **FOSD**: if \\(A\\) under \\(\\pi_1\\) FOSD\u2011dominates \\(A\\) under \\(\\pi_2\\) and \\(B=h(A,U)\\) with \\(h\\) nondecreasing, then \\(\\mathbb{E}[B]\\) ordering holds.  \n- **Toy MC:** two distributions with equal \\(\\mathbb{E}[A]\\) but different variance; show flip for nonlinear \\(h\\).\n\n### **P2. Deterministic\u2011policy safety \u21d4 order preservation (clean IFF)**\n**Thesis.** With point\u2011mass policies, Goodhart is impossible **iff** \\(g\\) preserves the order of \\(f\\) on the feasible set; equivalently, \\(g=\\phi\\!\\circ\\! f\\) with strictly increasing \\(\\phi\\).  \n**Toy MC:** \\(f(x)=x\\); \\(g(x)=x+\\alpha\\sin(10x)\\); violation\u2011rate heatmaps vs \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n### **P3. Regressional Goodhart curves & winner\u2019s\u2011curse scaling**\n**Thesis.** In the joint\u2011normal toy, conditioning on \\(A\\) or picking \\(\\max A\\) yields deterministic shrinkage \\(\\alpha=\\rho\\,\\sigma_B/\\sigma_A\\). Extend to sub\u2011Gaussian by concentration.  \n**Toy MC:** plot \\(\\mathbb{E}[B\\mid A\\ge t]\\) vs \\(\\mathbb{E}[A\\mid A\\ge t]\\); show linear slope; show growth of the gap with \\(N\\) trials.\n\n### **P4. Surrogate paradox: tight bounds & minimal conditions**\n**Thesis.** Characterize necessary/sufficient conditions preventing the paradox: (i) **no direct effect** \\(S\\to B\\); (ii) **monotone** \\(B\\) in \\(A\\); (iii) **distributional dominance** of \\(A\\). Provide **sharp bounds** on \\(\\Delta B\\) given \\(\\Delta A\\) and violation magnitudes.  \n**Toy MC:** canonical 2\u00d72\u00d72 table + stress tests.\n\n### **P5. Twin\u2011proxy invariance tests for measurement tampering**\n**Thesis.** If two proxies share the same latent \\(f(X)\\), then the pre/post regression \\(W_1 \\approx \\alpha+\\beta W_2\\) is invariant absent tampering. Build a test (and a sequential CUSUM) with finite\u2011sample validity.  \n**Toy MC:** Type\u2011I and power curves as you vary noise correlation and sample size.\n\n### **P6. Bridging stability (DP) and test\u2011martingales (e\u2011values)**\n**Thesis.** Give a formal connection: conditions under which DP\u2011style stability implies existence of nontrivial e\u2011processes for adaptive sequences of evaluations\u2014and conversely, when e\u2011process control yields generalization guarantees.  \n**Toy MC:** adaptive\u2011query toy where both sides apply; compare finite\u2011sample constants.\n\n### **P7. Robust online FDR under mildly invalid p\u2011values (or e\u2011values)**\n**Thesis.** Replace \u201csuper\u2011uniform p\u2011values\u201d by \\(\\mathbb{P}(p\\le t)\\le t+\\delta\\) or by e\u2011values with bounded inflation. Provide procedures that maintain **meaningful** FDR guarantees.  \n**Toy MC:** streams with a tunable contamination level \\(\\delta\\); plot empirical FDR vs target.\n\n---\n\n# Reading order (minimal path)\n\n1. **Pearl** (surrogate paradox chapters) **+** **Prentice/VanderWeele** (surrogate criteria).  \n2. **Smith & Winkler** **+** **Efron** (selection & winner\u2019s curse).  \n3. **Shafer/Vovk** **+** **Howard/Ramdas** (e\u2011values, confidence sequences).  \n4. **Javanmard & Montanari** **+** **Ramdas (SAFFRON)** (online FDR).  \n5. **Berk/Fithian/Lee\u2013Taylor** (selective inference).  \n6. **Dwork et\u202fal.** (adaptive data analysis).  \n7. **Peters et\u202fal.** (invariance) **+** **change\u2011point** references (for tampering detection).\n\n---\n\n## How each strand feeds your papers\n\n- **P1/P2** draw directly from *convexity/order* arguments (Sections B\u2013C).  \n- **P3** uses *bivariate\u2011normal calculus* and sub\u2011Gaussian concentration (C).  \n- **P4** relies on *causal mediation/partial identification* (B).  \n- **P5** uses *measurement invariance + change\u2011point* (H).  \n- **P6** stitches *stability* (G) to *martingales* (D).  \n- **P7** blends *online FDR* (E) with *e\u2011values* (D) and *robust stats*.\n\n---\n\n### Final note on scope\n\nThis list is intentionally **theory\u2011centric** and **simulation\u2011friendly**.
