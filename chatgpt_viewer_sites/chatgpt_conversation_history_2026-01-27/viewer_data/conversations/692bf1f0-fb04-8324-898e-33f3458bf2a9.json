downgrades China Vanke, says its financial commitments unsustainable","snippet":"S&P Global has downgraded China Vanke, a major Chinese property developer, to CCC- from CCC, citing unsustainable financial commitments and deteriorating liquidity. The downgrade follows a sharp drop in Vanke\u2019s bond and stock prices after reports of potential debt restructuring. Vanke, partially owned by the state-backed Shenzhen Metro, is now seeking to delay repayment of a 2 billion yuan onshore bond due in December, a move that raises concerns about its ability to meet a looming \u201cbond maturity wall\u201d of 11.4 billion yuan by May 2026. S&P also placed Vanke on CreditWatch with negative implications, projecting negative operating cash flow.\n\nThe downgrade comes amidst ongoing turmoil in China\u2019s real estate sector, which has faced a liquidity crisis since 2021. Though the government has emphasized completion of pre-sold homes, support for developers like Vanke remains uncertain. Vanke\u2019s total interest-bearing liabilities stand at 364.3 billion yuan, and it reported a Q3 net loss of 16.1 billion yuan. Market reactions included bond trading suspensions and stocks hitting record lows, reflecting widespread investor anxiety. The situation echoes past collapses, including China Evergrande's court-ordered liquidation, deepening concerns about broader sector instability.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1764312299.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-vanke-bonds-slump-concerns-mount-over-state-support-2025-11-26/","title":"China Vanke bonds slump as concerns mount over state support","snippet":"Chinese property developer Vanke, partially owned by Shenzhen Metro Group, saw its bonds plummet by over 20% on November 26, 2025, triggering trading suspensions on five exchange-traded bonds. This sharp decline has revived investor fears about the lack of strong central government support for the struggling real estate sector amid persistent deflationary pressures post-COVID. In October, new home prices in China fell at their fastest rate in a year, signaling continued weak housing demand. Vanke\u2019s bond due in March 2027 dropped nearly 30% by midday, a steep reversal from earlier this year when bond values rebounded on hopes of government intervention. Market analyst Yao Yu noted that while Shenzhen may be seeking Beijing's help, it's unclear whether further support will come. Although Vanke recently announced a potential 22 billion yuan ($3.09 billion) loan from Shenzhen Metro, the broader policy environment remains cautious, with no new large-scale stimulus introduced in 2025. As a result, Vanke's onshore shares have declined to their lowest levels since 2008, while its Hong Kong shares are also down nearly 3%.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1764132829.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/3a675f7f-ff46-4b8d-9744-08dfed18d23a","title":"Ageing populations will lead to lower living standards, warns study","snippet":"A report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) warns that ageing populations in Europe and other regions will lead to declining living standards and lower GDP per capita growth. The study highlights that emerging European economies\u2014such as Poland, Bulgaria, and Slovenia\u2014face average annual reductions in GDP per capita growth of nearly 0.4 percentage points between 2024 and 2050 due to shrinking working-age populations and low fertility rates. Advanced economies like South Korea, Italy, Spain, China, Japan, and Germany will also be strongly impacted. With older voters gaining influence, governments are increasingly struggling to implement needed reforms such as raising retirement ages or boosting immigration. The report notes that public opinion heavily favors healthcare and pension spending over education, further complicating long-term strategies. While artificial intelligence might help partially mitigate productivity losses, it cannot fully offset demographic challenges. The EBRD urges immediate action, emphasizing that post-communist countries are ageing before achieving high levels of wealth, and current policy decisions will heavily impact younger generations in the decades to come.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1764050410.613,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.imf.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/publications/weo/issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024","title":"World Economic Outlook, October 2024: Policy Pivot, ...","snippet":"22 Oct 2024 \u2014 Five years from now, global growth should reach 3.1 percent\u2014a mediocre performance compared with the prepandemic average.

populations will lead to lower living standards, warns study","snippet":"A report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) warns that ageing populations in Europe and other regions will lead to declining living standards and lower GDP per capita growth. The study highlights that emerging European economies\u2014such as Poland, Bulgaria, and Slovenia\u2014face average annual reductions in GDP per capita growth of nearly 0.4 percentage points between 2024 and 2050 due to shrinking working-age populations and low fertility rates. Advanced economies like South Korea, Italy, Spain, China, Japan, and Germany will also be strongly impacted. With older voters gaining influence, governments are increasingly struggling to implement needed reforms such as raising retirement ages or boosting immigration. The report notes that public opinion heavily favors healthcare and pension spending over education, further complicating long-term strategies. While artificial intelligence might help partially mitigate productivity losses, it cannot fully offset demographic challenges. The EBRD urges immediate action, emphasizing that post-communist countries are ageing before achieving high levels of wealth, and current policy decisions will heavily impact younger generations in the decades to come.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1764050410.613,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/senegal-announces-improved-debt-figure-with-rebased-gdp-2025-11-26/","title":"Senegal announces improved debt figure with rebased GDP","snippet":"Senegal has recalculated its gross domestic product (GDP) using 2021 as the new base year instead of 2014, resulting in an improved debt-to-GDP ratio. The updated 2021 GDP is now 17,316 billion CFA francs, a 13.5% increase from previous estimates, which brings the public debt ratio down from 90.8% to 80%. The recalculation incorporates emerging sectors like digital financial services, oil and gas, and cashew production. This economic update comes amid a crisis over unreported debt and follows a recent downgrade by S&P Global, which rated Senegal\u2019s long-term sovereign credit at \"CCC+\" and placed it on \u201cCreditWatch developing.\u201d S&P had cited a debt-to-GDP ratio of nearly 120% at the end of 2024. Senegal\u2019s finance ministry argued the downgrade did not factor in the rebased figures. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has suspended a $1.8 billion program due to the hidden debt, primarily attributed to the former administration. While the IMF stated that GDP rebasing is not essential for a new program, no immediate further comment has been provided.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1764150335.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ageing-populations-ticking-time-bomb-gdp-growth-says-ebrd-2025-11-25/","title":"Ageing populations a 'ticking time bomb' for GDP growth, says EBRD","snippet":"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has warned that ageing populations pose a serious threat to future GDP growth, particularly in emerging Europe. In its annual report, the EBRD projects that a shrinking working-age population could reduce annual per capita GDP growth by an average of 0.4 percentage points from 2024 to 2050. EBRD Chief Economist Beata Javorcik emphasized that demographic shifts are already reducing living standards and will increasingly hinder economic performance. Many post-communist nations now face the challenge of ageing before achieving high income levels, with inadequate birth rates and limited political support for compensating measures like increased migration or AI-driven productivity. The most viable solution appears to be extending working lives, supported by retraining and pension reform. Additionally, older political leaders and electorates tend to resist necessary reforms. The report also highlights a brief opportunity for younger, growing nations such as Nigeria to benefit from a demographic dividend, which may quickly vanish as birth rates decline.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1764064732.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.imf.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2025/09/17/global-debt-remains-above-235-of-world-gdp","title":"Global Debt Remains Above 235% of World GDP","snippet":"17 Sept 2025 \u2014 Total debt was little changed last year, just above 235 percent of global gross domestic product, according to the latest update of the IMF's ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.imf.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/the-costs-of-geoeconomic-fragmentation-bolhuis-chen-kett","title":"The Costs of Geoeconomic Fragmentation-Bolhuis-Chen-Kett","snippet":"The world's two largest economies, the United States and China, have imposed a series of bilateral trade barriers in recent years.

In a speech in Bratislava, Lagarde pointed out that the U.S. and China are already investing heavily in AI, potentially setting the stage for a major technological transformation. She emphasized that Europe has missed the opportunity to be a first mover and could face long-term consequences similar to those from its slow adoption of previous digital technologies.\n\nLagarde stressed that simply purchasing AI technology from foreign providers will increase dependency and vulnerability, and called for diversification in essential AI infrastructure such as compute capacity, chips, and data centers. To foster growth, she urged the EU to enforce open standards, improve energy affordability, streamline regulation across member states, and create an integrated capital market to finance innovation. Her message highlights the urgency for the EU to remove barriers and accelerate its AI capabilities to remain competitive globally.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1763995653.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/82100215-18d0-4850-8dcd-d9745ad342d0","title":"'Fomo' is driving 'stretched' US tech valuations, ECB warns","snippet":"The European Central Bank (ECB) has issued a warning in its latest Financial Stability Review regarding the \"stretched\" valuations of US tech stocks, including companies like Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta. The high valuations are being driven by investor \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO) and excessive optimism about the global implementation and success of artificial intelligence (AI). The ECB noted that current market pricing fails to reflect ongoing vulnerabilities and uncertainties amid a renewed risk-on sentiment post an April sell-off.\n\nWhile the ECB does not claim a bubble is forming, it cautions that a correction could occur if the optimistic AI scenario doesn't materialize. Unlike the dotcom boom of 2000, today\u2019s tech firms generally have strong business fundamentals, yet risks persist due to opaque private markets and potential liquidity pressures in European financial institutions. Additional concerns include US political interference with central bank independence, soaring US debt, and possible turmoil in the US Treasuries market\u2014risks that could impact global financial stability. The ECB also highlighted fiscal instability in some Eurozone countries, particularly France, as a threat to investor confidence and bond market stability.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1764147608.329,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.suerf.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.suerf.org/publications/suerf-policy-notes-and-briefs/macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence-in-g7-economies/","title":"Macroeconomic productivity gains from Artificial ...","snippet":"23 Oct 2025 \u2014 This policy brief presents findings from the paper by Filippucci et al.

ECB President Christine Lagarde cited escalating global trade tensions, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent announcement of high import tariffs, as a major threat to the eurozone economy. The tariffs, which include a 20% rate on EU goods and possible additional levies on autos and metals, have introduced significant uncertainty. Although Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days to allow negotiations, the situation remains volatile. The eurozone\u2019s economic growth was a modest 0.2% in late 2024, and inflation was at 2.2% in March, near the ECB's 2% target. In light of these factors, Lagarde stated that future rate decisions would depend on the evolving trade scenario.

The lawsuit underscores the intensifying geopolitical and commercial competition in the semiconductor industry, particularly as the U.S. boosts domestic chipmaking capabilities\u2014with the government investing $8.9 billion in Intel.\n\nLo, a highly experienced researcher in advanced semiconductor technologies, allegedly misrepresented his post-retirement intentions, claiming he would work in academia, not revealing plans to join Intel. Intel denies any wrongdoing, stating they have strict policies protecting intellectual property and believe the lawsuit lacks merit. This action follows similar legal efforts by TSMC to safeguard trade secrets from being transferred to competitors like SMIC, Samsung, and Tokyo Electron.

According to OECD econometric modeling, localizing supply chains through higher tariffs, domestic subsidies, and sourcing restrictions could reduce global trade by 18% and GDP by up to 12% in affected countries. Marion Jansen, OECD's trade and agriculture head, warned against overcorrecting from dependency on single trade partners to complete autarky, which could expose economies to internal shocks and inefficiencies. The study found that since the mid-1990s, dependency on China has risen significantly among OECD countries, particularly in advanced manufacturing sectors. China now serves as the dominant trading partner in 30% of highly concentrated import cases for these countries, up from 5% in the late 1990s. While some large non-OECD economies have one-sided dependencies on China, OECD member nations often have mutual dependencies. Importantly, the report concluded that reshoring does not enhance resilience, with over half the economies modeled becoming more vulnerable to economic volatility. Instead, the OECD recommends embracing openness and geographical trade diversification to better manage disruptions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1748854832.803,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/apr/22/us-dollar-yen-pound-gold-stock-markets-trump-attack-powell-imf-growth-forecast-business-live","title":"IMF slashes global growth forecast to 2.8% this year due to Trump trade war - as it happened","snippet":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slashed its global growth forecast for 2025 to 2.8%, down from 3.3%, citing the significant negative impact of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The IMF identified heightened trade tensions and policy uncertainty as major drivers of economic slowdowns across all major economies, reducing U.S. growth projections to 1.8% (from 2.7%) and the UK to 1.1% (from 1.6%). The organization also raised the probability of a U.S. recession to nearly 40% and warned of growing financial stability risks stemming from market volatility and high asset valuations.\n\nTrump\u2019s policies have destabilized markets, leading to a three-year low for the U.S. dollar and record high gold prices at $3,500 per ounce, as investors seek safer assets. Central bank independence, particularly that of the U.S. Federal Reserve, is under scrutiny as Trump intensifies pressure on Chair Jerome Powell. The IMF emphasized the need for global cooperation on trade and debt restructuring, warning that further escalation could trigger broader financial instability.

This loss would be due to the severe impacts of climate change, such as fires, flooding, droughts, and rising temperatures. The report, which follows data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service indicating that the global temperature exceeded the 1.5C target in 2024, calls for accelerated decarbonisation and restoration of nature to avoid catastrophic outcomes, including sociopolitical fragmentation and states' failure.

Despite significant job losses in automated and outsourced positions, roles demanding social fluency and physical presence increased. This shift has polarized the job market, benefiting high- and low-income workers and disproportionately affecting men in manual labor roles while women gained in social-skill-centric careers.

Baseline: where the world is headed *without* big surprises  \n2. Main upside drivers (with AI at the centre)  \n3. Major risk clusters  \n4. Asia-specific risks and contagion channels  \n5. How this nets out in 3 plausible 5\u201310-year scenarios  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Baseline: a slow-growth, high-debt, ageing world\n\n**Growth.** The International Monetary Fund (IMF) medium-term projections have global real gross domestic product (GDP) growth settling around **3.0\u20133.1%** a year\u2014below the pre-pandemic norm. Emerging Asia (China, India, ASEAN, etc.) is expected to supply **roughly 60% of global growth** in the near term.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search11\ue201\n\n**Debt and rates.** Global public and private debt has stabilised but at extremely high levels\u2014**about 235\u2013237% of world GDP**, with public debt near **93% of GDP** on average and much higher in advanced economies.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search16\ue201 After a sharp hiking cycle, policy rates have eased somewhat but the working assumption is **\u201chigher-for-longer\u201d real interest rates**, which the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and IMF both flag as a structural risk for banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) that built portfolios in a near-zero-rate world.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n\n**Demographics.** Ageing is a slow-moving but powerful drag. An EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) study estimates ageing trims about **0.4 percentage points** from annual per-capita GDP growth in emerging Europe, with advanced economies such as Germany, Italy, Spain, South Korea, Japan and China facing similar headwinds as their working-age populations shrink.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn1news42\ue201 Artificial intelligence (AI) can partially offset this via productivity, but not fully.\n\nSo the \u201cunperturbed\u201d trajectory is: **mediocre global growth + high debt + ageing**. AI is the one upside shock large enough to change that picture\u2014especially for Western economies.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Upside drivers \u2013 with AI front and centre\n\n### 2.1 AI as the main upside for Western economies\n\nThe serious macro work on AI is converging on: *this is big, but not magic, and highly path-dependent on adoption*.\n\n- A set of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and IMF-linked studies (Filippucci, Gal, Schief and co-authors) estimate that over roughly a **10-year horizon** AI could add  \n  - **0.4\u20131.3 percentage points** per year to labour productivity in the *most AI-exposed G7 economies* (e.g. US, UK, Canada), and  \n  - **0.2\u20130.8 percentage points** in less favourable cases (e.g. Japan, Italy).\ue200cite\ue202turn2search8\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search1\ue201  \n\n- McKinsey\u2019s work on generative AI suggests **$2.6\u20134.4 trillion of additional output per year** globally, implying roughly **0.1\u20130.6 percentage points extra labour productivity growth** annually through 2040 if adoption is reasonably fast.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n\n- Micro-evidence is strong: generative AI copilots have raised productivity **~14% for customer support agents** and up to **~40\u201355% faster** task completion for coding and writing tasks in controlled experiments.\ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn5search4\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn5search7\ue202turn5search16\ue201\n\nPut differently: if AI lifts trend productivity growth in the US and parts of Europe by even **0.5 percentage points per year** for a decade, that\u2019s **~5% higher GDP** in 10 years than the current baseline; at 1 percentage point, you\u2019re nearer **10%**. That is easily the difference between \u201csecular stagnation with ageing\u201d and \u201cdecent growth despite demographics.\u201d\n\n**Western positioning:**\n\n- **United States.** Owns much of the AI model frontier, cloud infrastructure and platform layer. The US has the highest exposure to AI-affectable tasks plus deep intangible capital (software, brands, data, management). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects AI to materially affect economic growth, employment patterns and the federal budget path.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search7\ue202turn2search15\ue201 If diffusion proceeds, the US is best placed for a genuine productivity step change.\n\n- **Europe and UK.** Christine Lagarde at the European Central Bank (ECB) explicitly frames AI as Europe\u2019s \u201cmoment to act\u201d, warning that the EU is *behind* the US and China in AI infrastructure (compute, chips, data centres) and risks missing a major technological wave as it did with prior digital tech.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn2news38\ue202turn2search2\ue201 IMF and ECB work show even lower-bound AI productivity gains would be a **\u201cgame changer\u201d** for Europe if adoption catches up.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search10\ue202turn2search14\ue201  \n\nIn a medium-range \u201cAI works\u201d scenario, you\u2019d expect by 2035:\n\n- US trend growth drifting from ~1.5\u20131.8% toward **~2\u20132.3%**,  \n- core European economies from ~1\u20131.2% toward **~1.4\u20131.7%**,  \n\nabsorbing some demographic drag rather than being crushed by it. That requires widespread adoption, workforce reskilling and supportive regulation; it is not automatic.\n\n### 2.2 Other structural tailwinds\n\nBeyond AI:\n\n- **Energy transition and new capex cycle.** The International Energy Agency (IEA) shows global **clean energy investment has surged and now exceeds fossil fuel investment**, driven by policy support and post-Ukraine energy security concerns.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search13\ue201 This means sustained demand for grids, renewables, storage, critical minerals and efficiency\u2014supporting capital formation globally.\n\n- **Rewiring of supply chains.** US-China tensions and Russia sanctions are re-routing trade flows. The IMF and OECD warn that *extreme* reshoring would be costly, but moderate diversification (Mexico, Eastern Europe, India, ASEAN) is already driving big new investment corridors.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search11\ue202turn4news20\ue201  \n\n- **Demographic dividends in select regions.** India, parts of ASEAN and Africa will still enjoy growing working-age populations over the next decade, providing demand and low-cost labour\u2014even as Europe, China, Japan and Korea age.\ue200cite\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn3search11\ue201  \n\nTogether with AI, these upside drivers are enough to lift the global path meaningfully *if* we avoid large negative shocks.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Major risk clusters (with an AI focus for the West)\n\n### 3.1 AI-specific risks to Western economies\n\n1. **Productivity \u201cmiracle\u201d may underdeliver.**  \n   Macro estimates are essentially **micro evidence \u00d7 adoption \u00d7 reallocation assumptions**. The OECD\u2019s *\u201cMiracle or Myth?\u201d* paper explicitly stresses that aggregate gains could be much smaller if firms adopt slowly or reorganisation is hard.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search9\ue202turn2search8\ue202turn2search12\ue201 The risk is a **dot-com-style overshoot**: valuations and capex are priced for high AI returns that don\u2019t fully materialise.\n\n2. **Asset-price bubble risk.**  \n   The ECB\u2019s latest financial stability work flags US mega-cap tech valuations as \u201cstretched\u201d and driven by **fear of missing out (FOMO) on AI**, warning that a correction is likely if the optimistic scenario disappoints or if rates re-price.\ue200cite\ue202turn2news39\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search11\ue201 A sharp tech correction would hit US household wealth, capex, and\u2014via index holdings\u2014the global financial system.\n\n3. **Labour market and inequality shock.**  \n   IMF and OECD research emphasise that AI will change *task composition* rather than just net job counts. Knowledge workers in routine cognitive roles (back-office, mid-tier professional services) are highly exposed; tasks may be automated faster than workers can transition, pushing inequality up and consumption growth down if policy does not redistribute some gains (training, wage insurance, better safety nets).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn2search15\ue202turn2search9\ue201 Politically, inequality + job insecurity is a straightforward recipe for populism and protectionism.\n\n4. **Regulatory over- or under-shoot.**  \n   - Over-tight regulation (or heavy compliance friction) could slow AI diffusion in the EU;  \n   - Under-regulation (e.g. on safety, misinformation, cyber-risk) could eventually trigger scandals or crises, leading to a more chaotic, punitive policy swing.\n\n5. **Energy and infrastructure bottlenecks.**  \n   High-end AI is **astonishingly energy- and compute-intensive**. If data centre build-out runs ahead of grid upgrades and clean generation, you could get regional power bottlenecks, higher electricity prices, and environmental backlash\u2014which then feed into political resistance to AI-related projects.\n\n### 3.2 Debt, financial stability and \u201chigher for longer\u201d\n\n- With global debt above **235% of GDP** and public debt around **93%**, the IMF warns that fiscal space is thin in many countries and that higher real rates stress both banks and NBFIs.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- The BIS highlights vulnerabilities particularly in **leveraged NBFIs with illiquid assets**, which benefited disproportionately from low rates.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search15\ue202turn3search16\ue201  \n- Combine this with **concentrated tech valuations** and you have a non-trivial risk of a financial shock triggered by:\n  - an AI-related equity repricing,\n  - a sovereign scare (for example US Treasuries or a large Eurozone country),\n  - or an Asian credit accident (see next section).\n\nIf such a shock hits before AI productivity gains are widely realised, the political system may turn against \u201cspeculative tech\u201d spending just as it did post-2000.\n\n### 3.3 Demographics and productivity drag\n\nThe demographic story is simple and grim:\n\n- Europe, China, Japan and South Korea are ageing rapidly, with shrinking working-age populations and rising old-age dependency ratios.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn1news42\ue201\n- Older electorates tend to resist reforms like raising retirement ages, increasing immigration, or shifting spending from pensions/health toward education and R&D.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn1news42\ue201  \n\nAI is the main way to \u201cfight arithmetic with arithmetic\u201d: if per-worker productivity rises fast enough, you can have rising living standards despite fewer workers. If AI underdelivers, the combination of ageing + high debt delivers a Japan-like low-growth equilibrium in much of the developed world.\n\n### 3.4 Geopolitics, fragmentation, climate\n\n- **Geoeconomic fragmentation.** IMF simulations show that severe trade fragmentation could cut **~2\u20133% of global GDP**; other estimates put the worst-case losses from deep trade and technology decoupling at **up to ~7% of global GDP**, with some highly exposed countries losing **8\u201312%** of GDP.\ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search1\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search7\ue202turn4search11\ue202turn4search8\ue202turn4search9\ue201  \n  - Trade between the US and China has clearly shrunk as a share of each side\u2019s total trade, even if full-blown \u201cbloc\u201d trade hasn\u2019t yet materialised.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn4search13\ue201  \n  - AI itself is a **fragmentation accelerant**: export controls on advanced chips, cloud restrictions and data localisation all push toward \u201cAI blocs\u201d with duplicated infrastructure and less efficient diffusion of know-how.\n\n- **Climate and energy transition.** Physical climate damage is more of a 20\u201350-year story, but the 5\u201310-year theme is **transition risk**\u2014policy uncertainty, stranded fossil assets and volatility in energy prices. The IEA\u2019s scenarios highlight that tight fossil investment plus surging demand (including from AI and electrification) could produce periodic price spikes if policy is inconsistent.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search13\ue202turn4news22\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Asia-specific risks and contagion channels\n\nAsia is both the **engine of global growth** and the **largest cluster of tail risks**.\n\n### 4.1 China: structural slowdown and property/balance-sheet stress\n\nKey facts:\n\n- China\u2019s property sector and related industries are still roughly **~19\u201325% of GDP**, down from ~30% at the peak, but enormous by any standard.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- The ongoing property crisis (Evergrande, Country Garden and now pressure on China Vanke) has slashed land-sale revenues, squeezed local governments, and raised the risk of broader credit strains.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0news40\ue202turn0news41\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n- Total Chinese debt reached **~289% of GDP** in 2023 and has continued rising, driven by public and quasi-public borrowing.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n\n**Contagion channels to the global / Western economy:**\n\n1. **Trade demand:** weaker Chinese growth depresses demand for European capital goods, German autos, luxury goods, and Asian supply-chain exports, as well as commodities (Australia, Brazil, Africa, Latin America), which then feed back into global manufacturing and investment cycles.  \n2. **Financial risk-off:** a disorderly property or local-government financing vehicle (LGFV) crisis would trigger global risk aversion, widen credit spreads and hit Western banks and asset managers with China exposure.  \n3. **Deflation export:** persistent Chinese price weakness could transmit disinflationary pressure through cheaper exports, complicating Western central banks\u2019 attempts to stabilise inflation and debt dynamics.\n\nA **slow-burn balance-sheet recession in China** over the next decade is a serious medium-probability drag on global growth.\n\n### 4.2 Taiwan / South Korea: semiconductor choke points\n\nSemiconductor production is an **AI-critical infrastructure** and heavily concentrated:\n\n- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) alone has **~60\u201370% of the pure-play foundry market**, and Taiwan\u2019s share of global foundry output is above 60%.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3search10\ue202turn3search18\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search14\ue201  \n\nA severe Taiwan Strait crisis\u2014blockade, sanctions, or kinetic conflict\u2014would instantly create:\n\n- a **global chip shortage** affecting AI training/inference, data centres, cloud providers, autos, electronics and industrial machinery,\n- a dual **supply shock** (higher prices, constrained output) and **demand shock** (confidence collapse, trade freeze).\n\nThis is arguably *the single largest discrete tail risk* for the AI-driven global economy.\n\nSouth Korea has similar semiconductor centrality plus a different vulnerability: **very high household debt (~90% of GDP)** prompting regulators to tighten borrowing rules.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue202turn3news42\ue201 An abrupt property downturn could stress local NBFIs; so far, the IMF judges Korean banks as sound but warns about pockets of vulnerability.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search13\ue201\n\n### 4.3 Japan: exit from ultra-easy policy\n\nJapan is exiting two decades of ultra-easy monetary policy:\n\n- The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has ended yield curve control and negative rates, moving policy rates up and tapering government bond purchases.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn3search12\ue201  \n\nThis matters because Japanese investors are huge players in global bond markets. If:\n\n- domestic yields rise faster than expected, or\n- market confidence in Japan\u2019s fiscal trajectory wobbles,\n\nyou could see repatriation of capital, global yield spikes and pressure on risk assets\u2014again feeding into Western financial conditions.\n\n### 4.4 ASEAN and Singapore: transmission hub\n\n- Asia & Pacific are projected to contribute about **60% of global growth**, but are also the region most exposed to trade fragmentation and external demand shocks.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search11\ue202turn4search1\ue201  \n- Singapore is explicitly described by the IMF as a **financial and trade hub with deep interconnectedness** across Asia and the world, serving as a conduit for capital flows, FX, and commodity trade.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search19\ue202turn3search11\ue201  \n\nAny significant Asian shock\u2014China property, Taiwan crisis, regional financial stress\u2014would propagate through Singapore and regional markets via:\n\n- capital outflows,\n- FX volatility,\n- trade finance tightening.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Pulling it together: three 5\u201310-year scenarios\n\nRoughly, you can think in terms of three regimes up to 2030\u20132035.\n\n### A. **Base case: muddling through with moderate AI gains**\n\n**Assumptions**\n\n- No major war or blockade in East Asia; US\u2013China tensions stay at \u201ccold war\u201d levels but stop short of full trade/tech decoupling.  \n- China avoids a sudden financial crisis but remains in a **slow, property-dragged growth regime**.  \n- AI adoption continues but with frictions; macro gains land around the mid-range of estimates (say, **~0.3\u20130.5 percentage points extra productivity** in advanced economies).  \n- Debt overhang is managed with mild financial stresses but no system-wide crisis.\n\n**Outcomes (very roughly)**\n\n- Global growth averages **~3%**, maybe a bit higher if AI and energy capex deliver.  \n- US trend growth ~**2%**; core Europe ~**1.3\u20131.5%**; emerging Asia ~**4\u20135%**.  \n- AI offsets a meaningful slice of demographic drag but does *not* create a second post-war boom.  \n- Inequality rises further unless policy is adjusted, but democratic and market institutions hold.\n\nThis is probably the **modal scenario**.\n\n---\n\n### B. **AI supercycle: Western AI boom, managed Asia risks**\n\n**Assumptions**\n\n- AI diffusion is *faster and deeper* than most central forecasts. Firms re-organise successfully; regulation is supportive but not suffocating; energy and grid investments keep up with AI demand.  \n- China manages a credible restructuring of property and local government debt, shifting growth toward consumption and high-tech manufacturing; no Asia war.  \n- Fragmentation plateaus at \u201cmild to moderate\u201d; re-routing of supply chains continues but without extreme reshoring.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\n- AI boosts labour productivity by **~0.5\u20131 percentage points per year** in AI-intensive Western economies (US, UK, some EU, Canada), closer to the upper bounds of OECD/G7 estimates.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search8\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- By 2035, Western real GDP is **~5\u201310% higher** than baseline; global GDP perhaps **~5\u20137% higher** even after some fragmentation.  \n- Ageing is substantially offset; labour shortages in care, health and education are mitigated by AI-augmented workers.  \n- Equity valuations stay high but are *partly validated* by realised earnings growth.\n\nThis is the **optimistic but plausible** path if policy and execution are good.\n\n---\n\n### C. **Downside: Asia shock + fragmentation + AI disappointment**\n\n**Assumptions**\n\n- China\u2019s property/banking problems deteriorate into a more serious credit event or prolonged deflationary slump.  \n- US\u2013China tensions escalate: broader export controls, retaliatory measures, maybe a **serious Taiwan crisis** short of full war but disruptive enough to damage semiconductor supply.  \n- Geoeconomic fragmentation drifts toward the IMF\u2019s **severe scenario**, cutting several percentage points off global output relative to a cooperative baseline.\ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search7\ue202turn4search11\ue202turn4search8\ue201  \n- AI macro gains come in at the *low* end of estimates due to regulatory frictions, firm inertia and energy bottlenecks, while AI valuations had priced in much more.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\n- Fragmentation + China slump + periodic energy shocks could easily leave global GDP **3\u20137% below** the current IMF baseline by the mid-2030s.\ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search7\ue202turn4search11\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n- Western economies face **low growth + recurrent inflation spikes** (from supply shocks), i.e. a form of rolling stagflation.  \n- Asset valuations correct sharply; fiscal positions worsen as interest costs rise faster than nominal growth.  \n- Politically, this reinforces protectionism and further fragmentation, making a self-reinforcing trap.\n\nAI still exists in this world\u2014it just isn\u2019t enough to overcome macro and geopolitical drag, and may even be scapegoated as part of the problem.\n\n---\n\n## 6. What actually matters to watch, given all this?\n\nFor a 5\u201310-year horizon, the key state variables I\u2019d track are:\n\n1. **AI diffusion indicators** in the West: firm-level adoption rates, capital expenditure on AI + complementary intangibles, and measured productivity in AI-intensive sectors (software, finance, professional services).  \n2. **China\u2019s adjustment path**: property prices, LGFV refinancing, local government finances, and whether Beijing accepts slower growth in exchange for balance-sheet repair.  \n3. **Semiconductor geopolitics**: TSMC/South Korea capacity diversification (US, Europe, Japan) vs concentration in Taiwan; any concrete steps that make a Taiwan shock easier/harder to absorb.  \n4. **Fragmentation vs cooperation**: the trajectory of export controls, tariffs, and technology standards\u2014especially around AI chips and cloud.  \n5. **Debt dynamics under real rates**: whether nominal GDP growth consistently exceeds interest rates in the US/EU/Japan/China, or whether we slide into an interest-rate > growth regime that forces abrupt consolidation or inflation.\n\nIn short: **AI is the main upside driver for Western economies**, but the distribution of outcomes is very wide. Asia is both the growth engine *and* the main source of tail risk, especially via China\u2019s property/debt overhang and Taiwan-centric semiconductor concentration. Over the next decade, whether we end up in a modest AI-boosted muddle-through or something closer to an AI supercycle vs fragmentation-driven stagnation will be decided by how those forces interact.\n\nFor more context on some of these moving pieces, here is recent coverage you might find useful:\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Global economy, AI, and Asia: recent coverage\ue202turn0news40,turn0news41,turn0news42,turn2news38,turn2news39,turn4news20\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search11\ue201","start_idx":1093,"end_idx":1152,"safe_urls":["https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4065170/files/1419247-EN.pdf?ln=fr","https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4065170/files/1419247-EN.pdf?ln=fr&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/reo/apac/issues/2024/10/31/regional-economic-outlook-for-asia-and-pacific-october-2024","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/reo/apac/issues/2024/10/31/regional-economic-outlook-for-asia-and-pacific-october-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/weo","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/weo/issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/weo/issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/weo?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/weo/issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"World Economic Outlook, October 2024: Policy Pivot, ...","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/publications/weo/issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"22 Oct 2024 \u2014 Five years from now, global growth should reach 3.1 percent\u2014a mediocre performance compared with the prepandemic average.

The study highlights that emerging European economies\u2014such as Poland, Bulgaria, and Slovenia\u2014face average annual reductions in GDP per capita growth of nearly 0.4 percentage points between 2024 and 2050 due to shrinking working-age populations and low fertility rates. Advanced economies like South Korea, Italy, Spain, China, Japan, and Germany will also be strongly impacted. With older voters gaining influence, governments are increasingly struggling to implement needed reforms such as raising retirement ages or boosting immigration. The report notes that public opinion heavily favors healthcare and pension spending over education, further complicating long-term strategies. While artificial intelligence might help partially mitigate productivity losses, it cannot fully offset demographic challenges. The EBRD urges immediate action, emphasizing that post-communist countries are ageing before achieving high levels of wealth, and current policy decisions will heavily impact younger generations in the decades to come.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Ageing populations a 'ticking time bomb' for GDP growth, says EBRD","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ageing-populations-ticking-time-bomb-gdp-growth-says-ebrd-2025-11-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has warned that ageing populations pose a serious threat to future GDP growth, particularly in emerging Europe. In its annual report, the EBRD projects that a shrinking working-age population could reduce annual per capita GDP growth by an average of 0.4 percentage points from 2024 to 2050. EBRD Chief Economist Beata Javorcik emphasized that demographic shifts are already reducing living standards and will increasingly hinder economic performance. Many post-communist nations now face the challenge of ageing before achieving high income levels, with inadequate birth rates and limited political support for compensating measures like increased migration or AI-driven productivity. The most viable solution appears to be extending working lives, supported by retraining and pension reform. Additionally, older political leaders and electorates tend to resist necessary reforms. The report also highlights a brief opportunity for younger, growing nations such as Nigeria to benefit from a demographic dividend, which may quickly vanish as birth rates decline.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Financial Times"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search8\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search1\ue201","start_idx":3118,"end_idx":3177,"safe_urls":["https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2024/11/miracle-or-myth-assessing-the-macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence_fde2a597/b524a072-en.pdf","https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2024/11/miracle-or-myth-assessing-the-macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence_fde2a597/b524a072-en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2025/06/macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence-in-g7-economies_dcf91c3e/a5319ab5-en.pdf","https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2025/06/macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence-in-g7-economies_dcf91c3e/a5319ab5-en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence-in-g7-economies_a5319ab5-en.html","https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence-in-g7-economies_a5319ab5-en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/miracle-or-myth-assessing-the-macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence_b524a072-en.html","https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/miracle-or-myth-assessing-the-macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence_b524a072-en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence-in-g7-economies_a5319ab5-en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Macroeconomic productivity gains from Artificial ...","url":"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence-in-g7-economies_a5319ab5-en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by F Filippucci \u00b7 2025 \u00b7 Cited by 4 \u2014 The paper studies the expected macroeconomic productivity gains from Artificial Intelligence (AI) over a 10-year horizon in G7 economies.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Macroeconomic productivity gains from Artificial ...","url":"https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2025/06/macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence-in-g7-economies_dcf91c3e/a5319ab5-en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by F Filippucci \u00b7 2025 \u00b7 Cited by 4 \u2014 AI is expected to cause 0.4-1.3% annual productivity growth in high AI exposure G7 countries, and 0.2-0.8% in less favorable countries.","attribution":"OECD"},{"title":"Miracle or Myth?

She emphasized that Europe has missed the opportunity to be a first mover and could face long-term consequences similar to those from its slow adoption of previous digital technologies.\n\nLagarde stressed that simply purchasing AI technology from foreign providers will increase dependency and vulnerability, and called for diversification in essential AI infrastructure such as compute capacity, chips, and data centers. To foster growth, she urged the EU to enforce open standards, improve energy affordability, streamline regulation across member states, and create an integrated capital market to finance innovation.

According to OECD econometric modeling, localizing supply chains through higher tariffs, domestic subsidies, and sourcing restrictions could reduce global trade by 18% and GDP by up to 12% in affected countries. Marion Jansen, OECD's trade and agriculture head, warned against overcorrecting from dependency on single trade partners to complete autarky, which could expose economies to internal shocks and inefficiencies. The study found that since the mid-1990s, dependency on China has risen significantly among OECD countries, particularly in advanced manufacturing sectors. China now serves as the dominant trading partner in 30% of highly concentrated import cases for these countries, up from 5% in the late 1990s. While some large non-OECD economies have one-sided dependencies on China, OECD member nations often have mutual dependencies. Importantly, the report concluded that reshoring does not enhance resilience, with over half the economies modeled becoming more vulnerable to economic volatility. Instead, the OECD recommends embracing openness and geographical trade diversification to better manage disruptions.","attribution":"Financial Times"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"IMF"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn3search11\ue201","start_idx":6579,"end_idx":6611,"safe_urls":["https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4065170/files/1419247-EN.pdf?ln=fr","https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4065170/files/1419247-EN.pdf?ln=fr&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ageing-populations-ticking-time-bomb-gdp-growth-says-ebrd-2025-11-25/","https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ageing-populations-ticking-time-bomb-gdp-growth-says-ebrd-2025-11-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ageing-populations-ticking-time-bomb-gdp-growth-says-ebrd-2025-11-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Ageing populations a 'ticking time bomb' for GDP growth, says EBRD","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ageing-populations-ticking-time-bomb-gdp-growth-says-ebrd-2025-11-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1764064732.0,"snippet":"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has warned that ageing populations pose a serious threat to future GDP growth, particularly in emerging Europe. In its annual report, the EBRD projects that a shrinking working-age population could reduce annual per capita GDP growth by an average of 0.4 percentage points from 2024 to 2050. EBRD Chief Economist Beata Javorcik emphasized that demographic shifts are already reducing living standards and will increasingly hinder economic performance. Many post-communist nations now face the challenge of ageing before achieving high income levels, with inadequate birth rates and limited political support for compensating measures like increased migration or AI-driven productivity. The most viable solution appears to be extending working lives, supported by retraining and pension reform. Additionally, older political leaders and electorates tend to resist necessary reforms. The report also highlights a brief opportunity for younger, growing nations such as Nigeria to benefit from a demographic dividend, which may quickly vanish as birth rates decline.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"resilient growth but higher risks. | Regional economic outlook","url":"https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4065170/files/1419247-EN.pdf?ln=fr&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"21 Nov 2024 \u2014 The Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific is published once a year, in the fall, to review developments in Asia and the Pacific.

The high valuations are being driven by investor \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO) and excessive optimism about the global implementation and success of artificial intelligence (AI). The ECB noted that current market pricing fails to reflect ongoing vulnerabilities and uncertainties amid a renewed risk-on sentiment post an April sell-off.\n\nWhile the ECB does not claim a bubble is forming, it cautions that a correction could occur if the optimistic AI scenario doesn't materialize. Unlike the dotcom boom of 2000, today\u2019s tech firms generally have strong business fundamentals, yet risks persist due to opaque private markets and potential liquidity pressures in European financial institutions. Additional concerns include US political interference with central bank independence, soaring US debt, and possible turmoil in the US Treasuries market\u2014risks that could impact global financial stability. The ECB also highlighted fiscal instability in some Eurozone countries, particularly France, as a threat to investor confidence and bond market stability.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Annual Report 2024/25","url":"https://www.bis.org/about/areport/areport2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"29 Jun 2025 \u2014 As interest rates remain higher for longer, financial stability risks emerged prominently from high leverage and low liquidity of non-bank.","attribution":"Bank for International Settlements"},{"title":"Financial Stability in A Higher-for-Longer Interest Rate ...","url":"https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2024/English/wpiea2024080-print-pdf.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by A Alter \u00b7 2024 \u2014 After years of low interest rates, higher interest rates amid tighter monetary policy are challenging banks' effective risk management in securities ...","attribution":"IMF"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Financial Times"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn2search15\ue202turn2search9\ue201","start_idx":8242,"end_idx":8288,"safe_urls":["https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/miracle-or-myth-assessing-macroeconomic-productivity-gains-artificial-intelligence","https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/miracle-or-myth-assessing-macroeconomic-productivity-gains-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://ideas.repec.org/p/cbo/report/60774.html","https://ideas.repec.org/p/cbo/report/60774.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-productivity-distribution-and-growth_8d900037-en.html","https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-productivity-distribution-and-growth_8d900037-en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-productivity-distribution-and-growth_8d900037-en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The impact of Artificial Intelligence on productivity, ...","url":"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-productivity-distribution-and-growth_8d900037-en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"It examines AI's unique capacity for autonomy and self-improvement, which could accelerate innovation and potentially revive sluggish productivity growth ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential Effects on the Eco","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/p/cbo/report/60774.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"In this report, CBO provides an overview of the channels through which the adoption of AI could affect the U.S. economy and the federal budget.","attribution":"IDEAS/RePEc"},{"title":"Miracle or myth: Assessing the macroeconomic productivity ...","url":"https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/miracle-or-myth-assessing-macroeconomic-productivity-gains-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"8 Dec 2024 \u2014 Filippucci, F, P Gal and M Schief (2024), \"Miracle or Myth?

The report also highlights a brief opportunity for younger, growing nations such as Nigeria to benefit from a demographic dividend, which may quickly vanish as birth rates decline.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Financial Times"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search1\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search7\ue202turn4search11\ue202turn4search8\ue202turn4search9\ue201","start_idx":11106,"end_idx":11204,"safe_urls":["https://amro-asia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DP_No23_Geoeconomic_fragmentation_2024.pdf","https://amro-asia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DP_No23_Geoeconomic_fragmentation_2024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/SDN/2023/English/SDNEA2023001.ashx","https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/SDN/2023/English/SDNEA2023001.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2023/01/16/confronting-fragmentation-where-it-matters-most-trade-debt-and-climate-action","https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2023/01/16/confronting-fragmentation-where-it-matters-most-trade-debt-and-climate-action?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation","https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/the-costs-of-geoeconomic-fragmentation-bolhuis-chen-kett","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/the-costs-of-geoeconomic-fragmentation-bolhuis-chen-kett?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/geoeconomic-fragmentation-to-cut-off-upto-7-of-global-gdp%3A-imf-staff","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/geoeconomic-fragmentation-to-cut-off-upto-7-of-global-gdp%3A-imf-staff?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/global-gdp-may-lose-7-if-fragmentation-deepens-imf-first-deputy-managing-director-says","https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/global-gdp-may-lose-7-if-fragmentation-deepens-imf-first-deputy-managing-director-says?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/the-costs-of-geoeconomic-fragmentation-bolhuis-chen-kett?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Costs of Geoeconomic Fragmentation-Bolhuis-Chen-Kett","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/the-costs-of-geoeconomic-fragmentation-bolhuis-chen-kett?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Such a strategic decoupling would lead to permanent GDP losses of 0.3 percent globally, roughly equivalent to the annual output of Norway (Chart 2).This global ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Geoeconomic Fragmentation and the Future of ...","url":"https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/SDN/2023/English/SDNEA2023001.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by TG Garcia-Saltos \u00b7 2023 \u00b7 Cited by 3 \u2014 The baseline results suggest sizeable output losses of about 1.2 percent of world GDP; when escalating non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in other ...","attribution":"IMF"},{"title":"The High Cost of Global Economic Fragmentation","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"28 Aug 2023 \u2014 While estimates of the cost of fragmentation vary, greater international trade restrictions could reduce global economic output by as much as 7 ...","attribution":"IMF"},{"title":"Confronting Fragmentation Where It Matters Most: Trade, ...","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2023/01/16/confronting-fragmentation-where-it-matters-most-trade-debt-and-climate-action?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"15 Jan 2023 \u2014 If technological decoupling is added to the mix, some countries could see losses of up to 12 percent of GDP.

The downgrade follows a sharp drop in Vanke\u2019s bond and stock prices after reports of potential debt restructuring. Vanke, partially owned by the state-backed Shenzhen Metro, is now seeking to delay repayment of a 2 billion yuan onshore bond due in December, a move that raises concerns about its ability to meet a looming \u201cbond maturity wall\u201d of 11.4 billion yuan by May 2026. S&P also placed Vanke on CreditWatch with negative implications, projecting negative operating cash flow.\n\nThe downgrade comes amidst ongoing turmoil in China\u2019s real estate sector, which has faced a liquidity crisis since 2021. Though the government has emphasized completion of pre-sold homes, support for developers like Vanke remains uncertain. Vanke\u2019s total interest-bearing liabilities stand at 364.3 billion yuan, and it reported a Q3 net loss of 16.1 billion yuan. Market reactions included bond trading suspensions and stocks hitting record lows, reflecting widespread investor anxiety.

This sharp decline has revived investor fears about the lack of strong central government support for the struggling real estate sector amid persistent deflationary pressures post-COVID. In October, new home prices in China fell at their fastest rate in a year, signaling continued weak housing demand. Vanke\u2019s bond due in March 2027 dropped nearly 30% by midday, a steep reversal from earlier this year when bond values rebounded on hopes of government intervention. Market analyst Yao Yu noted that while Shenzhen may be seeking Beijing's help, it's unclear whether further support will come. Although Vanke recently announced a potential 22 billion yuan ($3.09 billion) loan from Shenzhen Metro, the broader policy environment remains cautious, with no new large-scale stimulus introduced in 2025.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced the move in anticipation of potential further easing of monetary policy by the central bank. The \"stress debt-to-service ratios\" rule, which accounts for the risk of borrowing cost fluctuations, will be reinforced. This rule was initially introduced in February 2024 and further tightened in September, amid concerns over the high household debt levels in the economy. The FSC aims to limit household debt growth to 3.8% for the year, aligning it with nominal economic growth, to maintain the household debt to GDP ratio at around 90.5%. The Bank of Korea has indicated plans for additional interest rate cuts, having already reduced the benchmark rate to 2.75%.

populations a 'ticking time bomb' for GDP growth, says EBRD","snippet":"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has warned that ageing populations pose a serious threat to future GDP growth, particularly in emerging Europe. In its annual report, the EBRD projects that a shrinking working-age population could reduce annual per capita GDP growth by an average of 0.4 percentage points from 2024 to 2050. EBRD Chief Economist Beata Javorcik emphasized that demographic shifts are already reducing living standards and will increasingly hinder economic performance. Many post-communist nations now face the challenge of ageing before achieving high income levels, with inadequate birth rates and limited political support for compensating measures like increased migration or AI-driven productivity. The most viable solution appears to be extending working lives, supported by retraining and pension reform. Additionally, older political leaders and electorates tend to resist necessary reforms. The report also highlights a brief opportunity for younger, growing nations such as Nigeria to benefit from a demographic dividend, which may quickly vanish as birth rates decline.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1764064732.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/3a675f7f-ff46-4b8d-9744-08dfed18d23a","title":"Ageing populations will lead to lower living standards, warns study","snippet":"A report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) warns that ageing populations in Europe and other regions will lead to declining living standards and lower GDP per capita growth. The study highlights that emerging European economies\u2014such as Poland, Bulgaria, and Slovenia\u2014face average annual reductions in GDP per capita growth of nearly 0.4 percentage points between 2024 and 2050 due to shrinking working-age populations and low fertility rates. Advanced economies like South Korea, Italy, Spain, China, Japan, and Germany will also be strongly impacted. With older voters gaining influence, governments are increasingly struggling to implement needed reforms such as raising retirement ages or boosting immigration. The report notes that public opinion heavily favors healthcare and pension spending over education, further complicating long-term strategies. While artificial intelligence might help partially mitigate productivity losses, it cannot fully offset demographic challenges. The EBRD urges immediate action, emphasizing that post-communist countries are ageing before achieving high levels of wealth, and current policy decisions will heavily impact younger generations in the decades to come.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51},"pub_date":1764050410.613,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/b5157c3c-568e-4a49-ba19-e8bda1fc7bec","title":"The fracturing of the world economy","snippet":"In his new book \"The Fractured Age,\" Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, argues that the world economy is undergoing a fracturing rather than full deglobalization. While global trade may not decline drastically, there will be a reorientation toward ideologically aligned trading blocs. The world is likely to split into a US-centered and a China-centered bloc, with unaligned nations caught in between. Shearing contends that the U.S. will benefit more, given the economic strength and technological capabilities of its allies. At market prices, the U.S. bloc controls 68% of global GDP, compared to 26% for the China bloc.\n\nShearing also suggests that China is more vulnerable in this fractured scenario due to its reliance on trade surpluses and stagnating economic growth, potentially slowing to 2%. However, the article critiques Shearing for underestimating China\u2019s resilience and overestimating the cohesion of the US bloc, especially in light of unreliable US foreign policy and internal challenges. The piece emphasizes that although the global economy is fragmenting, the broader outcome may be detrimental for all, eroding post-WWII stability and making global cooperation\u2014such as on climate change\u2014more difficult.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52},"pub_date":1764089015.505,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/70fc473d-79b4-4e75-bd8f-9fa721690d02","title":"Trade wars to weigh on two-thirds of developing countries, World Bank warns","snippet":"The World Bank warns that the ongoing global trade war, led by the U.S., will hinder economic growth in nearly two-thirds of developing countries in 2025. Projected growth for these economies is 3.8%, down from 4.2% in 2024, with per capita income growth falling to 2.9%. Overall global growth will be the slowest since 2008 outside of recession years. The slowdown reverses the benefits of globalization, which had significantly reduced extreme poverty and boosted GDP in developing nations in past decades. Foreign direct investment into these regions has halved since its 2008 peak, and further risks include rising trade barriers, geopolitical tensions, and policy uncertainty. The World Bank emphasizes that while high-income countries have regained their pre-pandemic economic trajectory, developing nations, excluding China, may take two decades to recover. Despite the gloomy outlook, emerging markets' financial assets have surged in 2025, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar and possible tariff rollbacks. Many of these countries now have stronger economic fundamentals, aided by improved fiscal management and inflation control over the past decade. Nonetheless, sustained global cooperation is needed to restore a stable trade environment and support struggling nations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":53},"pub_date":1749562223.695,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"data.worldbank.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG","title":"GDP growth (annual %)","snippet":"GDP growth (annual %) Country official statistics, National Statistical Organizations and/or Central Banks; National Accounts data files, Organisation for ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"data.worldbank.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS","title":"Trade (% of GDP)","snippet":"Trade (% of GDP) Country official statistics, National Statistical Organizations and/or Central Banks; National Accounts data files, Organisation for Economic ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"data.worldbank.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=1W","title":"GDP growth (annual %) - World","snippet":"GDP growth (annual %) - World.

This would represent the slowest growth in a non-recession year since 2008. The updated outlook reflects increased economic uncertainty stemming from ongoing trade tensions and elevated policy unpredictability, notably sparked by a recent tariff announcement by President Trump and the subsequent global trade disputes. The bank emphasized that such tensions disrupt established international policy frameworks that had long supported poverty reduction and economic growth. The World Bank also lowered its 2025 GDP growth estimates for the U.S. (to 1.4% from 2.3%), the Euro area, and Japan, while maintaining China's forecast. While positive outcomes from ongoing trade negotiations, such as those between the U.S. and China, could improve the outlook, unresolved disputes or escalating trade restrictions could further hinder global economic progress and potentially trigger financial stress.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":54},"pub_date":1749586169.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_692bf5593498832b8e995cb72ba36d1e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing macroeconomic trends and drivers (1980-2025)","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6e59bbd3-05a2-4174-919c-49f0559d0e27","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c242fcac-0635-428d-ae4a-c11bcf1c0a01","turn_exchange_id":"570989c4-8f5a-4688-be0e-4c3c61035061"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c242fcac-0635-428d-ae4a-c11bcf1c0a01","children":["1d45a92b-94fa-48e2-b7d7-605a5d917c37"]},"1d45a92b-94fa-48e2-b7d7-605a5d917c37":{"id":"1d45a92b-94fa-48e2-b7d7-605a5d917c37","message":{"id":"1d45a92b-94fa-48e2-b7d7-605a5d917c37","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764488548.427617,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Historical context for the 1980-2025 boom","content":"I\u2019m recalling key periods from 1980-2025 and their impact:\n1. **Globalization:** The trade-to-GDP ratio doubled, and China, Eastern Europe, and others integrated into global value chains.  \n2. **Demographics:** Big growth in the working-age population, especially from the 80s-2000s, which brought a demographic dividend.  \n3. **Disinflation & falling rates:** Volcker-driven disinflation, high initial real rates, and lower inflation led to falling interest rates and a global savings glut.","chunks":["I\u2019m recalling key periods from 1980-2025 and their impact:","1. **Globalization:** The trade-to-GDP ratio doubled, and China, Eastern Europe, and others integrated into global value chains.","2. **Demographics:** Big growth in the working-age population, especially from the 80s-2000s, which brought a demographic dividend.","3. **Disinflation & falling rates:** Volcker-driven disinflation, high initial real rates, and lower inflation led to falling interest rates and a global savings glut."],"finished":true},{"summary":"Key factors driving the 1980-2025 boom","content":"1.

This wealth, now over 5.4 times world GDP, is increasingly disconnected from real economic fundamentals, with much of the growth stemming from paper gains and cumulative inflation. Only 30% of the increase has come from real investment, while rising asset values have also fueled a surge in global debt to 2.6 times GDP. McKinsey warns this imbalance makes the global economy vulnerable, with future financial stability hinging on whether productivity\u2014potentially through AI innovations\u2014can close the gap, or if prolonged inflation will erode wealth.

This marks the slowest growth outside of recessions since 2008 and positions the 2020s to be the weakest economic decade since the 1960s. The twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report highlights that investment, trade, and development progress, especially in developing nations outside Asia, have significantly slowed. Chief Economist Indermit Gill noted the sharp decline in economic growth in developing economies\u2014from 6% in the 2000s to under 4% in the 2020s. The report warns that key drivers of past global economic rise, such as increased productivity and expanded trade, are now reversing. Governments are urged to resolve trade disputes, reform fiscal policies, and attract investment. Risks such as escalating tariffs and policy uncertainty could further hinder growth. Additionally, over half of low-income nations face debt distress, worsened by reduced aid from developed countries.

Projected growth for these economies is 3.8%, down from 4.2% in 2024, with per capita income growth falling to 2.9%. Overall global growth will be the slowest since 2008 outside of recession years. The slowdown reverses the benefits of globalization, which had significantly reduced extreme poverty and boosted GDP in developing nations in past decades. Foreign direct investment into these regions has halved since its 2008 peak, and further risks include rising trade barriers, geopolitical tensions, and policy uncertainty. The World Bank emphasizes that while high-income countries have regained their pre-pandemic economic trajectory, developing nations, excluding China, may take two decades to recover. Despite the gloomy outlook, emerging markets' financial assets have surged in 2025, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar and possible tariff rollbacks. Many of these countries now have stronger economic fundamentals, aided by improved fiscal management and inflation control over the past decade.

Since 2006, women's share of hours worked in mining increased from 13% to 18%, and in construction from 8% to 11%. Overall, women\u2019s workforce participation has risen from 45.1% to 47.9%, but they still account for a smaller share of total hours worked (42.9%) due to a higher tendency to work part-time.\n\nThe gender gap in hours worked is closing faster than the headcount-based measure and could reach parity by the late 2040s. Notable growth has occurred among women over 55, with participation rising from 48% to 64% over two decades. AI Group credits this improvement to workplace cultural changes, increased STEM education uptake, technological advancements making jobs more accessible, expanded childcare, and parental leave policies. Female-dominated fields like healthcare and education see women contributing over 70% of work hours, while gender-balanced sectors show a 45-55% female share. The findings underscore the importance of targeted initiatives to further close the gender participation gap.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1758154140.0,"attribution":"www.news.com.au"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_692bf5593498832b8e995cb72ba36d1e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Documenting the 1980-2025 economic boom drivers","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6e59bbd3-05a2-4174-919c-49f0559d0e27","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"fa055b18-8e15-416c-b460-51a1ce15f9a2","turn_exchange_id":"570989c4-8f5a-4688-be0e-4c3c61035061"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fa055b18-8e15-416c-b460-51a1ce15f9a2","children":["f6e06310-bb8c-48f0-b11a-91ba58411439"]},"f6e06310-bb8c-48f0-b11a-91ba58411439":{"id":"f6e06310-bb8c-48f0-b11a-91ba58411439","message":{"id":"f6e06310-bb8c-48f0-b11a-91ba58411439","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764488571.028989,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Framing and structuring the global economic boom","content":"I\u2019m going to frame 1980-2025 as a \"long supercycle\" for global GDP, trade, and wealth.

What the 1980-2025 boom looked like\n\nSome headline facts:\n\n- **Global output exploded.** Global real gross domestic product (GDP) roughly quadrupled in volume since the early 1980s, while global population \u201conly\u201d doubled.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n- **Trade integration surged.** World trade (exports + imports) rose from ~**40\u201345% of global GDP in 1980** to above **60%** by the late 2000s, before flattening and dipping slightly after 2008.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn1search21\ue201  \n- **The working-age population boomed.** The world\u2019s working-age population grew from ~2.1 billion in 1970 to ~5.1 billion in 2020, with an **average growth rate ~1.75% per year** and a peak of **2.3% in the 1980s**\u2014historically unprecedented.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- **Real interest rates fell for decades.** From the early 1980s to the 2010s, global real interest rates dropped by roughly **3\u20134 percentage points**, to historically low peacetime levels.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search22\ue201  \n- **Emerging markets, especially Asia, rose.** Asia\u2019s share of global GDP rose sharply; emerging markets\u2019 share of world GDP climbed from ~20% in 1980 to well over a third by the 2010s, with Asia ex-Japan projected to account for ~two-fifths of global GDP by 2030 in some scenarios.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue202turn1search22\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n\nNet effect: **a world of rapid globalisation, expanding labour supply, cheap capital and huge gains from technology and institutional reform.**\n\nNow let\u2019s unpack the main structural drivers and what\u2019s happening to each.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The major drivers of 1980-2025\n\n### Driver 1 \u2013 Demographic dividend and labour-force expansion\n\n**What it did (1980-2025)**\n\n- Global working-age population grew extremely fast, especially in the 1980s\u20132000s.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- Massive **rural-to-urban migration** in China, other Asian economies, and later parts of Africa and Latin America moved workers from low-productivity agriculture into higher-productivity industry and services.  \n- **Female labour force participation** in advanced economies rose significantly from the 1970s through the 1990s, thanks to education, services growth, childcare, and legal changes.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search21\ue201  \n\nThis gave you:\n\n- More workers per retiree (favourable dependency ratios)  \n- Faster growth in effective labour input than in population  \n- A huge \u201cfree\u201d boost to GDP growth even without dramatic productivity miracles\n\n**Status now**\n\n- **Advanced economies and China:** demographic dividend is over; ageing is now a *drag*. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) estimates ageing will cut annual per-capita GDP growth by ~0.4 percentage points in emerging Europe; similar headwinds apply to Germany, Japan, South Korea, Italy, Spain and China.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news50\ue202turn0news51\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n- **Least developed and younger countries:** still positive dividends in parts of South Asia, ASEAN and Africa, where working-age populations will keep rising for decades.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Verdict:**  \n- In rich countries and China, demographic dividend has **flipped to a structural headwind**.  \n- In younger emerging markets it remains a **tailwind**, but requires education, governance and capital to convert into real growth.\n\n---\n\n### Driver 2 \u2013 Globalisation and trade liberalisation\n\n**What it did (1980-2025)**\n\n- **Tariff cuts and trade agreements** (Uruguay Round, formation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), European Union single market) opened markets.  \n- **China\u2019s reform and opening** from 1978, culminating in **WTO accession in 2001**, plugged hundreds of millions of workers into global supply chains. China\u2019s trade in goods jumped from about **$516 billion in 2001** to **$4.1 trillion in 2017**, making it the world\u2019s top exporter.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search24\ue201  \n- World trade as a share of GDP rose dramatically up to 2008.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn1search17\ue201  \n\nMechanisms:\n\n- Exploited **comparative advantage** at global scale.  \n- **Offshoring and global value chains** cut production costs and consumer prices, especially for manufactured goods.  \n- Integrated **Eastern Europe, China, ASEAN, Mexico, etc.** into the world system, boosting productivity via technology transfer and scale.\n\n**Status now**\n\n- Trade openness peaked around the **2008 global financial crisis**; since then, trade-to-GDP ratios have flattened or fallen slightly, with some compositional changes (e.g. mining and fuels).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search21\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n- Since ~2016: **tariffs, trade wars and industrial policy** (US\u2013China tariff escalation, tech export controls, sanctions) have visibly reversed parts of globalisation. The World Bank and others now describe **trade and investment as key drivers of the 1980-2008 boom that are currently weakening or reversing**, contributing to the 2020s being on track as the weakest decade for global growth since the 1960s.\ue200cite\ue202turn1news41\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn1search20\ue201  \n- We seem to be moving from hyper-globalisation to **\u201cbloc-based\u201d trade**: friend-shoring, near-shoring, and duplication of supply chains.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news52\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Verdict:**  \n- The gigantic \u201cone-off\u201d efficiency gain from globalisation is **mostly spent**.  \n- We are in a **partial reversal / fragmentation phase**: some local winners (Mexico, Vietnam, India) but **net global headwind** vs the 1980-2008 era.\n\n---\n\n### Driver 3 \u2013 Disinflation and the multi-decade collapse in interest rates\n\n**What it did (1980-2025)**\n\n- Early 1980s: *very* high inflation and nominal interest rates in advanced economies (e.g. US Federal Funds rate >15%).  \n- Paul Volcker\u2019s disinflation in the United States, similar moves elsewhere, plus institutional changes (independent central banks, inflation targeting) broke the back of inflation by the early 1990s.  \n- From then on, **real interest rates fell for three decades**, driven by monetary policy, demographics, a global \u201csavings glut\u201d, and low investment demand.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0search27\ue201  \n\nThis had enormous effects:\n\n- **Cost of capital collapsed**, enabling more investment and risk-taking.  \n- **Asset valuations (bonds, equities, real estate) rose**, as lower discount rates pushed up present values.  \n- Debt burdens looked manageable as nominal GDP growth exceeded funding costs for extended periods.\n\n**Status now**\n\n- The **2021-2023 inflation shock** (pandemic + war + energy + supply chains) forced the most aggressive global rate-hiking cycle in decades.  \n- Even after some easing, policy makers (e.g. International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements) now talk about a **regime of higher real rates and higher term premia** compared with the 2010s.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- Global public and private debt is at or near record levels; higher rates on a much larger debt stock are now a **drag** on fiscal space, investment and risk appetite.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1news40\ue201  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Verdict:**  \n- The *falling*-rates super-tailwind (1980-2020) is **over**.  \n- At best rates stabilise; more likely, **debt + higher real rates is a structural headwind**, plus a source of financial-stability risk.\n\n---\n\n### Driver 4 \u2013 Financial liberalisation and leverage\n\n**What it did (1980-2025)**\n\n- Deregulation: \u201cBig Bang\u201d in London, repeal of Glass\u2013Steagall in the US, liberalisation of capital accounts across emerging markets.  \n- Explosion of **credit, securitisation and derivatives**; growth of shadow banking and non-bank financial institutions.  \n- Households and firms borrowed more; governments deepened bond markets.\n\nShort-run benefits:\n\n- Easier access to credit for consumption and investment.  \n- Stronger demand and higher measured GDP.  \n- Large global capital flows into emerging markets.\n\nBut also:\n\n- A chain of **leverage-driven crises**: Latin America 1980s, Japan 1990, Asian crisis 1997, dot-com bust 2000, global financial crisis (GFC) 2008, Eurozone sovereign crisis, and various emerging-market currency episodes.\n\n**Status now**\n\n- Balance sheets across sectors are **heavily levered**.  \n- Regulatory push since the GFC (Basel III/IV, macro-prudential policy) plus higher rates constrain further leverage growth.  \n- The \u201ceasy credit expansion\u201d phase is largely done; focus is shifting to **managing and terming out existing debt**.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Verdict:**  \n- Financialisation was a **mixed tailwind** (growth + fragility) that is now more **headwind than help**: high leverage, periodic crises, tighter regulation, less space for credit-fuelled booms.\n\n---\n\n### Driver 5 \u2013 Information and communication technology (ICT) revolution\n\n**What it did (1980-2025)**\n\n- Microprocessors, personal computers, the internet, mobile telephony, enterprise software, cloud computing.  \n- In the US, labour productivity growth accelerated sharply from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, driven largely by **ICT-intensive sectors (IT hardware, software, finance, retail, logistics)**.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search19\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n- ICT enabled **global value chains**, real-time logistics, and the entire platform economy (e-commerce, online advertising, cloud).  \n- This was arguably the **core \u201ctrue\u201d productivity engine** of the period, especially in the US.\n\nAfter ~2005, there was a well-documented **productivity slowdown**, even as digital tech continued to advance, suggesting diminishing marginal gains from \u201cclassic\u201d ICT deployment.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n\n**Status now**\n\n- Baseline digitalisation is mature in advanced economies: almost every large firm already uses ICT heavily.  \n- New potential wave: **artificial intelligence (AI) and automation**\u2014particularly generative models\u2014could act as *second-round* productivity drivers atop the existing digital stack (this is what we discussed in your previous question).  \n- However, the scale and timing of AI-driven productivity gains are still uncertain and path-dependent.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Verdict:**  \n- The **first wave** (PCs, internet, mobiles, basic automation) is **largely saturated**\u2014you still get gains, but at lower incremental returns.  \n- The **second wave (AI)** is **nascent**: could become a major tailwind in the 2030s, or disappoint if diffusion and reorganisation are slow.\n\n---\n\n### Driver 6 \u2013 The geopolitical and institutional order (\u201cPax Americana\u201d and the WTO era)\n\n**What it did (1980-2025)**\n\n- End of the Cold War; collapse of the Soviet Union; gradual integration of Eastern Europe into the European Union.  \n- US military and economic dominance underpinned a relatively predictable **rules-based global order**:  \n  - Freedom of navigation,  \n  - Expansion of multilateral institutions (WTO, International Monetary Fund reforms, World Bank lending, regional development banks),  \n  - Security guarantees allowing countries to spend relatively less on defence and more on development.  \n- This environment **lowered geopolitical risk premia** and encouraged cross-border investment and trade.\n\n**Status now**\n\n- Clear shift toward **fracturing / bloc formation**: US\u2013China rivalry, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, sanctions and countersanctions, regional tensions in the Middle East and East Asia.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news52\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1news41\ue201  \n- Trade wars and controls (chips, advanced manufacturing, green tech) are being used as **strategic weapons**, not just economic tools.\ue200cite\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn0search21\ue201  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Verdict:**  \n- \u201cPax Americana + hyper-globalisation\u201d was a *huge hidden tailwind*; that phase is **over**.  \n- We\u2019re moving into a **messier, multi-polar, more securitised regime**, which is structurally a headwind for efficiency (even if it creates new capex in defence and \u201cresilience\u201d).\n\n---\n\n### Driver 7 \u2013 Energy, resources and environmental externalities\n\n**What it did (1980-2025)**\n\n- After the oil shocks of the 1970s, the 1980s and 1990s experienced **falling or stable real oil and commodity prices**, except for spikes (e.g. Gulf War).  \n- The 2000s saw a commodity \u201csuper-cycle\u201d driven by Chinese industrialisation, but the **shale revolution** in the 2010s brought abundant US oil and gas supply again.  \n- For most of 1980-2015, climate constraints were **politically distant** relative to growth, so externalities from fossil fuel use weren\u2019t priced fully.\n\nThis amounted to:\n\n- Abundant, relatively cheap energy  \n- Minimal carbon pricing  \n- Limited restrictions on resource-heavy growth models\n\n**Status now**\n\n- Climate science + visible climate impacts + policy have converged into a **binding constraint**:  \n  - Growing carbon-pricing schemes, emissions regulations, and climate-related disclosure rules;  \n  - Rising pressure to decarbonise power, transport, and industry.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search17\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- The **energy transition** requires massive investment (a demand tailwind) but also risks **periodic supply squeezes and higher prices** if fossil fuel supply shrinks faster than clean capacity ramps up.  \n- Climate damages (extreme weather, droughts, floods, fires) are beginning to show up in insurance costs and productivity.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Verdict:**  \n- Cheap, unregulated fossil energy was a tailwind that is now **gradually reversing**.  \n- The transition is *both* a tailwind (investment, innovation) and a headwind (higher costs, stranded assets, volatility).\n\n---\n\n### Driver 8 \u2013 The rise of China and emerging markets\n\n**What it did (1980-2025)**\n\n- China\u2019s reform and opening turned a low-income, largely agrarian economy into an upper-middle-income manufacturing powerhouse in ~40 years, lifting hundreds of millions from poverty and becoming the largest single contributor to global growth.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- Other emerging markets (India, ASEAN, parts of Latin America and Africa) also integrated more deeply, increasing their share of global GDP and accounting for the bulk of global growth in the 2000s\u20132010s.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue202turn1search22\ue202turn1search9\ue201  \n\nThis:\n\n- Provided **cheap labour and manufactured goods** for the world.  \n- Created enormous new **demand for commodities, capital goods and services**.  \n- Drove a historic fall in **extreme poverty** globally.\n\n**Status now**\n\n- China faces a trifecta of **ageing, high debt and a property overhang**, and its growth has slowed sharply, with many analysts expecting low-single-digit growth ahead.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- Other emerging markets still have room to catch up, but are now growing in a world of **trade tensions, higher global rates and weaker external demand**.\ue200cite\ue202turn1news41\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn1search20\ue201  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Verdict:**  \n- The one-time surge from China\u2019s entry and early convergence is **mostly behind us**.  \n- EMs remain a **relative tailwind**, but under much tougher global conditions.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What is waning, reversing, or still a tailwind?\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n**Clearly waning or reversing (now net headwinds vs 1980-2008)**\n\n1. **Demographics** in advanced economies + China  \n2. **Hyper-globalisation** and frictionless trade  \n3. **Multi-decade decline in real interest rates**  \n4. **Credit/financialisation as an easy growth lever**  \n5. **Unipolar, rules-based geopolitical order**  \n6. **Cheap, lightly regulated fossil-fuel regime**  \n7. **China\u2019s high-speed convergence phase**\n\n**Still tailwinds, but more incremental**\n\n1. **Baseline ICT and digitalisation** \u2013 still helping, but the low-hanging fruit is gone.  \n2. **Female labour-force participation** \u2013 still rising in some countries, especially older women and in some emerging markets, but late-cycle in rich economies.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1news43\ue201  \n\n**Potential *new* or renewed tailwinds for the next era**\n\n1. **AI and advanced automation** \u2013 possible new productivity shock sitting on top of mature ICT.  \n2. **Energy transition, grid and infrastructure investment** \u2013 huge capex cycle if managed well.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search17\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n3. **Younger emerging markets (India, frontier Asia, Africa)** \u2013 sizeable remaining demographic dividends, conditional on policy and capital.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn1search15\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### Where that leaves the \u201c1980-2025 boom\u201d\n\nThe long boom was not the result of one magic factor; it was the **intersection** of:\n\n- historically fast labour-force growth,  \n- unprecedented trade and capital integration,  \n- falling inflation and interest rates,  \n- a cluster of positive technology shocks (ICT + logistics), and  \n- a relatively benign geopolitical environment.\n\nFrom about 2010 onward\u2014and decisively in the 2020s\u2014**most of these legacy tailwinds have either plateaued or flipped sign.** That\u2019s why institutions like the World Bank now expect the 2020s to be the **weakest decade for global growth since the 1960s**, explicitly pointing to **slowing productivity and trade** as former drivers that are now fading.\ue200cite\ue202turn1news41\ue202turn1search20\ue201  \n\nSo the macro story going forward is:\n\n> We are exiting a world where growth rode on demographics + globalisation + falling rates, and entering one where growth\u2014if it\u2019s to be robust\u2014has to ride on **technology (AI), successful energy transition, institutional resilience and smart management of ageing and debt**, in a fractured geopolitical landscape.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can next:\n\n- formalise this into a **\u201cgrowth accounting\u201d style decomposition** (labour, capital, total factor productivity) for 1980-2025 and then  \n- sketch what 2025-2040 looks like under different assumptions for each component."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search15\ue201","start_idx":621,"end_idx":654,"safe_urls":["https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run","https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/10/global-gdp-asia-economy/","https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/10/global-gdp-asia-economy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/10/global-gdp-asia-economy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Here's how global GDP has changed over the past 40 years","url":"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/10/global-gdp-asia-economy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"20 Oct 2022 \u2014 The global population has doubled, and the global GDP has increased almost fourfold in volume since the 1980s, but where is the strongest ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Global GDP over the long run","url":"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"This global GDP indicator provides information on global economic growth and income levels in the very long run.

In its annual report, the EBRD projects that a shrinking working-age population could reduce annual per capita GDP growth by an average of 0.4 percentage points from 2024 to 2050. EBRD Chief Economist Beata Javorcik emphasized that demographic shifts are already reducing living standards and will increasingly hinder economic performance. Many post-communist nations now face the challenge of ageing before achieving high income levels, with inadequate birth rates and limited political support for compensating measures like increased migration or AI-driven productivity. The most viable solution appears to be extending working lives, supported by retraining and pension reform. Additionally, older political leaders and electorates tend to resist necessary reforms. The report also highlights a brief opportunity for younger, growing nations such as Nigeria to benefit from a demographic dividend, which may quickly vanish as birth rates decline.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Ageing populations will lead to lower living standards, warns study","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/3a675f7f-ff46-4b8d-9744-08dfed18d23a?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"A report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) warns that ageing populations in Europe and other regions will lead to declining living standards and lower GDP per capita growth.

Advanced economies like South Korea, Italy, Spain, China, Japan, and Germany will also be strongly impacted. With older voters gaining influence, governments are increasingly struggling to implement needed reforms such as raising retirement ages or boosting immigration. The report notes that public opinion heavily favors healthcare and pension spending over education, further complicating long-term strategies. While artificial intelligence might help partially mitigate productivity losses, it cannot fully offset demographic challenges. The EBRD urges immediate action, emphasizing that post-communist countries are ageing before achieving high levels of wealth, and current policy decisions will heavily impact younger generations in the decades to come.","attribution":"Financial Times"},{"title":"Chapter 2: The Rise of the Silver Economy: Global ...","url":"https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/weo/2025/april/english/ch2.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Population aging has often been linked to gloomy prospects for economic growth and public finances.

This marks the slowest growth outside of recessions since 2008 and positions the 2020s to be the weakest economic decade since the 1960s. The twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report highlights that investment, trade, and development progress, especially in developing nations outside Asia, have significantly slowed. Chief Economist Indermit Gill noted the sharp decline in economic growth in developing economies\u2014from 6% in the 2000s to under 4% in the 2020s. The report warns that key drivers of past global economic rise, such as increased productivity and expanded trade, are now reversing. Governments are urged to resolve trade disputes, reform fiscal policies, and attract investment. Risks such as escalating tariffs and policy uncertainty could further hinder growth. Additionally, over half of low-income nations face debt distress, worsened by reduced aid from developed countries.

Projected growth for these economies is 3.8%, down from 4.2% in 2024, with per capita income growth falling to 2.9%. Overall global growth will be the slowest since 2008 outside of recession years. The slowdown reverses the benefits of globalization, which had significantly reduced extreme poverty and boosted GDP in developing nations in past decades. Foreign direct investment into these regions has halved since its 2008 peak, and further risks include rising trade barriers, geopolitical tensions, and policy uncertainty. The World Bank emphasizes that while high-income countries have regained their pre-pandemic economic trajectory, developing nations, excluding China, may take two decades to recover. Despite the gloomy outlook, emerging markets' financial assets have surged in 2025, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar and possible tariff rollbacks. Many of these countries now have stronger economic fundamentals, aided by improved fiscal management and inflation control over the past decade. Nonetheless, sustained global cooperation is needed to restore a stable trade environment and support struggling nations.","attribution":"Financial Times"},{"title":"Most of the developing world is turning into a ...","url":"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/voices/most-of-the-developing-world-is-turning-into-a-development-free-zone?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"10 Jun 2025 \u2014 By 2027, global GDP growth is expected to average just 2.5 percent in the 2020s\u2014the slowest pace of any decade since the 1960s.

Only 30% of the increase has come from real investment, while rising asset values have also fueled a surge in global debt to 2.6 times GDP. McKinsey warns this imbalance makes the global economy vulnerable, with future financial stability hinging on whether productivity\u2014potentially through AI innovations\u2014can close the gap, or if prolonged inflation will erode wealth.

This marks the slowest growth outside of recessions since 2008 and positions the 2020s to be the weakest economic decade since the 1960s. The twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report highlights that investment, trade, and development progress, especially in developing nations outside Asia, have significantly slowed. Chief Economist Indermit Gill noted the sharp decline in economic growth in developing economies\u2014from 6% in the 2000s to under 4% in the 2020s. The report warns that key drivers of past global economic rise, such as increased productivity and expanded trade, are now reversing.

Projected growth for these economies is 3.8%, down from 4.2% in 2024, with per capita income growth falling to 2.9%. Overall global growth will be the slowest since 2008 outside of recession years. The slowdown reverses the benefits of globalization, which had significantly reduced extreme poverty and boosted GDP in developing nations in past decades. Foreign direct investment into these regions has halved since its 2008 peak, and further risks include rising trade barriers, geopolitical tensions, and policy uncertainty. The World Bank emphasizes that while high-income countries have regained their pre-pandemic economic trajectory, developing nations, excluding China, may take two decades to recover. Despite the gloomy outlook, emerging markets' financial assets have surged in 2025, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar and possible tariff rollbacks. Many of these countries now have stronger economic fundamentals, aided by improved fiscal management and inflation control over the past decade.

Overall, women\u2019s workforce participation has risen from 45.1% to 47.9%, but they still account for a smaller share of total hours worked (42.9%) due to a higher tendency to work part-time.\n\nThe gender gap in hours worked is closing faster than the headcount-based measure and could reach parity by the late 2040s. Notable growth has occurred among women over 55, with participation rising from 48% to 64% over two decades. AI Group credits this improvement to workplace cultural changes, increased STEM education uptake, technological advancements making jobs more accessible, expanded childcare, and parental leave policies. Female-dominated fields like healthcare and education see women contributing over 70% of work hours, while gender-balanced sectors show a 45-55% female share.

This marks the slowest growth outside of recessions since 2008 and positions the 2020s to be the weakest economic decade since the 1960s. The twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report highlights that investment, trade, and development progress, especially in developing nations outside Asia, have significantly slowed. Chief Economist Indermit Gill noted the sharp decline in economic growth in developing economies\u2014from 6% in the 2000s to under 4% in the 2020s. The report warns that key drivers of past global economic rise, such as increased productivity and expanded trade, are now reversing. Governments are urged to resolve trade disputes, reform fiscal policies, and attract investment. Risks such as escalating tariffs and policy uncertainty could further hinder growth. Additionally, over half of low-income nations face debt distress, worsened by reduced aid from developed countries. Campaigners are calling for renewed international efforts to tackle sovereign debt ahead of a key finance conference in Seville.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Most of the developing world is turning into a ...","url":"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/voices/most-of-the-developing-world-is-turning-into-a-development-free-zone?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"10 Jun 2025 \u2014 By 2027, global GDP growth is expected to average just 2.5 percent in the 2020s\u2014the slowest pace of any decade since the 1960s.

6,602.99. The forecast is driven by strong corporate earnings and momentum from artificial intelligence (AI)-related investments, marking the most bullish prediction among major global brokerages. Deutsche Bank also anticipates S&P 500 earnings per share to reach $320. Meanwhile, HSBC projects a slightly lower year-end 2026 target of 7,500, also attributing gains to AI growth. In 2025, the S&P 500 has already gained 12.3%, fueled by investor enthusiasm over AI, solid earnings, and expected interest rate cuts despite concerns over a potential market bubble. Leading the rally are mega-cap tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, with their AI-driven capital expenditures.

As of the third quarter of 2025, tech firms made up 20.8% of the S&P 500\u2019s earnings, down from 22.8% earlier in the year, yet their market capitalization share climbed to 31.1% from about 30%. This raises concerns that tech stock prices may be overinflated relative to profits.\n\nAnalysts suggest this valuation gap is partially justifiable due to expectations of future earnings and free cash flow growth, particularly from AI innovations, but warn it could also make indexes vulnerable to earnings disappointments. The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted in tech, trades at a high forward P/E ratio of 29.28, significantly above its 10-year average and the broader S&P 500\u2019s current multiple.\n\nAI-driven firms like Nvidia have propelled recent gains, but some experts caution that current profitability may be temporarily inflated by upfront AI-related capital expenditures.

However, this growth has been disproportionately driven by the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla\u2014buoyed by booming interest and corporate investment in artificial intelligence (AI). When excluding these companies, the \"S&P 493\" reveals a much weaker economy, with smaller and non-tech firms struggling amid rising tariffs, slowing growth, and flat capital expenditures.\n\nWhile AI has propelled soaring valuations for companies like Nvidia and Palantir, the broader market, particularly small- and mid-cap stocks represented by the Russell 2000, has lagged, reflecting poor earnings, high sensitivity to interest rates, and limited capacity to manage global trade shifts. Investors are increasingly concerned about the stock market's overreliance on AI-centered tech giants, warning that a potential \"AI bubble\" could destabilize markets, especially given recent pullbacks in major tech stocks and critiques of the sector\u2019s speculative spending.

This marks the slowest growth outside of recessions since 2008 and positions the 2020s to be the weakest economic decade since the 1960s. The twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report highlights that investment, trade, and development progress, especially in developing nations outside Asia, have significantly slowed. Chief Economist Indermit Gill noted the sharp decline in economic growth in developing economies\u2014from 6% in the 2000s to under 4% in the 2020s. The report warns that key drivers of past global economic rise, such as increased productivity and expanded trade, are now reversing.

is driving 'stretched' US tech valuations, ECB warns","snippet":"The European Central Bank (ECB) has issued a warning in its latest Financial Stability Review regarding the \"stretched\" valuations of US tech stocks, including companies like Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta. The high valuations are being driven by investor \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO) and excessive optimism about the global implementation and success of artificial intelligence (AI). The ECB noted that current market pricing fails to reflect ongoing vulnerabilities and uncertainties amid a renewed risk-on sentiment post an April sell-off.\n\nWhile the ECB does not claim a bubble is forming, it cautions that a correction could occur if the optimistic AI scenario doesn't materialize. Unlike the dotcom boom of 2000, today\u2019s tech firms generally have strong business fundamentals, yet risks persist due to opaque private markets and potential liquidity pressures in European financial institutions. Additional concerns include US political interference with central bank independence, soaring US debt, and possible turmoil in the US Treasuries market\u2014risks that could impact global financial stability. The ECB also highlighted fiscal instability in some Eurozone countries, particularly France, as a threat to investor confidence and bond market stability.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1764147608.329,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/alphabet-races-toward-4-trillion-valuation-ai-fueled-gains-accelerate-2025-11-24/","title":"Alphabet races toward $4 trillion valuation as AI-fueled gains accelerate","snippet":"Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is nearing a $4 trillion market valuation, driven by a surge in artificial intelligence-related investments and innovations. On Monday, its stock rose over 5% to a record high of $315.9, pushing its market cap to $3.82 trillion and marking a 70% gain in 2025\u2014outpacing AI competitors like Microsoft and Amazon. If Alphabet crosses the $4 trillion mark, it will join Nvidia and Apple, the only companies currently in that valuation tier.\n\nThis rise marks a comeback for Alphabet, which faced skepticism post-2022 when OpenAI's ChatGPT raised concerns about Google's AI leadership. However, renewed momentum from its successful Gemini 3 AI model and the transformation of its cloud division into a key growth driver\u2014boosted by investor confidence from Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment\u2014has reignited market enthusiasm. Although legal scrutiny over its search monopoly continues, Alphabet has avoided drastic regulatory actions.\n\nDespite concerns about inflated tech valuations reminiscent of the dot-com era, analysts highlight Alphabet\u2019s strong fundamentals, including significant cash flow, proprietary chips that rival Nvidia's, and profitable AI-enhanced services, especially in search.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1764002972.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/24/sp500-stock-market-tech-nvidia/","title":"The 'S&P 493' reveals a very different U.S. economy","snippet":"In 2025, the U.S. stock market appears strong on the surface, with the S&P 500 up over 12% for the year.

When excluding these companies, the \"S&P 493\" reveals a much weaker economy, with smaller and non-tech firms struggling amid rising tariffs, slowing growth, and flat capital expenditures.\n\nWhile AI has propelled soaring valuations for companies like Nvidia and Palantir, the broader market, particularly small- and mid-cap stocks represented by the Russell 2000, has lagged, reflecting poor earnings, high sensitivity to interest rates, and limited capacity to manage global trade shifts. Investors are increasingly concerned about the stock market's overreliance on AI-centered tech giants, warning that a potential \"AI bubble\" could destabilize markets, especially given recent pullbacks in major tech stocks and critiques of the sector\u2019s speculative spending.

Having worked with machine learning for over a decade, he believes AI is set to radically reshape markets, geopolitics, and global economic growth.\n\nJensen highlighted that leading AI figures, including Elon Musk and Sam Altman, see AI\u2019s development as having existential stakes, which means traditional financial constraints won\u2019t slow investment. This mindset has led to an unprecedented \"resource grab\" phase, creating bottlenecks in power, land, chips, and elite AI talent worldwide. He noted that fewer than a thousand people globally are on the cutting edge of AI science.\n\nJensen also warned that AI-related investments are already significantly affecting macroeconomic indicators, including contributing about one percentage point to U.S. GDP growth. However, most investors are still overly focused on a few AI leaders and fail to understand how profoundly the sector is distorting broader financial markets.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1764244096.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.dbresearch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/RI-PROD/PROD0000000000604341/AI_and_energy_sectors__more_intertwined_than_ever.pdf","title":"AI and energy sectors more intertwined than ever","snippet":"29 Sept 2025 \u2014 2024.

The US still does better than most, but today\u2019s AI-centric valuations look very hard to justify.\n\nI\u2019ll go step by step.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the baseline currently assumes\n\nRight now, mainstream institutions are implicitly leaning on AI to rescue an otherwise mediocre outlook:\n\n- The World Bank expects global gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging only **~2.3\u20132.5%** this decade \u2013 the slowest since the 1960s \u2013 because the old drivers (trade, demographics, basic ICT) are fading.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search14\ue201  \n- A lot of the upside discussion is basically: \u201cAI might add back roughly **0.3\u20131.0 percentage points** per year to labour productivity in advanced economies over the next decade.\u201d  \n  - OECD work on G7 economies estimates AI could raise annual labour productivity by **0.4\u20131.3 percentage points** in high-exposure countries like the US and UK under rapid adoption, and **0.2\u20130.4** under a slow-adoption scenario.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search20\ue202turn1search10\ue201  \n  - McKinsey\u2019s numbers translate to **0.1\u20130.6 percentage points** extra labour productivity per year globally from generative AI.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n\nAt the same time:\n\n- Data-centre electricity use is projected by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to **more than double by 2030** to around **945 terawatt-hours**, roughly Japan\u2019s current consumption, with AI the main driver; in the US, data centres alone could account for **nearly half of incremental electricity demand** to 2030.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn2search10\ue202turn2search26\ue201  \n\nMarkets are pricing in *both*:\n\n1. A meaningful AI-driven productivity uplift, and  \n2. The idea that we *will* successfully build the energy and infrastructure needed to support it.\n\nYour scenario says: **both of those are too optimistic.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Step 1 \u2013 Take away most of the AI uplift\n\n### 2.1 What \u201cslow adoption\u201d actually means in macro terms\n\nSuppose instead of the 0.4\u20131.3 percentage point boost for a country like the US, you get something like **0\u20130.2 percentage points** over 10 years \u2013 i.e. more of a \u201cnice tool in some workflows\u201d scenario, not a general-purpose technology that rewires the economy.\n\nBack-of-envelope:\n\n- If trend real GDP growth in advanced economies without AI is **~1.5\u20131.8%**, then:\n  - **With strong AI**: maybe **~2.2\u20132.5%**.  \n  - **With anaemic AI**: you stay near **~1.5\u20131.8%**.  \n- Over 10 years, that\u2019s the difference between being maybe **8\u201310% richer** vs only **3\u20135% richer** than the no-AI baseline. (Directionally, not a forecast.)\n\nGlobally, World Bank-style **2.3\u20132.5%** growth becomes something closer to **2.0\u20132.3%** for the 2030s if there is no significant AI tailwind to offset ageing and weaker trade.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search14\ue201  \n\n### 2.2 Second-order: capital misallocation and write-offs\n\nIf enterprise adoption is slower *after* a huge capital expenditure (capex) wave, you add classic boom-bust dynamics:\n\n- Hyperscalers and chipmakers have already embarked on an enormous build-out: one analysis puts potential US data-centre capex at **~$1.8 trillion between 2024\u20132030** in a mid-range AI demand scenario.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn2search8\ue201  \n- If monetisation lags, a non-trivial share of that becomes **stranded or low-return capital**: overcapacity in chips, underutilised AI clusters, write-downs in \u201cAI platform\u201d bets that never found paying customers.\n\nMacro effect: **lower measured productivity and weaker corporate profits** than investors expected, exactly when the demographic and debt headwinds are biting.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Step 2 \u2013 Make energy and infrastructure binding constraints\n\nRight now even bullish reports admit that AI is driving a *huge* load on grids:\n\n- IEA base case: data-centre electricity consumption doubles to **945 TWh** by 2030 (~3% of global use), with AI responsible for a rising share; data-centre load is growing at **~15% per year**, 4\u00d7 faster than overall electricity demand.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn2search14\ue202turn2search26\ue201  \n- In the US, data centres already use about **4% of electricity** and could more than double their share by 2030, with some estimates implying **8\u201312%** of US demand by then.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search21\ue202turn2search25\ue202turn2search18\ue201  \n- Forecasts suggest grid power for US data centres may need to **roughly triple by 2030**.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search13\ue201  \n\nYour scenario assumes *we do not keep up* \u2013 meaning:\n\n1. **Localised power constraints and project delays**\n   - Permitting, community opposition, and transmission build-out already lag demand; add more pressure from AI and electrification (electric vehicles, heat pumps), and you get **bottlenecked regions** (e.g. Northern Virginia, parts of Texas, Ireland, the Netherlands).\n   - AI/data-centre projects get delayed, curtailed, or forced into higher-cost locations.\n\n2. **Higher electricity prices and more volatile supply**\n   - Tight local grids + heavy baseload from data centres + policy limits on new fossil generation \u2192 **higher marginal power prices** and potential reliability issues.\n   - This raises input costs for *all* energy-intensive sectors, not just AI.\n\n3. **Forced reallocation of capex**\n   - A bigger share of global investment has to go into **grid reinforcement, generation, transmission and local infrastructure**, rather than productivity-enhancing capital elsewhere.\n   - On paper that\u2019s still GDP, but it\u2019s partly **\u201crepair and catch-up\u201d investment** just to avoid outages.\n\nNet result: the AI build-out becomes **self-limiting** \u2013 energy and infrastructure shortfalls slow AI deployment, while the spending required to fix those shortfalls doesn\u2019t obviously raise total factor productivity (TFP) much.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Step 3 \u2013 What happens when the AI equity bubble leaks air\n\n### 4.1 Starting point: very AI-concentrated, expensive US market\n\nRight now:\n\n- The \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla) plus a few others are responsible for a **disproportionate share of US equity gains** since 2023 and represent roughly **35\u201338%** of S&P 500 market capitalisation.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn1news51\ue202turn1news53\ue202turn2news40\ue201  \n- US tech and communication services\u2019 **share of S&P 500 earnings is ~21%**, but their **market-cap share is ~31%**, indicating valuations are stretched relative to current profit contribution.\ue200cite\ue202turn1news52\ue201  \n- The European Central Bank\u2019s latest financial-stability review explicitly warns that US tech valuations are \u201c**stretched**\u201d and driven by fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) on AI, and that a correction is likely if AI underdelivers.\ue200cite\ue202turn2news38\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n- Large AI \u201chyperscalers\u201d are trading around **26\u00d7 two-year forward price-to-earnings (P/E)**, substantially above long-run averages and well above the broader market.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search19\ue202turn1news52\ue201  \n\nSo you have a **high-duration, AI-premium segment** that drives both index levels and household wealth effects.\n\n### 4.2 If the hype deflates\n\nIn your scenario:\n\n- Firms discover that deploying AI into core workflows is harder, riskier and more expensive than expected.\n- Productivity gains are narrower, concentrated in a few niches (coding, customer support, content generation), with **limited broad-based earnings uplift**.\n- Energy and infrastructure issues delay or cap large-scale rollouts.\n\nMarket reaction is not subtle:\n\n1. **Multiple compression in AI leaders**\n   - If the \u201cjustified\u201d forward P/E on the AI hyperscalers is, say, 18\u201320\u00d7 given their growth and risk, but they\u2019re trading 25\u201330\u00d7, you can easily see **20\u201340% downside** on valuation reset *even if earnings hold up*.  \n   - For more speculative AI-linked names with weak cash flow, drawdowns of **50\u201380%** are entirely plausible; we\u2019ve seen that movie in 2000 and again in various bubbles.\n\n2. **Index-level drag**\n   - When ~35\u201340% of index weight corrects sharply, the S&P 500 is not going to shrug it off. Even if the \u201cS&P 493\u201d (the rest of the index) stays flat, a 30% hit to AI leaders alone could translate into **~10\u201315% index-level downside**; if the non-AI sectors also derate in sympathy or on macro weakness, you\u2019re talking **20\u201330%+ peak-to-trough** risk.\n\n3. **Wealth effects and risk appetite**\n   - US consumption is sensitive to equity wealth for higher-income cohorts (who hold most of the stock). An AI-led correction hits those balance sheets, reducing discretionary spending and willingness to fund risky ventures.\n   - Credit spreads widen as equity investors reprice risk; some late-cycle AI capex or start-up funding windows close entirely.\n\n### 4.3 Longer-run US equity returns in this regime\n\nExpected 10-year real returns on equities are heavily influenced by **starting valuations + earnings growth**:\n\n- If global GDP growth settles at **~2%**, US real GDP at **~1.5\u20132%**, and you remove most of the \u201cAI miracle\u201d narrative, then long-run *earnings* growth for US corporates probably sits in the **3\u20135% nominal** range (real growth + inflation + some margin).\n- If the market re-rates from current elevated multiples down toward historical norms (say, from mid-20s to high teens on forward P/E at the index level), you get a **valuation headwind** over the next decade.\n\nSo in your scenario, US equities likely shift from a regime of:\n\n> \u201cDouble-digit nominal returns driven by multiple expansion + earnings growth\u201d\n\nto one more like:\n\n> \u201cMid-single-digit nominal returns (say 4\u20137% annually), heavily back-loaded and lumpy, with one or two significant drawdowns as AI optimism deflates.\u201d\n\nWithin that, there\u2019s enormous dispersion:\n\n- Energy, utilities, grid-linked industrials and some real-asset plays could actually **outperform** as the bottleneck narrative plays out.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search17\ue202turn2search20\ue202turn2search18\ue201  \n- Pure-play AI infrastructure firms (chips, select data-centre plays) may still do reasonably well *if* they transition from \u201cgrowth at any price\u201d to \u201csteady, regulated-like returns\u201d.\n- The broad mass of \u201cAI-story\u201d equities with no enduring edge get crushed.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Global economy under this scenario\n\n### 5.1 Growth and inflation\n\nYou end up with a rather ugly mix:\n\n- **Lower trend growth** because:\n  - AI doesn\u2019t rescue productivity.  \n  - Demographics and de-globalisation continue to drag.  \n  - A lot of investment is defensive (keep the lights on, upgrade grids) rather than strongly productivity-raising.\n\n- **Sticky or volatile inflation**, not a neat return to 2%, because:\n  - Power and infrastructure constraints show up as **repeated supply shocks** \u2013 higher electricity prices, local outages, forced curtailment.\n  - Governments push big energy-transition programs and grid spending, which supports demand and can be inflationary in the short to medium term.\n\nCentral banks are then stuck between:\n\n- Weak real activity, and  \n- Periodic cost-push inflation from energy/infrastructure.\n\nThat combination is **not equity-friendly**; it resembles a mild, drawn-out version of stagflation.\n\n### 5.2 Regions\n\n- **United States**  \n  - Still a relative winner (rule of law, innovation system, reserve currency), but growth looks more like a **low-2% nominal + 1\u20131.5% real** slog than an AI-driven renaissance.  \n  - Fiscal strains (high debt, higher real rates) become more salient because there is no AI-boosted denominator to make debt ratios \u201cgrow away\u201d.\n\n- **Europe / UK / Japan**  \n  - Have ageing and structural issues *even more* than the US, plus fewer globally dominant tech champions.  \n  - Without a strong AI uplift, they risk **semi-permanent 1%-ish real growth**, with political tension as welfare demands collide with limited dynamism.\n\n- **China and other emerging markets**  \n  - China\u2019s structural slowdown (property, debt, demographics) is harder to offset without leveraging AI as a productivity lever; you get **weaker external demand** for commodities and capital goods.  \n  - Younger EMs (India, ASEAN, parts of Africa) still have demographic tailwinds, but they\u2019re trying to develop in a world of **sluggish trade, higher capital costs, and AI tools that are not diffusing as fast as advertised**.  \n\nWorld Bank-type warnings about the **2020s being the weakest growth decade since the 1960s** just extend into the 2030s: you risk **two weak decades in a row**.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search19\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 6. How this differs from a true \u201cAI bust\u201d apocalypse\n\nImportant nuance: this scenario is **not** \u201cAI turns out to be useless\u201d or \u201cmodels regress to GPT-2.\u201d It\u2019s:\n\n- AI is genuinely useful but **hard to scale**.  \n- Enterprises under-deliver on adoption because of skills, governance, legacy IT, and energy constraints.  \n- The *financial* hype got well ahead of the *operational* reality.\n\nSo:\n\n- The global economy doesn\u2019t collapse; it just stays stuck in **low gear**.  \n- US equities don\u2019t go to zero; they just likely deliver **much lower real returns from today\u2019s starting valuations**, with at least one serious AI-driven repricing event.  \n- Energy and infrastructure become the **new tech** \u2013 the scarce bottleneck where incremental profit pools and political fights concentrate.\n\n---\n\n## 7. If you want to model this more formally\n\nIf you want to push this further in a mathematical way, the clean way is to do a **growth-accounting exercise**:\n\n- Decompose GDP growth into:\n  - labour (L),  \n  - capital deepening (K),  \n  - and total factor productivity (TFP).  \n\nThen:\n\n- Take OECD / McKinsey estimates for AI TFP contributions and **cut them by 50\u2013100%** for your slow-adoption scenario.  \n- Impose an extra **\u201cinfrastructure tax\u201d**: assume a fixed fraction of investment goes into low-TFP grid/energy catch-up.  \n- Overlay a one-time **valuation multiple compression** for the AI-heavy equity sectors.\n\nYou\u2019d get a more precise sense of:\n\n- How much lower the path of GDP is vs a strong-AI world, and  \n- What kind of equity-return distribution is compatible with both the macro path and current starting valuations.\n\nIf you like, next step we can actually sketch such a model with concrete numbers (e.g. simple three-region world, stylised S&P 500 earnings and multiples) and see how sensitive things are to different AI and energy assumptions.\n\nFor some current discussions and data around AI valuations and growth assumptions, these are good jumping-off points:\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202AI valuations, energy constraints, and growth outlook\ue202turn2news38\ue205ECB warning on stretched US tech valuations and AI optimism\ue202turn1news52\ue205US tech earnings vs market cap disconnect in the S&P 500\ue202turn2news40\ue205\u201cS&P 493\u201d weakness under the surface of AI-driven rally\ue202turn1search9\ue205World Bank on weakest global growth decade since the 1960s\ue202turn2search6\ue205IEA on data-centre electricity demand doubling by 2030\ue202turn2search12\ue205BCG on $1.8 trillion US data-centre capex need by 2030\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search14\ue201","start_idx":719,"end_idx":765,"safe_urls":["https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/world-economy-world-bank-donald-trump-tariffs","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/world-economy-world-bank-donald-trump-tariffs?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/06/10/global-economic-prospects-june-2025-press-release","https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/06/10/global-economic-prospects-june-2025-press-release?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects","https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Global Economic Prospects - World Bank","url":"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Global Economy Set for Weakest Run Since 2008 Outside ...","url":"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/06/10/global-economic-prospects-june-2025-press-release?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"10 Jun 2025 \u2014 Global Economy Set for Weakest Run Since 2008 Outside of Recessions ... 2020s will be the slowest of any decade since the 1960s. \u201cOutside ...","attribution":"World Bank"},{"title":"2020s on course to be weakest decade for global economy since 1960s, says World Bank","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/world-economy-world-bank-donald-trump-tariffs?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The World Bank has downgraded its forecast for global economic growth in 2025 to 2.3%, citing sustained international trade tensions, particularly those stemming from former U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

Chief Economist Indermit Gill noted the sharp decline in economic growth in developing economies\u2014from 6% in the 2000s to under 4% in the 2020s. The report warns that key drivers of past global economic rise, such as increased productivity and expanded trade, are now reversing. Governments are urged to resolve trade disputes, reform fiscal policies, and attract investment. Risks such as escalating tariffs and policy uncertainty could further hinder growth.

This marks the slowest growth outside of recessions since 2008 and positions the 2020s to be the weakest economic decade since the 1960s. The twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report highlights that investment, trade, and development progress, especially in developing nations outside Asia, have significantly slowed. Chief Economist Indermit Gill noted the sharp decline in economic growth in developing economies\u2014from 6% in the 2000s to under 4% in the 2020s. The report warns that key drivers of past global economic rise, such as increased productivity and expanded trade, are now reversing. Governments are urged to resolve trade disputes, reform fiscal policies, and attract investment. Risks such as escalating tariffs and policy uncertainty could further hinder growth. Additionally, over half of low-income nations face debt distress, worsened by reduced aid from developed countries.

With the Nasdaq up 18.4% year-to-date but down over 3.5% in November, analysts predict a potential tech pullback if earnings growth lags, with the risk of declines ranging from mid-single digits to more than 10%.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":19},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"BlackRock"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search17\ue202turn2search20\ue202turn2search18\ue201","start_idx":9943,"end_idx":9991,"safe_urls":["https://am.jpmorgan.com/sg/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/energy-infrastructure-ais-power-play/","https://am.jpmorgan.com/sg/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/energy-infrastructure-ais-power-play/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/power-sector-update-generative-ai-has-written-the-check-but-can-the-power-sector-cash-it-s101649140","https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/power-sector-update-generative-ai-has-written-the-check-but-can-the-power-sector-cash-it-s101649140?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.sustainability.com/insights/data-center-power-crunch-meeting-the-power-demands-of-the-ai-era/","https://www.sustainability.com/insights/data-center-power-crunch-meeting-the-power-demands-of-the-ai-era/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([JPMorgan](https://am.jpmorgan.com/sg/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/energy-infrastructure-ais-power-play/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Energy Infrastructure: AI's power play","url":"https://am.jpmorgan.com/sg/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/energy-infrastructure-ais-power-play/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"This paper discusses the interplay between energy demand and AI data centers, energy supply and current constraints, and the investment implications.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Power Sector Update: Generative AI Has Written Th","url":"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/power-sector-update-generative-ai-has-written-the-check-but-can-the-power-sector-cash-it-s101649140?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"3 Oct 2025 \u2014 Data centers would further pressure an already strained grid.

This marks the slowest growth outside of recessions since 2008 and positions the 2020s to be the weakest economic decade since the 1960s. The twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report highlights that investment, trade, and development progress, especially in developing nations outside Asia, have significantly slowed. Chief Economist Indermit Gill noted the sharp decline in economic growth in developing economies\u2014from 6% in the 2000s to under 4% in the 2020s. The report warns that key drivers of past global economic rise, such as increased productivity and expanded trade, are now reversing. Governments are urged to resolve trade disputes, reform fiscal policies, and attract investment. Risks such as escalating tariffs and policy uncertainty could further hinder growth. Additionally, over half of low-income nations face debt distress, worsened by reduced aid from developed countries. Campaigners are calling for renewed international efforts to tackle sovereign debt ahead of a key finance conference in Seville.","attribution":"The Guardian"},{"title":"World Bank Warns 2020s Face Weakest Global Growth ...","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/world-bank-warns-2020s-face-weakest-global-growth-since-1960s?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"10 Jun 2025 \u2014 World Bank Warns 2020s Face Weakest Global Growth Since 1960s ...

reclassifies India's FX regime as 'crawl-like' from 'stabilised'","snippet":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reclassified India's \"de facto\" exchange rate regime from \"stabilised\" to a \"crawl-like arrangement,\" reflecting a shift in the rupee\u2019s behavior and India's foreign exchange policy. This classification means that the Indian rupee has consistently remained within a narrow margin of a statistically determined trend for over six months but still doesn't meet the criteria for being considered a floating currency. The IMF noted an increase in exchange rate flexibility and rupee volatility since Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra took office, although the central bank continues to intervene in the forex market to manage excessive fluctuations. The rupee recently hit a record low of 89.49/$ amid high U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe IMF recommends further rate cuts by India\u2019s central bank, citing low inflation, and supports a conditional fiscal consolidation plan starting April 2026. It projects Indian GDP to grow by 6.6% in FY 2025-26 and 6.2% the following year. Recent tax reforms are expected to offset negative impacts from the U.S. tariffs, but risks remain from geopolitical tensions and adverse weather affecting agriculture and inflation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1764172421.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/south-korea-tighten-household-borrowing-rules-second-half-2025-02-27/","title":"South Korea to tighten household borrowing rules from second half","snippet":"South Korea is set to tighten household borrowing rules from July to manage the rise in household debt. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced the move in anticipation of potential further easing of monetary policy by the central bank. The \"stress debt-to-service ratios\" rule, which accounts for the risk of borrowing cost fluctuations, will be reinforced. This rule was initially introduced in February 2024 and further tightened in September, amid concerns over the high household debt levels in the economy. The FSC aims to limit household debt growth to 3.8% for the year, aligning it with nominal economic growth, to maintain the household debt to GDP ratio at around 90.5%. The Bank of Korea has indicated plans for additional interest rate cuts, having already reduced the benchmark rate to 2.75%. By the end of 2024, South Korea's household debt reached 1,927.3 trillion won ($1.34 trillion), a 2.2% increase from the previous year.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51},"pub_date":1740622943.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/imf-upgrades-asias-growth-forecast-warns-risks-2025-10-16/","title":"IMF upgrades Asia's growth forecast, warns of risks","snippet":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its 2025 economic growth forecast for Asia upward to 4.5%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points from its April estimate, despite projecting a slight slowdown from 4.6% in 2024. Asia-Pacific is again on track to contribute about 60% of global growth both in 2025 and 2026, according to Krishna Srinivasan, director of the IMF\u2019s Asia Pacific Department. The stronger outlook is fueled by robust exports\u2014partly due to companies accelerating shipments ahead of tariff increases\u2014and a surge in intra-regional trade and technological advances, particularly in AI-driven sectors in South Korea and Japan. The region also benefitted from booming equity markets, declining long-term borrowing costs, and a weak dollar. However, the IMF warns that risks remain tilted to the downside amid ongoing uncertainty around U.S. trade policies and geopolitical tensions. There is also concern that interest rates could climb, tightening financial conditions and increasing debt burdens. Srinivasan emphasized the need for continued reforms to strengthen trade and investment, which are critical for sustaining long-term growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52},"pub_date":1760620805.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.imf.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2024/07/31/pr24295-china-imf-exec-board-concludes-2024-art-iv-consult","title":"IMF Executive Board Concludes 2024 Article IV ...","snippet":"2 Aug 2024 \u2014 Nonetheless, Directors emphasized downside risks from the ongoing adjustment in the property market and the drag from local government debt.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.imf.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/publications/reo/apac/issues/2024/10/31/regional-economic-outlook-for-asia-and-pacific-october-2024","title":"Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and Pacific ...","snippet":"Short-term prospects for Asia and the Pacific have improved slightly, even though growth is still expected to moderate in 2024 and 2025.

The danger now is more \u201cslow-burn balance-sheet and growth crisis\u201d + episodic flare-ups than a single sudden stop event.\n\nI\u2019ll go in layers:\n\n1. What actually happened in 1997/98 (mechanics of the old crisis)  \n2. How Asia\u2019s macro structure has changed  \n3. China as today\u2019s epicentre candidate  \n4. Other Asia: Korea and ASEAN  \n5. Contagion and what a \u201cmodern Asian crisis\u201d would actually look like  \n\n---\n\n## 1. The 1997/98 template\n\nThe 1997\u201398 Asian Financial Crisis was driven by three classic ingredients:\ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search7\ue202turn3search12\ue201  \n\n1. **Fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rates to the US dollar**  \n   - Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea etc. tried to keep their currencies tightly pegged or managed against the dollar.\n\n2. **Large short-term foreign-currency borrowing**  \n   - Corporates and banks borrowed heavily in dollars, often unhedged.  \n   - When sentiment turned, foreign lenders pulled back (\u201csudden stop\u201d), local currencies collapsed, and the real value of dollar debt exploded.\n\n3. **Weak financial systems and governance**  \n   - Crony lending, connected borrowers, concentrated property bets.  \n   - Poor supervision, opaque balance sheets, and undercapitalised banks.\n\nTrigger: Thailand devalued the baht in July 1997; markets extrapolated similar problems across the region; capital rushed out; currencies and banking systems imploded.\n\nSo: **FX pegs + foreign-currency debt + fragile banks + herd behaviour.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Today\u2019s Asia: what\u2019s changed and what hasn\u2019t\n\n### What\u2019s fundamentally different now\n\n1. **Exchange-rate regimes**\n   - Most Asian economies now have **more flexible exchange rates**, not hard pegs. They let currencies move rather than defending a fixed level until reserves are gone.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn3search6\ue201  \n\n2. **Foreign-exchange (FX) reserves**\n   - After 1997, governments deliberately built large FX reserves as self-insurance.  \n   - China (~US$3tn+), Japan (~US$1tn), India (~US$600bn) and others hold far more reserves relative to short-term external debt than in the 1990s.\n\n3. **External balance sheets**\n   - Short-term foreign-currency debt is lower and better structured.  \n   - Many Asian countries run **current-account surpluses or small deficits**, not the large deficits of pre-1997.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn3search11\ue201  \n\n4. **Policy frameworks**\n   - Widespread adoption of **inflation targeting**, more independent central banks, and macro-prudential tools (e.g. limits on FX borrowing, loan-to-value caps).\ue200cite\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3search4\ue201  \n\nThese differences make a straight-up 1997-style currency and external-debt crisis much less likely in most of emerging Asia.\n\n### What is *worse* now\n\n1. **Total leverage and domestic debt**\n   - China\u2019s total non-financial debt is close to 300% of gross domestic product (GDP), with big concentrations in property developers, local governments and state-owned firms.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue202turn3search10\ue201  \n   - South Korea\u2019s household debt is around **90% of GDP** and rising; authorities are tightening rules to contain it.\ue200cite\ue202turn3news51\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search13\ue201  \n   - Several ASEAN countries have seen sharp increases in property and consumer credit since the global financial crisis (GFC).\ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search14\ue201  \n\n2. **Demographics**\n   - North-East Asia (China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan) is ageing rapidly, which slows trend growth and makes high debt harder to grow out of.\n\n3. **Global backdrop**\n   - Interest rates are structurally higher than in the 2010s, and trade is more politicised (US-China rivalry, sanctions, export controls).\ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3news52\ue201  \n\nSo: Asia\u2019s **external** fragilities are smaller; its **internal balance-sheet** and growth fragilities are larger.\n\n---\n\n## 3. China as the new epicentre candidate\n\nIf you are looking for a modern analogue to pre-1997 Thailand \u2013 a big domestic credit boom that then goes wrong \u2013 the obvious candidate is **China**.\n\n### Where China actually is now\n\n- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2024 Article IV report on China notes that:  \n  - Growth in 2023 was **5.2%**, but driven partly by post-pandemic reopening.  \n  - There are serious **downside risks from the property market correction and local government debt**.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue202turn3search10\ue201  \n- Property and related activities still account for a very large slice of GDP (estimates ~20% or more, depending on definition).  \n- Local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) are heavily indebted and reliant on land-sale revenues that have collapsed.\n\nSo structurally you have:\n\n- A **property bust + over-indebted local governments + slowing trend growth**.\n\n### Why this is *not* 1997\n\nKey differences:\n\n1. **Debt is mainly domestic and in local currency (renminbi)**  \n   - Unlike 1997 Thailand or Indonesia, China\u2019s government, banks and most corporates borrow primarily in their own currency and from domestic savers.  \n   - This makes a classic foreign-currency solvency crisis less likely; instead you get *internal* redistribution (via inflation, financial repression, or implicit bailouts).\n\n2. **Capital account is controlled**\n   - China has meaningful capital controls; it\u2019s not as open to hot money flows as the 1990s ASEAN economies were. That doesn\u2019t eliminate outflow risk, but it gives authorities more tools to pace it.\n\n3. **State dominance of banking system**\n   - The big banks are state-owned and can be forced to roll over loans, support government priorities and undergo gradual recapitalisations if needed.\n\nWhat this points to is more like: **\u201cslow Japanification\u201d or periodic domestic crises**, rather than a single massive external default.\n\n### But there *are* systemic risk scenarios\n\nYou can still construct nasty tails:\n\n- A **disorderly confidence shock** (e.g. mishandled property bailout, political event, or geopolitical crisis) leads to:  \n  - accelerated capital outflows via whatever channels exist,  \n  - sharp renminbi depreciation,  \n  - and global risk-off in any asset tied to China demand.\n\nEven without outright crisis, a prolonged Chinese slowdown \u2013 say trend growth falling toward **2\u20133%** \u2013 is a big drag on Asian and global demand, especially for commodities and capital goods.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search6\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Other Asia: where are the weak spots?\n\n### South Korea\n\n- The IMF\u2019s 2025 Article IV assessment describes South Korea\u2019s financial stability risks as \u201cmanageable\u201d, but flags **high household debt** as a key vulnerability.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search8\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \n- Household debt is ~90% of GDP; regulators are tightening stress tests and debt-service rules.\ue200cite\ue202turn3news51\ue201  \n- External position: Korea has a flexible exchange rate, large FX reserves, and a strong export base (chips, autos, electronics).  \n\nCrisis style if things go wrong: **domestic demand squeeze + property price correction**, not 1997-style external default. Still painful, but more like a deep recession and banking clean-up than a multi-country melt-down.\n\n### ASEAN-4 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand)\n\nIMF and regional surveillance (for example ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office) paint a mixed picture:\ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search14\ue201  \n\n- Positives:\n  - More flexible exchange rates.  \n  - Bigger FX reserves and better-managed external debt.  \n  - Better banking regulation than in the 1990s.\n\n- Vulnerabilities:\n  - High openness to trade and capital flows makes them sensitive to **global risk-off** and interest-rate shocks.  \n  - Property-related credit booms in some markets.  \n  - Fiscal space is limited in a few countries.\n\nSo you can absolutely get **country-specific mini-crises** (sharp depreciation, IMF program, domestic austerity) in one or two weaker states \u2013 think more Sri Lanka-style episodes than pan-Asian 1997/98.\n\n### India\n\nNot part of the 1997 crisis, and structurally different:\n\n- More domestically driven growth.  \n- Capital account less open than, say, ASEAN-4.  \n- FX regime has become gradually more flexible; the IMF now classifies it as a \u201ccrawl-like\u201d arrangement, meaning the rupee moves within a trend band.\ue200cite\ue202turn3news49\ue201  \n\nIndia can certainly have its own crises, but it is **not** the primary candidate for an Asia-wide 1997 rerun.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Contagion mechanics now vs 1997\n\n### Then (1997/98)\n\n- **Common vulnerability**: fixed dollar pegs + short-term dollar debt.  \n- Thailand devalues \u2192 everyone asks \u201cwho\u2019s next?\u201d \u2192 investors exit similar markets \u2192 self-fulfilling spiral.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search12\ue201  \n\n### Now\n\nThe \u201ccommon factor\u201d is different:\n\n1. **China growth + demand channel**\n   - A sharp Chinese slowdown or property-led recession cuts import demand, tourism and commodity demand across Asia and beyond.  \n   - Exporters to China (Korea, Taiwan, ASEAN, Australia, Brazil, parts of Africa) get hit; that reduces growth, widens fiscal deficits and weakens currencies \u2013 even without a sudden stop.\n\n2. **Risk-off and asset-price channel**\n   - A serious China event (or Taiwan crisis) would trigger **global risk aversion**:  \n     - Emerging Asia equities and bonds sell off as an asset class.  \n     - Currencies weaken, yields rise.  \n     - Some countries with weaker fundamentals could be pushed into crisis.\n\n3. **Geopolitical escalation**\n   - A Taiwan blockade or major US\u2013China sanctions escalation is not a 1997-style financial story at all; it\u2019s worse:  \n     - semiconductor supply shock,  \n     - trade rerouting,  \n     - forced decoupling in technology and finance.\n\nIn other words, **contagion is less about shared FX pegs and more about shared exposure to China + global risk sentiment + supply chains + geopolitics.**\n\n---\n\n## 6. So: how real is the risk of \u201canother 1997/98\u201d?\n\nI\u2019d break it down like this:\n\n### Low probability: carbon-copy 1997/98\n\n- Multiple Asian currencies defending hard pegs to the dollar until reserves are exhausted.  \n- Systemic short-term dollar debt that can\u2019t be rolled.  \n- Serial IMF rescues and double-digit GDP contractions across several countries.\n\nThis is **unlikely** in the big Asian economies because:\n\n- FX regimes are more flexible.  \n- FX reserves are abundant relative to short-term external debt.  \n- External vulnerabilities are lower than in the mid-1990s.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search11\ue201  \n\n### Medium probability: **slow-burn China + rolling mini-crises**\n\n- China goes through a long property and local-government balance-sheet workout, with growth drifting down into low single digits.  \n- This drags on Asian and global growth for a decade (Japan-style), but is managed domestically through state banks, capital controls and gradual restructuring.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue202turn3search10\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search6\ue201  \n- Along the way, one or two smaller or weaker Asian economies face classic sudden-stop episodes and need external support.  \n\nThis is **quite plausible** and arguably close to the IMF\u2019s \u201cdownside but not tail\u201d view.\n\n### Tail risk: **geopolitical or confidence shock**\n\n- A major Taiwan crisis or US\u2013China financial decoupling triggers:  \n  - a collapse in cross-border capital flows,  \n  - semiconductor and trade disruption,  \n  - synchronised risk-off in all emerging markets.  \n\nThis is not \u201c1997 redux\u201d \u2013 structurally it\u2019s more profound \u2013 but it would absolutely look like an Asia-centric shock in global markets.\n\n---\n\n## 7. How this interacts with your earlier AI/energy-bottleneck scenario\n\nIf you combine:\n\n- **AI under-delivery + energy bottlenecks** (low global productivity, tighter real rates) with  \n- **China slow-burn + occasional Asia flare-ups**,\n\nyou end up with:\n\n- A global economy stuck around **2% real growth or lower**, with Asia still contributing a lot but less than its potential.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3news52\ue201  \n- Repeated risk-off waves where Asian assets are hit, with safe-haven flows into US Treasuries and to some extent the dollar and gold.  \n- US and European equities facing **both** lower growth **and** occasional shocks from Asian events, on top of any AI de-rating.\n\nSo instead of a single 1997-style crack, the more realistic threat is **a decade of under-performance and intermittently severe episodes**, anchored by China\u2019s adjustment and regional spillovers.\n\nFor current, fairly sober views from official and market sources on Asia\u2019s balance-sheet and contagion risks, these are useful:\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Asia risk and contagion: recent

yes: you\u2019re pointing at *the* structural headwinds of the 21st century. But it\u2019s worth being sharper about **what \u201ctake center stage\u201d actually means**, where your statement is solid, and where uncertainty and countervailing forces (AI, energy tech, institutional adaptation) matter.\n\nI\u2019ll break it into three claims:\n\n1. Demographics as a structural drag  \n2. Globalisation reversal / geo-economic fragmentation  \n3. Multipolarity and the end of the US-centric \u201ccheap-risk\u201d world  \n\nThen I\u2019ll synthesise how central these are likely to be relative to other forces.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Demographic headwinds \u2013 this one is basically locked in\n\n### What\u2019s happening\n\n- Advanced economies (US, Europe, Japan, Korea) *and* China are all shifting into **rapid population ageing and, in many cases, outright population decline** this century.  \n- The working-age population share is shrinking in most of the OECD and in China; only parts of South Asia, Africa, and some ASEAN countries still enjoy a demographic dividend.\n\nEmpirically, bodies like the EBRD, OECD, and IMF are already quantifying this: ageing subtracts on the order of **0.3\u20130.7 percentage points from annual GDP per-capita growth** in affected regions if nothing else changes, simply because there are fewer workers per retiree and more fiscal pressure from pensions/healthcare (numbers vary by study and region, but that\u2019s the ballpark).\ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn1news42\ue201  \n\n### Reversibility?\n\nAlmost none of this is reversible on a 20\u201330 year horizon:\n\n- Fertility decisions today change the labour force **20+ years** from now.  \n- Immigration can mitigate but not fully offset demographic decline for all rich countries simultaneously\u2014there aren\u2019t enough high-productivity migrants to go around, and political tolerance for large inflows is limited.\n\n**So yes:** demographic headwinds are **structural, slow-moving and dominant** for most of the century in the rich world and China. The only real offset is **productivity growth** (AI, biotech, new industrial organisation) and policy adaptation (retirement ages, labour participation, smarter welfare). They don\u2019t vanish; you can only outrun or cushion them.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Globalisation reversal / geo-economic fragmentation \u2013 highly likely to remain central, but the *degree* is uncertain\n\n### Direction of travel\n\nWe\u2019re clearly past the high tide of \u201chyper-globalisation\u201d (roughly 1990\u20132008):\n\n- Trade-to-GDP ratios plateaued after the global financial crisis.  \n- US\u2013China rivalry has produced **tariffs, tech export controls, investment screening, supply-chain \u201cde-risking\u201d / friend-shoring**.  \n- Institutions from the IMF to the World Bank and OECD are now publishing scenarios where **\u201csevere fragmentation\u201d cuts 2\u20137% off global GDP in the long run**, with some countries losing much more depending on their exposure.\ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search7\ue202turn4search11\ue201  \n\nThis is not a blip. The underlying drivers are:\n\n- Security concerns (chips, energy, critical minerals, data).  \n- Domestic politics (populism, inequality, backlash against offshoring).  \n- Strategic competition (US vs China, Russia vs West, regional powers).\n\nThose drivers don\u2019t look like they\u2019re going away.\n\n### What\u2019s less certain\n\nWhat *is* uncertain is the **equilibrium level** of fragmentation:\n\n- One extreme: **full bloc-isation** \u2013 hard techno-economic blocs (US-led vs China-centric, perhaps others) with restricted trade, duplicated tech stacks and finance.  \n- The other: **messy partial fragmentation** \u2013 lots of frictions in strategic sectors (chips, defence, AI, 5G, green tech), but continued deep trade in \u201cnon-strategic\u201d stuff (consumer goods, many services, tourism, etc.).\n\nThe latter is more likely, but even \u201cpartial fragmentation\u201d is a lasting headwind compared to the 1990\u20132008 regime of ever-deeper integration.\n\nSo yes: some degree of **reverse-globalisation / fragmentation is almost certainly a core macro theme for the rest of the century**. The band of uncertainty is about intensity, not direction.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Multipolar world order \u2013 the world is not going back to 1991\u20132008\n\n### The old regime\n\nRoughly 1991\u20132008 was characterised by:\n\n- US military and monetary hegemony (uncontested).  \n- Lack of serious peer competitors.  \n- Growing integration of China and ex-Soviet bloc into a broadly Western-designed system (WTO, global value chains, US dollar funding, etc.).\n\nThat era is over. We\u2019re moving into:\n\n- **US still dominant but contested** by China, with India, EU, and others as partial poles.  \n- Greater use of economic statecraft: sanctions, export controls, weaponisation of finance.  \n- More regional security complexes: US\u2013Japan\u2013Korea in Northeast Asia, QUAD/AUKUS variants, China\u2013Russia axis, etc.\n\n### Why this matters economically\n\nA multipolar, contested order:\n\n- Increases **risk premia** (more geopolitical tails).  \n- Encourages **redundant capacity** (duplicate supply chains, localised production, regional payment systems), which is resilience-enhancing but efficiency-reducing.  \n- Creates **policy unpredictability** (sanctions, tariffs, sudden regulatory changes) that discourages long-horizon cross-border investment.\n\nCould it stabilise into a \u201cmanaged multipolarity\u201d that markets can price and live with? Possibly. But the days when geopolitical risk was a marginal factor in global macro models are gone.\n\nSo again: yes, the **structure of the international system itself becomes a persistent macro variable** rather than background noise.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Will these headwinds \u201ctake center stage\u201d relative to other forces?\n\nI\u2019d phrase it like this:\n\n- **Demographics, fragmentation, and multipolarity** are now the *baseline structural drag* for the century:  \n  - They shape potential output, risk premia, and fiscal space in a slow, relentless way.  \n  - They were mild or positive tailwinds in 1980\u20132005; they are now drags for much of the developed and China-centric world.\n\n- **Technology (AI, biotech, materials, energy)** and **institutional adaptation** are the only realistic large-scale counterweights:  \n  - If AI and related technologies genuinely deliver large TFP gains, they can *offset* some or all of the demographic and fragmentation drag.  \n  - If they underdeliver and we stay in a low-innovation, politically fractious regime, then yes \u2013 your trio of headwinds essentially *defines* the macro environment.\n\nSo your assessment is directionally right: these headwinds *are* long-term and will be central. Where I\u2019d sharpen it is:\n\n1. **They\u2019re structural constraints, not destiny.**  \n   Think of them as the new \u201cgravity\u201d of the system: they lower the baseline growth path and raise background risk. They don\u2019t fully determine outcomes because technology and policy can move the frontier up or down.\n\n2. **Regional asymmetry matters.**  \n   - Demographic drag and the end of hyper-globalisation bite hardest in **Europe, East Asia (incl. China, Korea, Japan), and to a lesser extent the US**.  \n   - **India, parts of ASEAN, and Africa** can still have strong absolute growth because they\u2019re catching up from lower income levels and still have rising working-age populations \u2013 but they\u2019re doing it in a harsher external environment (less trade tailwind, more expensive capital, more geopolitical risk).\n\n3. **We\u2019re in a regime shift, not a brief cycle.**  \n   None of these are likely to normalise in a 5\u201310 year horizon. They\u2019re 30\u201370 year phenomena. That\u2019s the sense in which they will \u201ctake center stage.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5. How I\u2019d summarise your thesis, with caveats\n\nA refined version of your statement could be:\n\n> Over the 21st century, the default forces acting on the global economy are **ageing populations in the rich world and China**, **less benign globalisation** (more fragmentation and duplication), and a **persistently contested, multipolar security order**. These are long-term headwinds that lower the baseline growth path and raise background risk. The only plausible large-scale offsets are sustained technological and organisational breakthroughs (AI, energy, biotech) and effective institutional adaptation.\n\nThat\u2019s a fair, defensible macro framing.\n\nThe key open question \u2013 and where the real action is \u2013 is **how strong the countervailing forces are**:\n\n- If AI/automation + energy innovation hit hard and we manage the politics, you get a \u201clow-friction, high-tech\u201d world where these headwinds are felt but largely neutralised.  \n- If they disappoint and politics deteriorates, then yes, your trio essentially defines a **long era of slower growth, higher risk and more frequent regional shocks**.\n\nSo: you\u2019re right to treat them as central, but any serious forecast has to be \u201cdemographics + fragmentation + multipolarity **versus** technology + institutions,\u201d not just one side of the ledger."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn1news42\ue201","start_idx":1399,"end_idx":1429,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search7\ue202turn4search11\ue201","start_idx":2835,"end_idx":2894,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"90a43296-383f-41e3-8712-59e5b3fb94b0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"7355a8c5-6241-48aa-bdbc-bd40be5008f5","turn_exchange_id":"271ef0e1-3848-4417-9b17-3bd405ad3ffe"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"7355a8c5-6241-48aa-bdbc-bd40be5008f5","children":[]}}}
