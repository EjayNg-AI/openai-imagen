even if you're an individual user and do **not distribute** downloaded content, accessing or downloading copyrighted material from LibGen without authorization typically remains **illegal**.\n\nHere's why precisely:\n\n1. **Copyright infringement**:\n   - Downloading or accessing copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's permission generally constitutes infringement, regardless of whether you're sharing or distributing them.\n   - Copyright laws typically cover not just distribution, but also unauthorized copying, downloading, or possessing such content.\n\n2. **Legal Risks**:\n   - While legal action against individual downloaders is relatively uncommon compared to action against platforms, it's **not impossible**. Individual users can face fines or legal repercussions.\n   - Enforcement varies by jurisdiction, with some countries stricter than others.\n\n3. **Ethical and Legal Alternatives**:\n   - Consider accessing content through legitimate sources such as libraries, institutional databases, open-access repositories, or purchasing from authorized vendors.\n\n**Practical reality**:\n- Although individual prosecution is rare, the action is nonetheless technically illegal in most jurisdictions. Users often underestimate the potential for legal trouble, believing enforcement primarily targets large-scale distributors or platforms\u2014but individual risks still exist.\n\nThus, even purely personal, non-distribution usage doesn't exempt you legally; it's safest to opt for legitimate means of accessing content."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"998f5785-1e62-407f-b50c-31d20744c3d2","request_id":"92af62dc09723d9e-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"998f5785-1e62-407f-b50c-31d20744c3d2","children":[]}}}
