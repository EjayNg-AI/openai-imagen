Differentiation lowers regularity by 1, placing \\(W\\) in \\(H^{\\alpha}\\) for \\(\\alpha<-\\tfrac12\\); that is, \\(W\\) is \u201crougher\u2019\u2019 than any locally integrable function. |\n| **Uniqueness of the derivative** | In distribution theory the weak derivative, if it exists, is unique; thus white noise is *the* derivative of \\(B\\) in this framework. |\n| **SDE notation \\(dB_t\\)** | In stochastic calculus the heuristic \u201c\\(dB_t\\)\u201d is rigorously implemented via It\u00f4 integrals; formally writing \\(dB_t = W_t\\,dt\\) matches the distributional identity \\(B' = W\\) but must still be handled with It\u00f4/Stratonovich rules when integrating against random integrands. |\n\n---\n\n## 6  Conclusion  \nThe assertion  \n\n> \u201cBrownian motion is not differentiable, but if you weaken \u2018derivative\u2019 to mean a distributional one, you get that the derivative of Brownian motion is white noise.\u201d\n\nis **mathematically sound** once the correct functional-analytic framework is stated.  Brownian motion lacks a pointwise or \\(L^2\\) derivative, but when viewed as a random tempered distribution its distributional derivative exists and is precisely Gaussian white noise.  This identification underlies the formal writing \\(dB_t = \\xi(t)\\,dt\\) in SDEs and the modern theory of stochastic (partial) differential equations."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":1015,"end_idx":1034,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Stochastic differential equation - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1104850840.0,"snippet":"SDEs have a random differential that is in the most basic case random white noise calculated as the distributional derivative of a Brownian motion or more ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":2250,"end_idx":2269,"safe_urls":["https://www.math.lsu.edu/grad/kuo?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([math.lsu.edu](https://www.math.lsu.edu/grad/kuo?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Brief Introduction to White Noise Analysis - Math@LSU","url":"https://www.math.lsu.edu/grad/kuo?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"White noise can be thought of as the derivative of a Brownian motion.
