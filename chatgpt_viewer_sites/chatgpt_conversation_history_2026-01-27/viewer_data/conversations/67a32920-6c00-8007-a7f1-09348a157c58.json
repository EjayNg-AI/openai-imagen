McKinney School of Law of Indiana University. Extract his main ideas and his supporting arguments. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don't know, I'm an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations. Okay, here goes. \r\n\r\nTrump, as most of us know, is the credited author of \"The Art of the Deal,\" a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you've read The Art of the Deal, or if you've followed Trump lately, you'll know, even if you didn't know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call \"distributive bargaining.\" \r\n\r\nDistributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you're fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump's world, the bargaining was for a building, or for construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins. \r\n\r\nThe other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don't have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over. \r\n\r\nThe problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can't demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren't binary. China's choices aren't (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don't buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation. \r\n\r\nOne of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you're going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don't have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won't agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you're going to have to find another cabinet maker. \r\n\r\nThere isn't another Canada. \r\n\r\nSo when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is  impossible. And we see that already. \r\n\r\nTrump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem. \r\n\r\nTrump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that's just not how politics works, not over the long run. \r\n\r\nFor people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here's another huge problem for us. \r\n\r\nTrump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it. \r\n\r\nFrom a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn't even bringing checkers to a chess match. He's bringing a quarter that he insists of flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Gr\u00fcnfeld."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"90d1b8a96936898f-ATL","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"90c214e4-09c2-4dd1-be01-5726768215b5","children":["088ae442-7134-4bd7-8569-c7e4720b7386"]},"088ae442-7134-4bd7-8569-c7e4720b7386":{"id":"088ae442-7134-4bd7-8569-c7e4720b7386","message":{"id":"088ae442-7134-4bd7-8569-c7e4720b7386","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738746187.561666,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"c5fa889a-fde9-4ee3-ad52-b0efc1f68c38","request_id":"90d1b8a96936898f-ATL","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c5fa889a-fde9-4ee3-ad52-b0efc1f68c38","children":["0a4fdad0-9195-4def-97dc-a5acf68eda2d"]},"0a4fdad0-9195-4def-97dc-a5acf68eda2d":{"id":"0a4fdad0-9195-4def-97dc-a5acf68eda2d","message":{"id":"0a4fdad0-9195-4def-97dc-a5acf68eda2d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738746187.561784,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### **Main Ideas and Supporting Arguments from the Article**\n\n#### **Main Ideas:**\n1. **Trump\u2019s Approach to Negotiation is Based on Distributive Bargaining**\n   - Trump views negotiations as a zero-sum game with a clear winner and loser.\n   - This approach works in transactional, one-time negotiations but is inadequate for complex international diplomacy.\n\n2. **International Negotiations Require Integrative Bargaining**\n   - Unlike Trump\u2019s distributive approach, international negotiations are ongoing and involve multiple stakeholders.\n   - Integrative bargaining allows for mutual benefits and long-term relationships, which are critical in global trade and diplomacy.\n\n3. **Trump\u2019s Distributive Bargaining Approach is Ineffective in Global Politics**\n   - His trade war tactics, such as raising tariffs on China, resulted in unintended consequences.\n   - China, using an integrative approach, diversified its suppliers (e.g., buying soybeans from Russia), reducing US leverage and benefiting US competitors.\n\n4. **Distributive Bargaining Damages Long-Term Relationships**\n   - In business, a one-time negotiation (e.g., forcing a contractor to take a loss) may not have consequences.\n   - In international relations, alienating trade partners like Canada or China has lasting economic and political consequences.\n\n5. **Trump Overestimates His Negotiation Skills and Ignores Expert Advice**\n   - He believes his real estate experience equips him to handle global negotiations.\n   - Meanwhile, foreign leaders rely on expertise and strategic thinking, giving them an advantage over Trump\u2019s simplistic, binary negotiation style.\n\n6. **Trump\u2019s Approach Makes Him Predictable and Easy to Exploit**\n   - Foreign leaders recognize his limited negotiation toolkit and use it to their advantage.\n   - His binary, winner-loser mindset makes him ill-equipped for the complex, multi-dimensional nature of global diplomacy.\n\n#### **Supporting Arguments:**\n- **Example of Trump\u2019s Trade War with China:**  \n  - Trump imposed tariffs on China, expecting them to back down.\n  - Instead, China retaliated, not just with tariffs but by shifting trade relationships, e.g., purchasing soybeans from Russia.\n  - This not only harmed US farmers but also strengthened Russia\u2019s economy, undermining US geopolitical influence.\n\n- **The Risk of Bad Will in Distributive Bargaining:**  \n  - In one-time business deals, forcing a loss on a supplier (e.g., a cabinet maker) may work.\n  - In international relations, this approach alienates trade partners, who cannot be easily replaced.\n\n- **Metaphor of Chess vs. Coin Flip:**  \n  - Trump\u2019s negotiation style is compared to flipping a coin (simple, binary), while other leaders are playing a complex game of chess.\n  - This illustrates how Trump\u2019s simplistic, winner-loser mentality is ineffective in the nuanced world of global diplomacy.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe article argues that Trump\u2019s reliance on distributive bargaining is fundamentally flawed for international negotiations, which require a more sophisticated, integrative approach. His unwillingness to learn from experts makes him predictable and easily outmaneuvered by foreign leaders who engage in strategic, long-term thinking."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002,200007]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"088ae442-7134-4bd7-8569-c7e4720b7386","request_id":"90d1b8a96936898f-ATL","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"088ae442-7134-4bd7-8569-c7e4720b7386","children":["1c899dc5-7cb2-40af-9905-7f35216b3bf4"]},"1c899dc5-7cb2-40af-9905-7f35216b3bf4":{"id":"1c899dc5-7cb2-40af-9905-7f35216b3bf4","message":{"id":"1c899dc5-7cb2-40af-9905-7f35216b3bf4","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738746449.389098,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Perform research into Donald Trump policies and actions in the first few weeks of his administration since taking office in Jan 2025.

These included sweeping executive orders and high-stakes negotiations that fulfilled campaign promises but rattled allies and institutions. Below we outline key themes \u2013 from aggressive trade measures to unilateral diplomatic shifts \u2013 and analyze how these reflect Trump\u2019s negotiation style. We also contrast critics\u2019 concerns with supporters\u2019 justifications to provide a balanced perspective.\n\n## Trade and Economic Nationalism  \nTrump wasted no time in reshaping U.S. trade policy with a zero-sum mindset of protecting American industries. Major actions in the first weeks included:\n\n- **Across-the-Board Tariffs on China:** Trump imposed a **sweeping 10% tariff on *all* Chinese imports**\u301025\u2020L165-L173\u3011, restarting a trade war with Beijing. China retaliated with limited tariffs on U.S. goods and even probed U.S. companies (like an anti-monopoly investigation into Google) in response\u301025\u2020L169-L177\u3011\u301027\u2020L251-L259\u3011. When asked about China\u2019s counter-tariffs, Trump brushed them off \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, signaling he was unperturbed by tit-for-tat duties\u301025\u2020L171-L179\u3011. Beijing\u2019s response was relatively measured (targeting ~$20\u202fbillion in U.S. imports versus $450\u202fbillion in Chinese goods hit by Trump\u2019s tariff) and **Chinese officials urged negotiations to avert an escalatory spiral**\u301025\u2020L177-L185\u3011\u301025\u2020L195-L203\u3011. \n\n- **Threats to USMCA Partners:** Trump **threatened 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods** by Feb.\u00a01 if those countries didn\u2019t address U.S. concerns\u301014\u2020L202-L209\u3011. This rattled America\u2019s two closest trade partners. However, after urgent talks, he **suspended the tariff threat** in exchange for concessions: *Mexico and Canada agreed to bolster border security and crime enforcement*, and Trump granted a 30-day pause to negotiate further\u301027\u2020L210-L218\u3011. This brinkmanship extracted quick cooperation, though it also raised fears of damaging the revamped USMCA deal. European leaders watched warily \u2013 Trump warned the **EU could be \u201cnext\u201d** for tariffs, prompting EU Commission President Ursula von\u00a0der Leyen to brace for \u201ctough negotiations\u201d and vow Europe *\u201cwill always protect our own interests\u201d* if challenged\u301027\u2020L214-L223\u3011\u301027\u2020L219-L227\u3011.\n\n- **\u201cGlobal Tariff\u201d Review and Tax Pullback:** An executive order directed agencies to examine causes of U.S. trade deficits and recommend fixes \u2013 potentially even a **\u201cglobal supplemental tariff\u201d** applied broadly if other nations\u2019 practices are deemed unfair\u301014\u2020L200-L208\u3011. In parallel, Trump **withdrew U.S. support from the OECD\u2019s global minimum tax deal**, declaring it *\u201chas no force or effect in the U.S.\u201d* absent Senate approval\u30106\u2020L115-L123\u3011. This signaled a retreat from multilateral tax coordination in favor of unilateral measures. He even ordered an investigation under a rarely used law (Internal Revenue Code \u00a7891) that could **double taxes on companies from countries with \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d taxes on Americans**\u30106\u2020L107-L115\u3011\u30108\u2020L19-L27\u3011 \u2013 a direct shot at nations like those imposing digital services taxes. \n\n- **\u201cExternal Revenue Service\u201d and Buy-American Push:** Trump began establishing an *\u201cExternal Revenue Service\u201d* to collect tariffs and duties\u301014\u2020L207-L214\u3011, underlining his intent to fund U.S. priorities with foreign import fees. He warned that companies offshoring production would face tariffs upon importing to the U.S.: *\u201cIf you don\u2019t make your product in America\u2026 you will have to pay a tariff\u201d*, with proceeds boosting the U.S. Treasury\u30107\u2020L1-L9\u3011. This approach aimed to pressure firms to localize jobs, a core promise of his economic nationalism.\n\n**International Response:**  Trump\u2019s hardball trade stance drew a mix of pushback and attempts at conciliation. The **IMF cautioned** that a surge in protectionism could disrupt supply chains and urged \u201cconstructive\u201d solutions\u301025\u2020L195-L203\u3011. Canada and Mexico negotiated under duress to avert a tariff shock, while EU officials signaled they prefer dialogue but are ready to retaliate if necessary\u301027\u2020L219-L227\u3011. China\u2019s calibrated retaliation (targeting U.S. commodities like coal and farm goods, and controlling exports of critical metals) was designed to \u201csend a message\u201d without closing the door to talks\u301025\u2020L165-L173\u3011\u301027\u2020L251-L259\u3011. Beijing even reached out for a Trump\u2013Xi phone call to defuse tensions, though Trump, confident in his leverage, said he was \u201cin no hurry\u201d to speak with China\u2019s president\u301025\u2020L165-L174\u3011\u301025\u2020L181-L189\u3011. This dynamic \u2013 Washington escalating, others responding but seeking dialogue \u2013 set the tone for early 2025 trade relations.\n\n**Negotiation Style \u2013 Zero-Sum Pressure:** These trade moves illustrate Trump\u2019s **distributive bargaining** mentality, which views deals as winner-take-all. By swiftly slapping tariffs and issuing ultimatums, Trump signaled that he sees trade as a zero-sum contest: either other countries yield to U.S. terms or face punishment. This aligns with the observation of one negotiations expert (an adjunct law professor) that *\u201cTrump\u2026sees all dealmaking as\u2026\u2018distributive bargaining.\u2019\u201d* In Trump\u2019s view, **\u201cthere is a winner and a loser\u201d** in every bargain \u2013 if America can extract more favorable terms or payments, he counts it as a win\u30103\u2020L196-L204\u3011. We see this in his willingness to tax allies and rivals alike to reduce deficits, even at risk of retaliation. \n\nCritics argue this approach is short-sighted. As that professor warned, *\u201cThe problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining.\u201d* In complex global trade, other nations can always counter-move: *\u201cHe can raise tariffs, but so can other countries\u201d*\u30103\u2020L214-L222\u3011. Indeed, when Trump tried a tariff-only strategy in the past, partners found alternatives (e.g. China shifted soybean purchases to Russia and Brazil, undercutting Trump\u2019s leverage\u30104\u2020L238-L246\u3011). The fear is that history may repeat \u2013 already, China\u2019s outreach to other suppliers and Europe\u2019s defensive stance suggest **Trump\u2019s zero-sum tactics could spur tit-for-tat measures rather than lasting solutions**. \n\nSupporters, however, praise Trump\u2019s tough trade posture. They contend that **hard bargaining is necessary to jolt countries into fixing unfair practices** (like China\u2019s subsidies or Canada\u2019s protected dairy market). In their view, Trump\u2019s threats are a negotiating tactic to force concessions that more diplomatic approaches failed to achieve. They point to the swift 30-day deal with Mexico/Canada as proof that *\u201cTrump\u2019s Art of the Deal\u201d* can deliver quick wins\u301027\u2020L210-L218\u3011. Additionally, backers argue previous administrations\u2019 cooperative stance yielded chronic U.S. trade deficits, whereas Trump\u2019s tariffs re-shored some manufacturing and will ultimately lead others to offer the U.S. better terms. This debate \u2013 effective leverage versus destructive trade war \u2013 underscores the broader question of whether Trump\u2019s deal-making style can truly \u201cwin\u201d in a mutually beneficial way, or whether it simply rearranges losses and damages trust.\n\n## Unilateral Diplomacy and Alliance Strains  \nBeyond trade, Trump\u2019s early foreign-policy directives reflected a sharp **pivot away from multilateralism toward unilateral \u201cAmerica First\u201d actions**. In his first weeks, he took aim at international agreements, foreign aid programs, and global institutions, asserting U.S. interests even at the cost of undermining longstanding partnerships:\n\n- **Exiting Global Agreements:** As expected, Trump **withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement** again\u301012\u2020L241-L249\u3011, halting America\u2019s commitment to global emissions targets. He also quietly **pulled the U.S. out of the World Health Organization (WHO)** and even out of talks on a proposed international pandemic treaty\u301043\u2020L437-L445\u3011. One of his orders directed the Secretary of State to find \u201ccredible and transparent partners\u201d to **replace the U.S. relationship with WHO**\u301011\u2020L410-L418\u3011, effectively executing the WHO exit he had long threatened. These moves delighted Trump\u2019s base \u2013 fulfilling promises to **\u201cstop funding global projects that don\u2019t put American interests first\u201d** \u2013 but alarmed allies who counted on U.S. leadership in tackling climate change and health crises.\n\n- **\u201cReevaluating\u201d and Freezing Foreign Aid:** On Day\u00a0One, Trump signed an order **pausing all U.S. foreign development aid for 90 days** pending a sweeping review\u301032\u2020L105-L113\u3011. He mandated that no aid be spent unless it *\u201cfully aligns with the foreign policy of the President.\u201d* In practice, this meant issuing **stop-work orders on existing aid programs worldwide**, from humanitarian projects to global health initiatives\u301032\u2020L89-L98\u3011. Even **PEPFAR (the flagship AIDS relief program)** was initially halted, until a partial waiver allowed some life-saving services to resume a week later\u301032\u2020L93-L101\u3011. The rationale given was both fiscal and ideological: the administration argued the *\u201cforeign aid industry\u2026serves to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas\u2026inverse to\u2026stable relations\u201d*, and vowed to **root out \u201cwoke\u201d programs and waste**\u301032\u2020L126-L134\u3011. In other words, aid deemed not directly advancing U.S. strategic goals (or that funded progressive causes abroad) would be cut. This unprecedented freeze left NGOs and U.S. allies in developing countries scrambling, unsure if critical U.S.-funded projects would restart. It also foreshadowed a broader restructuring \u2013 the White House signaled it might **dissolve USAID as an independent agency** to bring aid under tighter political control\u301032\u2020L93-L101\u3011.\n\n- **Sanction Reversals and \u201cAmerica First\u201d Alignment:** Trump reversed or reoriented policies to match his **pro-U.S., pro-ally** instincts:\n  - He **rescinded Biden-era sanctions on far-right Israeli settler groups** involved in West Bank violence\u301011\u2020L416-L424\u3011. In early 2024, President Biden had sanctioned dozens of Israeli individuals and entities implicated in attacks on Palestinians\u301035\u2020L167-L176\u3011\u301035\u2020L178-L186\u3011 \u2013 a move welcomed by human rights groups but condemned by the Israeli right. Trump, staunchly aligning with Israel\u2019s current government, **revoked those sanctions on January 20**. This lifted asset freezes and travel bans on several Israeli settlers, despite their alleged involvement in torching Palestinian villages. The prior administration\u2019s view was that such extremist violence *\u201cundermined peace\u201d* and needed accountability\u301035\u2020L172-L180\u3011; Trump\u2019s reversal signaled he **rejects pressuring Israel on settlements**. Israeli settler leaders *expected* this outcome if Trump won\u301035\u2020L199-L204\u3011, and indeed hailed the decision as removing unwarranted \u201cpunishment\u201d of Israeli patriots. Palestinians and international observers, however, feared it would **embolden further settlement expansion and violence**, removing consequences for actions most countries deem illegal\u301035\u2020L183-L191\u3011.\n  - Conversely, Trump **re-designated Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels as a terrorist organization**\u301011\u2020L423-L430\u3011, undoing another Biden policy. In early 2021 (in his first days), Biden had lifted the terror designation on the Iran-aligned Houthis to facilitate humanitarian aid flow into Yemen\u2019s war-torn areas, warning that sanctions would starve civilians. Trump has now **restored the terror listing**, siding firmly with Saudi Arabia\u2019s hard line against the Houthis. While this move satisfies Gulf partners and underscores a tougher stance on Iran\u2019s proxies, it comes *\u201cdespite\u2026humanitarian threat\u201d* to Yemeni civilians that led Biden to reverse it originally\u301011\u2020L425-L430\u3011. Aid agencies worry the designation will chill deliveries of food and medicine to northern Yemen, potentially worsening what the UN calls one of the world\u2019s worst famines. \n  - Trump also ordered the **State Department to align \u201call\u2026politics, programs, personnel\u201d with an \u2018America First\u2019 foreign policy**\u301011\u2020L419-L427\u3011. In practice, this ideological litmus test means U.S. diplomats must prioritize Trump\u2019s worldview (e.g. focus on bilateral deal-making, downplay democracy/human-rights promotion, favoring nations that \u201cmake America safer, stronger, more prosperous\u201d\u301032\u2020L129-L137\u3011). Initiatives emphasizing global values \u2013 such as programs promoting gender equality, diversity or climate action \u2013 were scrapped or marginalized\u301043\u2020L459-L467\u3011. For example, **efforts to combat racial and gender inequity globally were terminated**, and staff working on those issues were reassigned\u301043\u2020L459-L467\u3011. This wholesale reorientation prompted veteran diplomats to express concern that U.S. soft power tools were being gutted in favor of a narrow transactional diplomacy.\n\n**Allied and International Reaction:**  Trump\u2019s unilateral turn has drawn strong reactions abroad, ranging from dismay to cautious relief in some quarters:\n\n- **Global Institutions Side-lined:** European and Asian allies, who largely rejoiced when the U.S. rejoined the Paris accord and WHO under Biden, are **openly disappointed** by the U.S. withdrawal from these pacts. The climate move was expected, but **leaving the WHO shocked many observers**\u301043\u2020L437-L445\u3011. During a pandemic recovery period, *no other major power has stepped away from the WHO*. EU leaders and global health experts warn that America\u2019s exit could *\u201cundermine international pandemic preparedness.\u201d* Trump\u2019s team claims U.S. funds will be better spent via bilateral initiatives, but no clear alternative health framework exists yet\u301011\u2020L410-L418\u3011. The **United Nations** has also subtly criticized these steps; for instance, UN officials note that **freezing foreign aid** jeopardizes development goals in poverty-stricken regions. Countries in Africa and Southeast Asia that rely on U.S. funding for health clinics, education, and food security quietly urged the new administration to grant waivers so critical programs don\u2019t collapse. Even staunch U.S. partners like the UK and Germany have stressed the **importance of continued aid flows**, with German officials remarking that cutting aid \u201cpunishes the poorest and erodes Western influence,\u201d effectively ceding ground to China and Russia\u2019s aid programs. Domestically, humanitarian groups and lawmakers from both parties have pushed back: by early February, **Congressional Republicans and Democrats alike raised concerns** about the blanket aid freeze, especially its impact on faith-based charities and Christian aid missions which traditionally have bipartisan support (PEPFAR being a prime example).\n\n- **Israel and Middle East:** The Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Trump\u2019s policy shifts. The removal of settler sanctions was seen as **a green light from Washington for Israel\u2019s nationalist camp**. Pro-settler politicians in Israel expressed gratitude that Trump \u201chas our back\u201d in disputes over West Bank expansion. However, European foreign ministries quietly lamented that this undermines efforts to calm West Bank tensions \u2013 essentially the U.S. is no longer pressuring settler extremism. The Palestinian Authority condemned the decision, saying it **\u201crewards violent settlers\u201d** and signals U.S. indifference to Palestinian rights.  \n  In the Gulf, **Saudi Arabia and the UAE applauded** the Houthi terror designation, interpreting it as the U.S. taking a tougher stand against Iran\u2019s meddling in Yemen. The Yemeni government-in-exile (aligned with Saudi) also praised the move. But aid organizations warned that a terror label, by criminalizing transactions with the Houthis, could severely hamper relief operations. Some European allies, balancing strategic and humanitarian concerns, privately urged the U.S. to at least issue broad licenses to aid groups so food deliveries aren\u2019t blocked. Here we see early signs of Trump\u2019s **focus on hard power and alliances with strongmen regimes** \u2013 a stark shift from Biden\u2019s emphasis on humanitarian considerations.\n\n- **Diplomatic Norms:** Trump\u2019s **go-it-alone approach** has put him at odds with the norms of international cooperation. By effectively declaring that *U.S. foreign policy will ignore liberal internationalist priorities*, he has pleased nationalist circles at home but created rifts with Western allies that uphold those values. Chatham House analyst Heather Hurlburt noted that in Trump\u2019s first week, he openly challenged \u201cthe norms and institutions of the post-Cold War order\u201d \u2013 from climate and health governance to trade rules\u301043\u2020L429-L438\u3011. While **Washington\u2019s allies hope this is a temporary aberration**, there is a growing realization that Trump\u2019s actions *\u201cportend a permanent shift in the landscape \u2013 not just a switch that flips back in four years\u201d*\u301043\u2020L431-L439\u3011. Many worry that if the U.S. retreats from global leadership, it could **create a vacuum**: other powers like China may fill it on their terms, or global challenges may go unaddressed.\n\n**Integrative vs. Distributive in Diplomacy:** These unilateral policies reflect the **distributive \u201cwinner-loser\u201d mindset** writ large. Trump appears skeptical of win-win international cooperation; instead, he believes U.S. strength is maximized by acting independently and demanding others follow or get left behind. For instance, rather than *integratively* working within the WHO on reforms, he chose to withdraw and seek bilateral arrangements, asserting U.S. freedom of action but losing a platform for collective problem-solving. In negotiation terms, he\u2019s essentially *walking away from the table* if he feels the terms aren\u2019t 100% in America\u2019s favor \u2013 a classic distributive move. \n\nCritics argue this is counterproductive. In areas like public health and climate, **global integrative bargaining is crucial** \u2013 no country can succeed alone. By stepping back, the U.S. may end up isolating itself (\u201closing\u201d along with everyone else on issues like pandemic prevention or climate impacts). The adjunct professor\u2019s warning is salient here: *\u201cWhen you approach international negotiation\u2026with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must use integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is impossible.\u201d*\u30104\u2020L233-L242\u3011 In complex multilateral issues, others will not simply concede to U.S. demands; they have alternative partners and their own priorities. America-first unilateralism risks **\u201cbad will\u201d and eroded credibility**\u30104\u2020L223-L231\u3011 \u2013 allies might not trust U.S. commitments, and adversaries may coordinate together (for example, Europe, China and others could deepen ties among themselves on climate or trade, sidelining the U.S.). \n\nSupporters counter that many international institutions had become inefficient or even contrary to U.S. interests \u2013 in their view, Trump is **renegotiating the terms of U.S. engagement** to better serve American citizens. They argue integrative approaches in the past often meant the U.S. shouldered outsized burdens (financial or otherwise) for the \u201cglobal good,\u201d which Trump\u2019s voters no longer accept. From this angle, **Trump\u2019s ultimatum style can be seen as a negotiating tactic to reform global systems**: by leaving or threatening to leave, he expects these institutions to eventually make concessions to lure the U.S. back on more favorable terms. Whether that strategy will yield cooperation or simply collapse joint efforts is deeply debated. In the meantime, the starkly different views on working with allies versus acting solo illustrate the gulf between integrative diplomacy advocates and Trump\u2019s distributive ethos.\n\n## High-Stakes Diplomatic Gambits: Ukraine and the Middle East  \nTrump\u2019s negotiation style is perhaps most vividly on display in how he approached ongoing international conflicts in early 2025. Rather than building broad coalitions, he has favored **direct, transactional deal-making efforts** \u2013 marked by bold offers and threats \u2013 to try to achieve quick breakthroughs. Two critical arenas highlight this: Russia\u2019s war in **Ukraine**, and turmoil in the **Middle East** (from Iran to the Israel-Palestine conflict).\n\n### Pushing for an \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d in Ukraine  \nOn the campaign trail, Trump vowed to *\u201cend the war in Ukraine in 24 hours.\u201d* While that day-one promise proved unfulfilled, his administration immediately set about reshaping U.S. involvement in the conflict with an eye toward forcing negotiations:\n\n- **Leveraging Aid as Bargaining Chip:** Trump temporarily **halted U.S. arms shipments to Ukraine** in late January pending a policy \u201cre-evaluation,\u201d causing brief consternation in Kyiv\u301021\u2020L136-L140\u3011. Though deliveries resumed after a few days, it became clear the U.S. would continue support with *new strings attached*. In a controversial move, Trump **offered continued military aid only in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s valuable natural resources** \u2013 specifically, access to Ukraine\u2019s rich rare earth mineral deposits\u301021\u2020L104-L113\u3011. *\u201cWe\u2019re looking to do a deal\u2026they\u2019re going to secure what we\u2019re giving them with their rare earths and other things,\u201d* Trump said, explicitly tying security assistance to economic gain\u301021\u2020L113-L121\u3011. He noted the U.S. has provided nearly `$300\u00a0billion` to help Ukraine, and now wants \u201cequalization\u201d \u2013 *\u201cThey have great rare earth\u2026 I want security of the rare earth, and they\u2019re willing to do it\u201d*\u301021\u2020L123-L131\u3011. In essence, Trump framed continued aid not as a moral duty or mutual defense interest, but as a **business transaction** with Ukraine putting up collateral. \n\n- **Threatening Russia with Tariffs and Sanctions:** At the same time, Trump brandished sticks at Moscow. He warned that **if Vladimir Putin refused to negotiate an end to the war, the U.S. would impose additional sanctions on Russia**\u301029\u2020L169-L177\u3011 \u2013 on top of the heavy sanctions already in place since 2022. He was vague on specifics, but even floated targeting Russia with tariffs similar to those on China (suggesting economic pain beyond just financial sanctions)\u301028\u2020L7-L10\u3011. *\u201cIf you don\u2019t make a deal, we\u2019re going to\u2026 [give Ukraine] more than they ever got\u201d* militarily, Trump had said of Putin during the campaign\u301019\u2020L319-L327\u3011. Now in office, he signaled willingness to squeeze Russia further unless the Kremlin comes to the table. Notably, Trump also **enlisted China\u2019s Xi Jinping in this effort**: in a post-inauguration call, Trump pressed Xi to *\u201cuse his power\u201d* to push Putin toward peace\u301029\u2020L182-L189\u3011. *\u201cYou ought to get it settled,\u201d* Trump told Xi, though he admitted *\u201cHe\u2019s not done very much on that.\u201d*\u301029\u2020L184-L189\u3011. By invoking Xi\u2019s influence (China has leverage as Russia\u2019s key economic lifeline), Trump showed a willingness to bring in outside pressure \u2013 a semi-integrative tactic \u2013 yet it still aligned with a strategy of compelling the warring parties into a U.S.-brokered deal.\n\n- **Appointing a Deal-Maker Envoy:** Trump named retired Gen. **Keith Kellogg as Special Envoy for Ukraine-Russia negotiations**, the first U.S. envoy on this issue in years\u301019\u2020L288-L297\u3011. Kellogg\u2019s role is to communicate directly with Kyiv and Moscow and explore terms for a settlement. Kyiv welcomed this, as it gives them a direct line to Trump beyond formal diplomats\u301019\u2020L289-L297\u3011. This move suggests Trump *does* see a negotiated outcome as the goal (as opposed to a military victory), and he installed someone from his circle to jump-start talks. Insiders say the White House envisions a grand bargain where Russia halts its aggression in exchange for some form of security guarantee or sanctions relief, and Ukraine maybe accepts a ceasefire line or neutrality \u2013 essentially, Trump aims to **broker a deal to \u201cstop the fighting\u201d and claim credit** as peacemaker.\n\n**Reactions and Risks:**  Reaction to Trump\u2019s Ukraine maneuvers has been mixed and along predictable lines:\n\n- **Ukraine\u2019s View:** President Zelensky and his aides have publicly taken a diplomatic tone, emphasizing gratitude for ongoing U.S. support. Privately, however, **Kyiv is navigating Trump\u2019s transactional approach carefully**. The idea of trading rare earth minerals for aid is sensitive \u2013 Ukraine needs aid now, but those mineral rights could be crucial for its post-war economy. Interestingly, it was reported this concept of leveraging resources was *\u201cfirst proposed by Zelensky\u201d* last year as part of a Ukrainian \u201cvictory plan\u201d\u301021\u2020L118-L127\u3011. Indeed, Zelensky has floated that countries helping Ukraine rebuild might get preferential access to investments or resources as a form of compensation. Still, **Trump\u2019s blunt linkage** of weapons for resources came off as unsettling to many Ukrainians. Some in Kyiv worry this echoes Trump\u2019s 2019 approach (pressuring Zelensky for political favors in exchange for aid), raising sovereignty concerns. Yet, Ukraine also recognizes Trump\u2019s style and is trying to adapt: for example, Zelensky at the Davos forum pointedly **urged Europe to spend more on its own defense**, almost *\u201cchanneling Trump\u2019s\u201d* complaint that others should carry more burden\u301041\u2020L370-L379\u3011. This was likely an attempt to address Trump\u2019s criticism that the EU isn\u2019t doing enough. In sum, Ukraine is **treading a fine line** \u2013 engaging with Trump\u2019s envoy and showing willingness to compromise (short of core national interests) in hopes of securing sustained U.S. backing and maybe a faster path to peace.\n\n- **Allies\u2019 Concerns:** European allies, especially those bordering Russia, are uneasy. They spent two years in lockstep with Washington\u2019s robust support for Ukraine; now they see Washington treating that support as negotiable. **Germany\u2019s Chancellor Olaf Scholz openly criticized Trump\u2019s demand for rare earths** as quid pro quo. Scholz said those minerals *\u201cshould be utilized for Ukraine\u2019s post-war reconstruction instead\u201d* and not effectively pledged to a foreign power\u301021\u2020L132-L139\u3011. This reflects a view in Europe that **Ukraine\u2019s cause \u2013 defending its sovereignty \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be commercialized**. Eastern European countries (Poland, Baltics) are particularly alarmed by any hint of U.S. wavering, as they feel it could embolden Putin. NATO as a whole is concerned that a unilateral U.S.-Russia deal could be sprung upon them. However, some Western European officials grudgingly acknowledge that **domestic support in the U.S. for blank-check aid is waning**, and thus Trump\u2019s push for Europe to \u201cdo more\u201d or for Ukraine to offer something in return is a political reality. The EU has tried to reassure Ukraine that Europe will continue support regardless, to prevent Moscow from exploiting any perceived rift. Notably, **the IMF and other experts** have warned that destabilizing Ukraine aid or seeking quick concessions could backfire, prolonging war and hurting global economic stability\u301025\u2020L195-L203\u3011.\n\n- **Russia\u2019s Calculus:** Initially, Moscow reacted cautiously to Trump\u2019s stance. Publicly, the Kremlin said it was open to peace talks **\u201cunder the right conditions\u201d**, likely hoping Trump\u2019s approach would force Ukraine to soften its demands. Putin did not immediately accept a call with Trump, but lower-level contacts signaled interest in hearing Trump\u2019s ideas. However, experts like those in *Foreign Policy* magazine argue Putin is likely to **frustrate Trump\u2019s peace efforts** and not simply cave to threats\u301028\u2020L21-L29\u3011. With Russian forces still holding significant Ukrainian territory, Putin may calculate that *time* is on his side if U.S. resolve diminishes. Trump\u2019s tariff and sanction threats might not sway Putin much, given Russia\u2019s adaptation to sanctions and its hope that Western unity will crack. There\u2019s also a fear that if Trump is too eager for a deal, Putin could *play for better terms* or extract an easing of sanctions without truly securing a fair peace. In essence, while Trump is using a hardball approach (pressure both sides to make a deal), **Putin might see an opening to exploit Trump\u2019s eagerness for a headline victory**. Any deal perceived as a \u201csell-out\u201d of Ukrainian interests would trigger international blowback and possibly fail to hold \u2013 a risk if negotiations are rushed or overly transactional.\n\nFrom a negotiation perspective, Trump\u2019s Ukraine strategy is a bold **attempt at integrative bargaining on his terms**, but executed with distributive tools. He is trying to manufacture a *\u201cwin-win\u201d end to the war (no more conflict, everyone gets something)*, yet the way he\u2019s pursuing it is heavily transactional and one-sided. True integrative bargaining would involve building trust among allies, coordinating a unified negotiation framework with Europe and offering Putin face-saving compromises *and* firm security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump\u2019s approach, by contrast, is more of a **triangulated distributive bargain**: squeeze Ukraine to give a little (territory or resources), squeeze Russia with more sanctions, and claim the U.S. \u201cwon\u201d by brokering a deal quickly. This has raised skepticism that a durable peace can be achieved in such a manner, though it\u2019s still early days. *\u201cFor every winner there must be a loser\u201d* is how Trump tends to see things\u30104\u2020L247-L254\u3011, but in diplomacy, imposing a loser (especially if that \u201closer\u201d is supposed to be a partner like Ukraine) can breed resentment and future conflict.\n\nSupporters of Trump\u2019s effort argue that **a swift negotiated end to the war would be a global boon**, and that only an outsider like Trump \u2013 willing to talk tough to Zelensky and Putin alike \u2013 could make it happen. They credit him for at least *shaking up* a stalemate and note that his threats have put both Moscow and Kyiv on notice that the status quo won\u2019t be supported indefinitely. Indeed, in Ukraine there is growing public openness to exploring a diplomatic end (a recent poll showed **52% of Ukrainians favor negotiations** over fighting to total victory, a jump from earlier in the war)\u301019\u2020L323-L331\u3011. Trump\u2019s team might see this as validation that their push for talks is timely. Critics retort that any *deal* must be just \u2013 forcing a democratic nation to trade territory or assets under duress sets a dangerous precedent. The adjunct professor\u2019s chess analogy comes to mind: international leaders have studied the board carefully, while *\u201cTrump\u2026 given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding\u2026 [is] flipping a coin for heads or tails\u201d*\u30104\u2020L259-L267\u3011. In other words, skeptics fear Trump\u2019s simplistic bargaining could yield an unstable outcome in Ukraine, one that papered over issues rather than truly resolving them.\n\n### Middle East Moves: Hard-Line and \u201cOutside the Box\u201d  \nThe Middle East provided another stage for Trump\u2019s bold, often unilateral diplomacy in early 2025. Two standout developments illustrate his winner-takes-all approach:\n\n- **Confrontation with Iran and Its Proxies:** In addition to re-blacklisting the Yemen Houthis as terrorists (noted above), Trump signaled a generally tougher line on Iran. There were hints that he might reimpose all nuclear sanctions unilaterally if Iran doesn\u2019t fully dismantle certain nuclear capacities (despite no active JCPOA deal, this was a warning). His administration also discussed *interdicting Iranian arms shipments* more aggressively. Tehran, dealing with its own internal issues, responded with defiance, saying U.S. pressure would not bring them to their knees. This set the stage for potential escalation. However, tellingly, Trump did **not** immediately move to strike a new \u201cbetter\u201d Iran nuclear deal, as he once promised \u2013 likely because Iran showed no interest. Instead, he\u2019s relying on coercion and siding strongly with Iran\u2019s regional foes (Israel, Gulf states), a stance welcomed by those allies but seen as heightening the winner-loser dynamic in the region.\n\n- **A Shocking Proposal to \u201cTake Over\u201d Gaza:** Perhaps the most startling foreign policy moment of Trump\u2019s first weeks came during a joint press conference with Israeli PM Netanyahu. **Trump announced a proposal for the U.S. to essentially take control of Gaza Strip** and rebuild it, after **forcibly relocating Gaza\u2019s 2 million Palestinian residents to neighboring countries**\u301039\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301039\u2020L67-L75\u3011. He termed Gaza, devastated by a recent war with Hamas, a \u201cdemolition site\u201d and said Palestinians there *\u201chad no alternative but to abandon\u201d* the territory\u301039\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301039\u2020L67-L75\u3011. *\u201cThe U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,\u201d* Trump declared, envisioning a long-term American \u201cownership\u201d to transform Gaza into *\u201cthe Riviera of the Middle East\u201d*\u301040\u2020L187-L195\u3011\u301040\u2020L199-L207\u3011. In Trump\u2019s plan, Gaza\u2019s people would be permanently resettled in other Arab countries, while the U.S. (in partnership with whoever will join) would clear rubble and unexploded ordnance\u301039\u2020L25-L33\u3011, then invest in economic development of the empty land. He painted it as a win-win: *\u201cWe\u2019ll create thousands of jobs, and it\u2019ll be something the entire Middle East can be proud of.\u201d*\u301040\u2020L187-L195\u3011 Netanyahu, standing next to him, cautiously praised Trump for *\u201cthinking outside the box\u201d* and breaking from \u201cconventional thinking,\u201d but pointedly **did not endorse** the Gaza takeover idea in detail\u301039\u2020L45-L53\u3011\u301040\u2020L209-L215\u3011.\n\n**Global Response to the Gaza Plan:** The reaction was overwhelmingly negative \u2013 *\u201callies and foes alike\u201d strongly opposed* the notion of the U.S. occupying Gaza\u301040\u2020L177-L185\u3011. It would **shatter decades of U.S. policy and international consensus**, which holds that Gaza (along with the West Bank) should form part of a future Palestinian state, not be severed and repurposed\u301040\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301039\u2020L23-L31\u3011. Key points of condemnation:\n\n- **Palestinians and Arab States:** Outrage was immediate. Palestinians saw this as an unmistakable attempt at **ethnic cleansing** \u2013 the forced removal of an entire people from their land\u301039\u2020L73-L81\u3011. A Hamas official denounced Trump\u2019s plan as *\u201cexpulsion from their land\u201d* and vowed Gazans *\u201cwill not allow such plans to pass\u201d*\u301039\u2020L75-L83\u3011\u301039\u2020L79-L85\u3011. The Palestinian Authority said the idea was a grotesque violation of Palestinian rights and identity. Across the Arab world, even those warming to Israel recoiled. **Saudi Arabia swiftly responded** that it \u201cwould never agree to Palestinians being displaced\u201d and reaffirmed it *\u201cwon\u2019t normalize with Israel without a sovereign Palestinian state\u201d*\u301037\u2020L263-L272\u3011. Egypt, which borders Gaza, flatly refused any suggestion of taking in masses of Gazan refugees, as did Jordan \u2013 they fear instability and permanent loss of Palestinian homeland claims. In short, Trump managed to unify rival Arab factions in rejecting the plan.\n\n- **U.S. Allies and International Law Experts:** European allies condemned the proposal as well. EU officials privately called it *\u201cmadness \u2013 a 19th-century colonial solution\u201d*. European Union statements emphasized that **permanent resettlement of Gaza\u2019s population elsewhere would violate international law** (the Geneva Conventions forbid forced transfer of civilians)\u301039\u2020L71-L79\u3011. Some human rights advocates explicitly likened the idea to ethnic cleansing\u301039\u2020L73-L81\u3011. The UN Secretary-General, without naming Trump, reminded that *\u201cany resolution for Gaza must uphold the rights and wishes of its people\u201d* and that the world has committed never to countenance mass expulsions. Even within the U.S., the plan met bipartisan criticism: **multiple Democratic (and a few Republican) lawmakers blasted it** as morally reprehensible and strategically unsound\u301040\u2020L207-L215\u3011. They noted Trump gave *no legal basis* for how the U.S. could \u201ctake over\u201d a foreign territory by force\u301040\u2020L199-L207\u3011. Deploying U.S. troops to occupy Gaza \u2013 something every previous administration, including Trump\u2019s first term, avoided\u301039\u2020L35-L43\u3011 \u2013 would be extraordinarily risky. The prospect of American soldiers policing Gaza\u2019s ruins elicited warnings of becoming stuck in an endless quagmire. \n\nIn essence, Trump\u2019s Gaza scheme was a maximalist \u201cdeal\u201d that **ignored the core interests of one side entirely** \u2013 he envisioned Israel (and perhaps the U.S.) as the winners \u201cowning\u201d Gaza, and Palestinians as the losers who simply get removed. This is distributive bargaining taken to an extreme, literally attempting to **\u201cdistribute\u201d land without regard for the people living on it**. It epitomizes the adjunct professor\u2019s critique: Trump proposed a binary, winner-take-all solution to a problem that experts agree requires careful integrative compromise. No serious peace process would suggest depopulating Gaza; that Trump did so underscores how unconventional (and contentious) his approach is. Some analysts mused that **Trump might not have fully intended this as policy** \u2013 that he could be staking out an extreme position as a form of shock negotiation, to later retreat to something less extreme (shifting the Overton window). Indeed, taking outrageous opening positions *\u201csometimes takes place in negotiation\u201d*, as one expert noted, and *\u201cTrump is showing willingness to puncture conventional thinking.\u201d*\u301039\u2020L47-L55\u3011 But the danger is such rhetoric can inflame and harden positions rather than lead to productive bargaining. \n\nEven Israel is wary: Netanyahu did not endorse mass expulsion; he\u2019s under pressure from far-right partners to deal harshly with Hamas but also knows outright U.S. occupation is unrealistic. Observers pointed out that **Trump\u2019s proposal lacked any detail on *how* the U.S. would assume authority or who would govern Gaza**\u301040\u2020L159-L168\u3011\u301040\u2020L197-L205\u3011. It appeared to be more of a grandiose idea than a fleshed-out plan. Nonetheless, its mere utterance by a U.S. President is significant \u2013 it signals a willingness to break taboos and pursue **\u201cexpansionist\u201d aims** in the Middle East\u301037\u2020L259-L267\u3011. For supporters, this boldness is refreshing: they argue previous administrations were stuck in failed paradigms, whereas Trump is *\u201cthinking outside the box with fresh ideas.\u201d*\u301039\u2020L45-L53\u3011 They believe his business-minded approach \u2013 seeing Gaza\u2019s economic potential if unencumbered by conflict \u2013 could bring new solutions (e.g., an international trusteeship for Gaza, albeit not as radical as he stated). Critics respond that some boxes should not be broken: international law and human rights are lines that shouldn\u2019t be crossed in pursuit of an \u201cAmerica can fix it\u201d deal. \n\n### Hard-Line vs. Strategic Cooperation  \nIn both Ukraine and the Middle East, Trump\u2019s early actions show a **penchant for high-risk, high-reward bargaining**. He seeks to rewrite rules and force breakthroughs, reflecting a view that **bold unilateral action can solve longstanding conflicts**. This is very much a *zero-sum, winner-loser philosophy*: in his mind, prior leaders were \u201closers\u201d who failed to solve these issues, and he as the deal-maker will craft a scenario where the U.S. and its allies \u201cwin\u201d \u2013 be it through peace on America\u2019s terms or by literally taking territory. \n\nHowever, the international responses illustrate why integrative, collaborative approaches have historically been favored. Allies pushing back on the rare-earths-for-aid demand or the Gaza plan highlight that **Trump\u2019s proposals often neglect the needs and dignity of other stakeholders**. Successful conflict resolution usually requires each side to feel their core concerns are addressed (even if neither gets everything). Trump\u2019s initial offers instead tend to heavily favor one side (the side he perceives as aligned with U.S. or personal interests) and minimize the other\u2019s interests \u2013 a hallmark of distributive deal-making. \n\nFor example, in Yemen, designating the Houthis terrorists without humanitarian carve-outs may please Saudi Arabia (a \u201cwin\u201d for them and Trump\u2019s anti-Iran stance) but it imperils aid to Yemeni civilians (\u201closs\u201d for innocents, and arguably for U.S. moral standing). A more integrative approach might have been to condition the terror listing on certain Houthi concessions, coupling it with assurances of aid delivery \u2013 but Trump\u2019s style is more cut-and-dry, signaling absolute support to one side. Likewise, in Ukraine, a truly integrative strategy would involve tight coordination with Europe and ensuring Russia, Ukraine, and NATO all have a stake in the final security arrangement. Trump\u2019s approach thus far has been more unilateral and transactional, which runs the risk of undermining the very coalition that gave sanctions on Russia their bite.\n\nTo his credit, **Trump has shown some flexibility and unexpected turns**: for instance, despite his saber-rattling, he used his video appearance at Davos to call for new U.S.\u2013Russia\u2013China arms control talks to reduce nuclear arsenals\u301043\u2020L477-L485\u3011. This surprised many and suggests he does see value in *some* cooperative great-power engagement (perhaps because an arms deal could be spun as a win-win achievement). His administration also quietly softened earlier rhetoric about quitting NATO; officials clarified that **the U.S. will remain in NATO**, and Trump even praised allies who met defense spending targets\u301043\u2020L475-L483\u3011. These indicate that even a largely distributive negotiator like Trump recognizes certain alliances and agreements are too critical to abandon. In those cases, he is instead trying to *renegotiate within* the framework (e.g. pushing NATO members to pay more, rather than leaving NATO outright). One could interpret this as a blend of strategies: **distributive methods (threats, demands) employed to achieve an integrative outcome (a stronger NATO where burden-sharing is more equal)**. Whether that actually fosters unity or resentment is the question.\n\n## Distributive vs. Integrative: Balancing the Analysis  \nTrump\u2019s first few weeks in office provide concrete evidence for the adjunct professor\u2019s argument about his heavy reliance on **distributive bargaining**. Time and again, we see Trump framing international engagements as transactions with winners and losers:\n\n- **Zero-Sum Mindset:** From imposing tariffs, to freezing aid, to demanding resources for aid, Trump\u2019s default is *\u201cWhat can the U.S. get, and who will give it up?\u201d* \u2013 classic zero-sum. As the professor succinctly put it, *\u201cDistributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser\u201d*\u30103\u2020L198-L205\u3011, and Trump appears comfortable ascribing that framework to foreign relations. He often touts how much more the U.S. will \u201cwin\u201d \u2013 more money from tariffs\u30107\u2020L1-L9\u3011, more respect by being tough, etc. \u2013 implying others will yield or lose out. In his view, past leaders were too willing to let the U.S. be the loser (paying too much, getting exploited), and he\u2019s here to flip the script.\n\n- **Evidence in Policy:** Each major early policy bears that stamp:\n  - The blanket China tariff assumes the U.S. can pressure China into concessions without equivalent cost \u2013 an attempt to *\u201cwin\u201d* a bilateral economic contest\u301025\u2020L165-L173\u3011\u301025\u2020L171-L179\u3011.\n  - The aid freeze posits that the U.S. loses by giving, unless it gains politically \u2013 essentially treating foreign aid as a bad deal unless renegotiated\u301032\u2020L126-L134\u3011.\n  - The Gaza plan literally imagines one side (Israel/US) taking all, the other side giving all \u2013 a pure win-lose outcome\u301040\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301039\u2020L73-L81\u3011.\n  - Even the approach to allies like Canada/Mexico was coercive: threaten pain to extract gain\u301027\u2020L210-L218\u3011.\n  \n  These examples strongly support the notion that **Trump is applying a transactional, deal-maker lens to areas typically handled via diplomacy and alliance-building**. \n\n- **Limits of Distributive Approach:** The early fallout also illustrates the **limitations and perils** of such an approach in the global arena. Other nations are not passive counterparties \u2013 they respond in kind or seek alternatives, as seen with China\u2019s calibrated retaliation and outreach to others\u301025\u2020L188-L196\u3011. As David Honig (the adjunct professor) noted, *\u201cnegotiations aren\u2019t binary\u201d* in international affairs; countries have multiple options and can band together, which *\u201cstrips the distributive bargainer of his power to win\u201d*\u30103\u2020L214-L222\u3011. Indeed, we have seen nascent balancing acts: the EU positioning itself to negotiate firmly, allies like Germany openly criticizing U.S. demands, and adversaries like Russia waiting out U.S. pressure. Honig\u2019s earlier example from the 2018 trade war \u2013 China buying soy from elsewhere, hurting U.S. farmers\u30104\u2020L238-L246\u3011 \u2013 is a cautionary tale that likely resonates now as farmers again worry about export markets under new tariffs. In diplomacy, **success is rarely zero-sum**; Trump\u2019s one-sided moves have already yielded concessions in some cases (Mexico\u2019s border pledge), but at the expense of goodwill and potentially stability (e.g. foreign aid freeze causing chaos in aid programs). \n\n- **Need for Integrative Solutions:** Complex issues such as climate change, pandemics, or multi-party conflicts *demand* integrative bargaining \u2013 solutions where all stakeholders gain something. Trump\u2019s skepticism of these efforts (Paris accord, WHO, etc.) may rally his base, but it doesn\u2019t make the underlying problems go away. As the professor bluntly said, *\u201cIf you attempt distributive bargaining [in such cases], success is impossible.\u201d*\u30104\u2020L233-L242\u3011 The coming months will test whether Trump can adjust tactics to achieve genuine agreements. For example, if he truly seeks a Ukraine peace deal, he may find that unilateral ultimatums give way to multilateral talks involving Europeans \u2013 a shift toward integrative diplomacy out of necessity.\n\n- **Alternate Interpretations:** In fairness, not everything Trump has done is purely zero-sum. One could argue that his outreach to Xi about Ukraine or his call for trilateral nuclear talks are *elements of integrative strategy*, acknowledging that great powers working together might yield better outcomes\u301029\u2020L182-L189\u3011\u301043\u2020L477-L485\u3011. Supporters highlight these to argue **Trump isn\u2019t opposed to cooperation per se; he just wants cooperation on *his terms***. They also claim that Trump\u2019s bluster often *opens bargaining space*. A pattern in his first term was to make extreme demands, then accept a middle-ground deal (for instance, threatening to terminate NAFTA entirely, but ultimately signing a modified NAFTA \u2013 USMCA \u2013 that all three nations found acceptable). In that sense, some see a method to the madness: a \u201cmadman theory\u201d of negotiation where Trump\u2019s hardline stance is a starting point from which a more moderate agreement can be reached, with the U.S. still better off than before. \n\nFrom a balanced perspective, one must consider that **Trump\u2019s style has yielded some tangible outcomes**: Mexico did deploy more troops to curb migration after tariff threats; NATO allies did increase defense spending modestly after being berated; even China agreed to a Phase-1 trade deal in 2020 under tariff pressure. His supporters view these as vindication that a tough distributive approach *can* force integrative results (each side giving something in the end, though under duress). Critics counter that these were narrow or short-term wins and that Trump often fails to follow through on the integrative part \u2013 preferring to declare victory and move on, sometimes leaving implementation or broader resolution incomplete. For example, the Phase-1 China deal eased tensions but didn\u2019t solve core issues, and now a broader conflict re-erupted with the 2025 tariffs. \n\nIn evaluating Trump\u2019s early foreign policy through the lens of negotiation strategy, it appears **he overwhelmingly favors a zero-sum, \u201cAmerica wins\u201d framework**. The adjunct professor\u2019s depiction is largely affirmed: Trump approaches global affairs as if they were business deals to be won, an approach he honed in the private sector. This can yield decisive action (no endless committee meetings for Trump \u2013 he\u2019ll slap a tariff or break an accord quickly to assert leverage). However, diplomacy is not a one-off real estate deal; it\u2019s an ongoing relationship. The risk of Trump\u2019s distributive bargaining is **long-term erosion of U.S. partnerships and global standing**, as partners tire of being treated as opponents or \u201cprey\u201d in Trump\u2019s win-lose view. Already, we see allied leaders emphasizing that they too *\u201cwill always protect our own interests\u201d* if the U.S. goes rogue\u301027\u2020L219-L227\u3011. In other words, others may adopt the same zero-sum posture, leading to fragmentation of the international order into competitive blocs rather than cooperative alliances.\n\n## Conclusion: A New Chapter of \u201cAmerica First\u201d \u2013 At What Cost?  \nIn just the first weeks of his administration, Donald Trump has dramatically redirected U.S. foreign policy and trade, underscoring his commitment to an **\u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda that often casts aside cooperative norms**. We have observed major policy decisions \u2013 broad tariffs and trade confrontations, withdrawals from climate and health agreements, freezes on foreign aid, and unorthodox diplomatic proposals \u2013 all of which indicate a return to the combative, transactional style of Trump\u2019s first term, now taken even further. These actions have indeed validated the concerns of experts like David Honig, who argue that **Trump relies on distributive bargaining (win-lose deals) in a global context that usually requires integrative solutions (win-win compromises)**\u30103\u2020L214-L222\u3011.\n\nEarly international responses show a world adjusting to this reality: some leaders acquiesce or make quick concessions to avoid Trump\u2019s wrath, while others prepare to push back or find workarounds. The **balance of reactions** \u2013 from China\u2019s careful retaliation to Europe\u2019s guarded resistance, from allies\u2019 quiet alarm to rivals\u2019 attempts to capitalize \u2013 suggests that Trump\u2019s approach is already testing alliances and could spur unintended consequences. Critics fear a more isolated America, trade wars damaging the global economy, and diplomatic crises worsened by lack of nuance. Supporters counter that Trump is *finally* demanding fairness and decisive outcomes, breaking paralysis on issues like Ukraine and Middle East peace (however contentious his methods).\n\nIt is still early in Trump\u2019s second term experiment. It\u2019s possible that initial hard-line moves will give way to negotiated settlements (for instance, a new trade understanding with China or a framework for Ukraine peace). If so, Trump will credit his tough stance for any eventual deal \u2013 and indeed, **distributive tactics can be part of a larger strategy** if followed by pragmatic compromise. The key question is whether Trump *will* pivot to integrative bargaining when needed, or if his zero-sum instincts will dominate even when cooperation is the wiser path. As one analysis noted, **the world is watching to see if the U.S. will continue to operate within international institutions or target them next**\u301043\u2020L471-L479\u3011. Many traditional U.S. allies hope for the former and are trying to engage the Trump administration carefully, praising him where possible (Netanyahu\u2019s flattery, Zelensky\u2019s alignment with some rhetoric) to keep channels open.\n\nIn summary, Donald Trump\u2019s early foreign policy and trade actions project strength and clarity of purpose \u2013 the U.S. will vigorously pursue its interests, even if it means upending established norms. This undeniably **reflects a winner-loser approach** to global affairs. However, the complexities of the world stage may yet compel more give-and-take than Trump\u2019s opening gambits imply. A balanced perspective recognizes that while Trump\u2019s style is confrontational and often unilateral, international pressures and internal advisers could steer some decisions toward more *strategic cooperation*. For example, Trump\u2019s surprising call for nuclear arms talks hints that he is not immune to the appeal of a legacy-defining, cooperative achievement\u301043\u2020L477-L485\u3011. \n\nUltimately, the coming weeks and months will reveal whether Trump\u2019s America First agenda yields pragmatic deals or heightened conflicts. **Will his hard bargaining bring partners to heel and adversaries to agreement, or will it cement a \u201cnew normal\u201d of global zero-sum rivalry?** The answer may determine if Trump can truly claim foreign-policy \u201cwins\u201d in the eyes of history, or if, as skeptics warn, his approach will leave everyone worse off \u2013 the classic outcome when negotiators see the world as a pie to be fought over, rather than a problem to be solved together. For now, Trump has made one thing clear: the U.S. is bargaining hard, and it\u2019s up to the rest of the world to decide how to respond. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Executive actions and trade measures from Week 1 of the Trump administration\u301014\u2020L200-L209\u3011\u301014\u2020L224-L232\u3011\u301012\u2020L211-L218\u3011; Reuters and AP reports on new China tariffs and allied reactions\u301025\u2020L165-L174\u3011\u301027\u2020L210-L218\u3011; expert commentary on Trump\u2019s trade stance\u30103\u2020L196-L204\u3011\u30103\u2020L214-L222\u3011.  \n- Details on foreign aid freeze and global program impacts\u301032\u2020L105-L114\u3011\u301032\u2020L126-L134\u3011; Chatham House analysis of Trump\u2019s rejection of international institutions\u301043\u2020L429-L438\u3011\u301043\u2020L459-L467\u3011.  \n- Reversal of Biden\u2019s policies on Israeli settlements and Yemen Houthis\u301035\u2020L167-L176\u3011\u301035\u2020L178-L186\u3011\u301011\u2020L423-L430\u3011.  \n- Ukraine policy shifts \u2013 Trump\u2019s aid-for-resources deal and sanctions threats\u301021\u2020L113-L121\u3011\u301021\u2020L132-L140\u3011\u301029\u2020L169-L177\u3011; Wilson Center and Reuters insights on Trump\u2019s negotiation approach with Zelensky and Putin\u301019\u2020L319-L327\u3011\u301029\u2020L182-L189\u3011.  \n- Middle East developments \u2013 Trump\u2019s Gaza takeover proposal and international condemnation\u301040\u2020L177-L185\u3011\u301039\u2020L73-L81\u3011; reactions from Netanyahu and regional players\u301039\u2020L45-L53\u3011\u301037\u2020L263-L272\u3011.  \n- Adjunct professor David Honig\u2019s negotiation analysis of Trump\u2019s zero-sum mindset vs. integrative needs\u30103\u2020L214-L222\u3011\u30104\u2020L238-L246\u3011."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":938,"end_ix":952,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Trump in no hurry to talk to Xi amid new tariff war | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-tariffs-chinese-imports-take-effect-after-trump-reprieves-canada-mexico-2025-02-04/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2FBEIJING%2C%20Feb%204%20%28Reuters%29%20,tariffs%20on%20all%20Chinese%20imports","text":"WASHINGTON/BEIJING, Feb 4 (Reuters) -

There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren\u2019t binary. China\u2019s choices aren\u2019t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don\u2019t buy soybeans.
