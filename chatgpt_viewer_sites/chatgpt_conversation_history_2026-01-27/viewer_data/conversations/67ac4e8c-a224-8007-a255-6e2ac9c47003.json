This is mandated by the Companies Act (Cap. 50) and overseen by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). Section 171 of the Companies Act specifies that **each company must have a secretary**, who must be a natural person ordinarily resident in Singapore\u301017\u2020L1-L4\u3011. The appointment must be made **within six months of incorporation**, and the position cannot be left vacant for more than six months at any time\u301016\u2020L11-L17\u3011. Failure to appoint a secretary within the stipulated timeframe can result in penalties (up to S$1,000 fine for directors) for non-compliance\u301016\u2020L11-L17\u3011. \n\nImportantly, **the same individual cannot be both the sole director and the company secretary** of the company\u301017\u2020L1-L4\u3011. In practice, this means if a company has only one director, that person **cannot** concurrently serve as secretary. However, if the company has **multiple directors**, one of them is permitted to also act as the company secretary\u301017\u2020L1-L4\u3011\u301017\u2020L11-L14\u3011. In the scenario given (a small private limited company with two directors), one of the directors can indeed serve as the company secretary in compliance with this rule.\n\nBeyond the basic appointment requirement, the Companies Act also places responsibility on the board to ensure the secretary is capable of fulfilling the role. Specifically, the Act states that **directors must take all reasonable steps to ensure the appointed secretary is a person with the \u201crequisite knowledge and experience\u201d to discharge the functions of a company secretary**\u301014\u2020L1-L7\u3011. While the law for **private companies** does not mandate formal qualifications (unlike for public listed companies, which have stricter qualification criteria under s171(1AA)), it implies that the secretary should be sufficiently trained or experienced in corporate compliance matters\u30107\u2020L1-L4\u3011. ACRA's guidelines echo this, emphasizing that the secretary should be competent to **advise on and ensure compliance** with the Companies Act and other regulations.\n\nACRA provides official guidance on the appointment of a company secretary and other key officers. According to ACRA, a company secretary **must** be: (a) a natural person, (b) an **ordinarily resident** of Singapore (e.g., a Singapore citizen, Permanent Resident, or someone with an Employment Pass and local address), and (c) **not the sole director** of the company\u301017\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Table 1 below summarizes the qualifications and eligibility criteria for a company secretary of a private limited company, as required by Singapore law (excluding qualifications specific to public companies).\n\n## Qualifications for a Company Secretary (Private Company)\n\nThe table below outlines the key qualifications and eligibility requirements for a company secretary of a Singapore private limited company. (Note: Additional qualifications apply to public company secretaries \u2013 e.g. professional certifications or prior experience \u2013 but these do **not** apply to private companies and are omitted here, per the question's scope.)\n\n| **Requirement**                | **Details**                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Legal Status**              | Must be a **natural person** (individual). Corporate entities cannot act as company secretary\u301017\u2020L1-L4\u3011.                                                       |\n| **Residency**                 | Must be **ordinarily resident in Singapore** \u2013 typically a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident, or a holder of an appropriate work pass\u301017\u2020L1-L4\u3011. ACRA considers 'ordinarily resident' to include EntrePass/Employment Pass holders with a local address. |\n| **Minimum Age & Capacity**    | At least **18 years old** and of full legal capacity (not an undischarged bankrupt or otherwise disqualified). *Minors cannot hold this office*\u30105\u2020L1-L4\u3011.       |\n| **Sole Director Restriction** | **Cannot be the sole director** of the company at the same time\u301017\u2020L1-L4\u3011. (If the company has only one director, a different person must be appointed as secretary. If the company has 2 or more directors, one of the directors can also serve as secretary\u301017\u2020L11-L14\u3011.) |\n| **Requisite Knowledge**       | Should possess the **knowledge and experience** necessary to perform the duties of a secretary. The **directors are legally obliged** to ensure the secretary is capable of fulfilling the role\u301014\u2020L1-L7\u3011. (For private companies, no specific certifications are required; this is a general duty of competence.) |\n| **Formal Qualifications**     | *No formal certification required by law for private company secretaries.* (In contrast, **public companies** must appoint a secretary who meets certain professional qualifications or experience thresholds\u30107\u2020L1-L4\u3011, such as being a qualified accountant or having been a secretary of a company for at least 3 of the last 5 years. This does **not** apply to a private limited company.) |\n\n**Table 1: Requirements and Qualifications for a Company Secretary of a Private Limited Company in Singapore.**\n\n## Obligations of the Company and Compliance Requirements\n\nA Singapore private limited company must fulfill various statutory obligations to remain in good standing. These obligations can be categorized into **initial filings (upon incorporation)**, **recurring annual requirements**, and **other ongoing administrative duties**. The company secretary plays a pivotal role in **ensuring compliance** with all of these. Below, we outline the key obligations, along with their timelines and relevant regulatory references, and explain how the company secretary assists in each area.\n\n### Initial Compliance Obligations (Post-Incorporation)\n\nUpon incorporation of a company, certain filings and compliance tasks must be completed in the early stages of the company's existence. Table 2 highlights the **initial obligations** that a newly incorporated private company in Singapore must fulfill, typically in the first days and months after incorporation:\n\n| **Initial Obligation**                  | **Description & Requirements**                                                                                                                                                 | **Deadline/Timeframe**                          | **Relevant Law / Authority**                                   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Appoint Company Secretary**           | Appoint at least one company secretary who meets the requirements (as detailed above). The secretary\u2019s details must be lodged with ACRA (via BizFile, the online filing system). The company must not leave this position vacant for >6 months at any time\u301016\u2020L11-L17\u3011. The appointed secretary must consent to act (typically documented via Form 45B). | **Within 6 months of incorporation**\u301016\u2020L11-L17\u3011. (Must be continually filled; any vacancy >6 months is an offense.) | Companies Act, s171(1) and s171(1B); ACRA guideline\u301016\u2020L11-L17\u3011. Penalty for late appointment: fine up to S$1,000 on directors\u301016\u2020L11-L17\u3011. |\n| **Appoint Auditor (if required)**       | Appoint a licensed auditor for the company, **unless exempted** from audit requirements. Small private companies that qualify as *small companies* or *dormant companies* are exempt from needing an auditor. If not exempt, directors must appoint an auditor and notify ACRA of the appointment. | **Within 3 months of incorporation**\u301018\u2020L13-L17\u3011 (if an audit is required). | Companies Act, s205. ACRA/Companies Act mandate appointment of auditor within 3 months if the company must be audited\u301018\u2020L13-L17\u3011. |\n| **First Board Meeting & Internal Setup** | *(Internal compliance step, not an ACRA filing)*. Hold an initial board meeting to formalize the appointments of directors, secretary, and (if applicable) auditors, adopt the company constitution, issue initial share certificates to subscribers, and record the company\u2019s registered office address. The company secretary usually prepares minutes/resolutions for these actions. | **Soon after incorporation** (no fixed statutory deadline, but best practice is within the first month). | Companies Act (general compliance). Initial resolutions and documentation ensure the company is properly organized \u2013 e.g., Companies Act s. 142 (share certificates issuance) and others for record-keeping. |\n| **Register of Registrable Controllers** | Create the **Register of Registrable Controllers (RORC)**, which is a private register of the company\u2019s beneficial owners/controllers (individuals or entities with significant ownership or control). **Lodge controller information with ACRA\u2019s central registry** as well, as required by law\u301025\u2020L1-L4\u3011. The company must continually update this register for any changes in controllers. | **Within 30 days of incorporation** for initial lodging of controller information (from 30 July 2020 onward)\u301025\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Updates to be lodged within a specified period (usually 2 business days of any change). | Companies Act, Part XIA (Registers of Controllers). ACRA requirement to maintain and lodge a RORC: introduced in 2017, with ACRA lodgement mandated from 30 Jul 2020\u301025\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Non-compliance may result in fines. |\n| **Business Registration & Licensing**   | *(If applicable)* Obtain any necessary business licenses or registrations depending on the company\u2019s activities (not required for all companies). Ensure the company\u2019s registration number (UEN) is properly displayed on invoices and official correspondence as per ACRA guidelines. | **Upon commencement of business** (license requirements depend on industry). | Various (e.g., Business Names Registration Act, industry-specific regulations). |\n\n**Table 2: Initial Post-Incorporation Obligations for a Singapore Private Limited Company.**\n\n**Role of Company Secretary for Initial Obligations:** For a newly incorporated company, the company secretary (who may be one of the directors in our scenario) ensures that all these start-up compliance tasks are completed. This includes **filing the appointment of the company secretary and directors with ACRA**, coordinating the appointment of an auditor if one is needed, and preparing the documentation for the first board resolutions. The secretary will typically obtain and safekeep the **consent forms** of directors and the secretary (which are required under the Companies Act but kept internally), and set up the statutory registers (members, directors, etc.) immediately after incorporation. If the company needs to lodge its controllers\u2019 information with ACRA, the secretary will handle that filing on BizFile+ as well, and ensure the controllers register is maintained. Essentially, the secretary acts as the compliance administrator from the get-go, making sure the company starts off meeting all legal requirements.\n\n### Recurring Annual Compliance Obligations\n\nThroughout the life of the company, there are **annual filings and events** defined by Singapore law that the company must adhere to. Key recurring obligations include holding annual general meetings, filing annual returns with ACRA, and filing tax returns with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). Table 3 summarizes the main recurring compliance requirements:\n\n| **Recurring Obligation**         | **Description & Requirements**                                                                                                                                       | **Frequency / Deadline**                                            | **Relevant Law / Authority**                                          |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Annual General Meeting (AGM)** | The AGM is a meeting of shareholders to table the company\u2019s financial statements and address any statutory business (e.g., re-appointment of auditors if applicable). For **private companies**, the law allows **some flexibility**: a private company may choose to dispense with holding an AGM if all members approve a resolution to do so, or if the company sends financial statements to shareholders within 5 months after the Financial Year End and there are no requests to hold an AGM\u301019\u2020L7-L9\u3011. If an AGM is held, it must approve the financial statements (which must be not more than 6 months old by AGM date per Companies Act s201). The **first AGM** of a new company can be held up to 18 months from incorporation\u301019\u2020L37-L40\u3011. | **Annually**: Within **6 months after the company\u2019s Financial Year End (FYE)** for non-listed companies\u301019\u2020L37-L40\u3011. *(If the company qualifies and opts to dispense with AGM, it must still circulate financial statements to shareholders within 5 months of FYE, and any member can still request an AGM within a certain timeframe.)* The first AGM can be held within 18 months of incorporation\u301019\u2020L37-L40\u3011. | Companies Act, s175 (AGM timing) and s201 (financial statements at AGM). ACRA allows AGM waivers for private companies under amended provisions\u301019\u2020L7-L9\u3011. |\n| **Financial Statements Preparation** | Prepare the company\u2019s **annual financial statements** in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS). Even if audit-exempt, the company must prepare financial statements for shareholders. If the company requires an audit (not exempt), the **audited statements** must be ready in time for the AGM. The statements typically include the balance sheet, income statement, notes, etc., and directors\u2019 declarations. | **Annually**: Financial statements are usually drawn up after FYE. If an AGM is to be held, the statements must be made up to a date no more than 6 months before the AGM (to be \u201cfresh\u201d as per Companies Act s201\u301012\u2020L9-L12\u3011). Companies often target finalizing accounts within 3-4 months after FYE (especially if audit is needed). | Companies Act, s201 (requirements for financial statements). If audit is required, Companies Act, s207 and auditing standards apply. |\n| **Annual Return (AR) Filing**    | File the Annual Return with ACRA via BizFile+. The AR is an electronic filing that confirms the company\u2019s key particulars (directors, secretary, registered office, shareholders, share capital, etc.) and compliance with AGM/financial statement requirements. For solvent small companies, simplified annual return filing is allowed (financial statements may not need to be attached for a solvent *exempt private company*). If the company has *audited accounts* or is not exempt, the financial statements (in XBRL format or PDF as required) must be filed with the AR. | **Annually**: Within **7 months after FYE** for a private company\u301019\u2020L1-L4\u3011. (For reference, listed companies have a 5-month deadline; private companies get 7 months.) If an AGM was held, the AR should be filed *within 7 months of FYE* (which typically equates to within 1 month after a 6-month AGM deadline). If the AGM was dispensed with, the AR is still due within 7 months of FYE. | Companies Act, s197 (Annual Return timeline)\u301019\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Filing is done with ACRA (BizFile portal). Late filing incurs penalties from ACRA. |\n| **Corporate Income Tax Filings** | Fulfill tax filing obligations with IRAS. This involves two main filings each year:<ul><li>**Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI)** \u2013 a short estimate of the company\u2019s taxable profit for the year, filed **within 3 months after FYE**\u301024\u2020L12-L15\u3011, unless the company qualifies for a waiver (e.g., if annual revenue is below a threshold or ECI is nil). Filing the ECI allows IRAS to issue timely tax instalments.</li><li>**Annual Tax Return (Form C or Form C-S)** \u2013 a full tax return with details of income, deductions, and the finalized accounts. This is filed in the **Year of Assessment (YA)** following the financial year. For example, for financial year ending 31 Dec 2024, the YA 2025 tax return is due. The deadline is typically **30 Nov** (paper filing) or **15 Dec** (electronic filing via myTax Portal) of the YA.</li></ul> | **Annually**: ECI within 3 months of FYE\u301024\u2020L12-L15\u3011; Tax Return by 30 Nov/15 Dec of the next year (YA). (If the company is dormant or has no taxable income, it may be exempted from filing ECI or a simplified return, but it must still respond to IRAS filing requests.) | Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) \u2013 IRAS requires all companies to file annual tax returns. IRAS guidelines mandate ECI filing within 3 months of FYE\u301024\u2020L12-L15\u3011. Failure to file on time can result in IRAS enforcement actions (estimated assessments, fines). |\n| **GST Filings (if applicable)** | If the company is GST-registered (i.e., it has opted or is required to collect Goods and Services Tax), it must file periodic GST returns with IRAS. Most companies file quarterly GST returns (Form F5), reporting output tax collected and input tax claimed, and pay any net GST due. | **Quarterly** (standard quarterly periods) \u2013 GST returns are due one month after the end of each accounting period (quarter). e.g., Q1 (Jan\u2013Mar) GST return due by end of April. | Goods and Services Tax Act \u2013 mandates periodic GST filing and payment. (This applies only if the company is GST-registered, typically when annual revenue exceeds S$1 million or voluntarily registered.) |\n\n**Table 3: Key Recurring (Annual) Compliance Obligations for a Singapore Private Limited Company.**\n\n**Role of Company Secretary for Recurring Obligations:** The company secretary is central to meeting annual compliance deadlines:\n\n- **AGM:** The secretary will **coordinate the AGM** logistics or the preparation of written resolutions if the AGM is dispensed with. This includes preparing the **notice of AGM** (or consent resolutions), compiling the financial statements and reports to be presented, and drafting minutes of the meeting. If the company opts not to hold an AGM (under the permissible rules for private companies), the secretary ensures that financial statements are circulated to shareholders on time and will keep records of shareholders\u2019 written resolutions approving the accounts. The secretary also tracks the due date for holding the AGM (or the deadline for opting out) to ensure the company does not breach Section 175 of the Act\u301019\u2020L37-L40\u3011.\n\n- **Annual Return:** The secretary typically **prepares and files the Annual Return (AR)** on ACRA\u2019s BizFile+ system. This involves verifying that all company particulars are up to date (e.g., any changes in directors, address, or share capital during the year have been properly recorded) and confirming that the necessary financial documents are ready. The AR filing is essentially the company\u2019s yearly compliance snapshot to ACRA, and the secretary ensures it is submitted within the 7-month deadline\u301019\u2020L1-L4\u3011. If the company is required to file financial statements (in XBRL format), the secretary coordinates this process (often working with accountants to generate the XBRL file). \n\n- **Financial Statements and Audit:** The secretary works with the company\u2019s finance team or external accountants to **ensure the annual financial statements are prepared on time**. If an auditor is appointed, the secretary liaises with the auditors to schedule the audit and get the audited accounts finalized before the AGM deadline. The secretary also ensures that directors sign off on the statements and the Directors\u2019 Statement as required by law, and that these documents are ready for presentation to shareholders.\n\n- **Tax Filings:** While tax filings are often prepared by accountants or tax agents, the secretary plays a coordinating role. The secretary **reminds the management of IRAS deadlines** and may assist in providing corporate information needed for the filings. For example, the secretary might work with accountants to file the ECI within 3 months of year-end\u301024\u2020L12-L15\u3011 and make sure the full Form C/C-S is submitted by the due date. The secretary also keeps official records of these filings and any correspondence with IRAS. In case of any changes in the company\u2019s financial year or particulars, the secretary would update ACRA (and these changes automatically get transmitted to IRAS\u2019s records)\u301020\u2020L6-L9\u3011.\n\nIn summary, for recurring obligations, the company secretary acts as the **compliance calendar keeper and filing officer** \u2013 keeping track of key dates, preparing the necessary documents, and completing the statutory filings so that the company meets all annual requirements in a timely manner.\n\n### Other Ongoing Administrative Duties and Compliance Tasks\n\nIn addition to the fixed initial and annual filings, a company must **continually comply** with various other requirements under the Companies Act. These generally relate to keeping the company\u2019s information current and maintaining proper corporate records. The **company secretary\u2019s day-to-day duties** largely revolve around these ongoing compliance tasks. Some of the key administrative duties include:\n\n- **Maintaining Statutory Registers:** The company is required to maintain up-to-date statutory registers, including the **Register of Members (shareholders)**, Register of Directors, Register of Company Secretaries, **Register of Charges** (if the company has charges on its assets), and the **Register of Registrable Controllers**. The company secretary is responsible for keeping these registers accurate and updated whenever there are changes\u301023\u2020L5-L9\u3011. For example, if shares are transferred or allotted, the secretary updates the Register of Members; if a new director is appointed or an existing one resigns, the details are updated in the directors\u2019 register, and so on. These registers must be available for inspection by authorized people (directors, auditors, regulators) upon request.\n\n- **Notifying ACRA of Changes:**  Whenever certain company information changes, the company must file notices with ACRA within a prescribed time. Common changes that require filing include:\n  - **Change of Registered Office Address** \u2013 must be notified to ACRA within 14 days of the change\u301020\u2020L1-L4\u3011.\n  - **Change of Officers** (appointment or resignation of directors, the secretary, or auditors) \u2013 file with ACRA within 14 days of the change (Companies Act s173).\n  - **Change in Officers\u2019 Particulars** (like a change in a director\u2019s residential address or name) \u2013 also typically 14 days to update.\n  - **Share Allotments** \u2013 any new issuance of shares must be filed via a \u201cReturn of Allotment\u201d to ACRA within 14 days of the allotment (Companies Act s71).\n  - **Share Transfers** \u2013 while share transfers in private companies do not require filing to ACRA if they do not change the total share capital, the company must update its internal member register and issue new share certificates. The secretary oversees this process and may elect to file a clarification with ACRA if needed (like updating shareholder information in the next annual return).\n  - **Changes to Company Name or Constitution** \u2013 if the company passes a special resolution to change its name or to amend its Constitution (formerly Memorandum & Articles of Association), this must be lodged with ACRA within 14 days as well. Name change is effected by ACRA upon approval (with a new Certificate of Incorporation issued), and constitutional changes are filed as well.\n  \n  The company secretary typically prepares the necessary **board resolutions or shareholders\u2019 resolutions** to approve such changes and then files the notifications on BizFile. For instance, if the company\u2019s registered office moves to a new location, the secretary will draft a board resolution to record the change and then lodge a \u201cChange of Registered Office Address\u201d transaction in ACRA\u2019s system within the 14-day deadline\u301020\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Similarly, for a director\u2019s resignation, the secretary will secure the proper resignation letter, update the registers, and file a cessation notice with ACRA.\n\n- **Meeting Administration:** The secretary handles the administrative aspects of **board meetings and shareholder meetings** beyond the AGM. This involves issuing notices for meetings, preparing meeting agendas and board papers, taking minutes, and keeping a minute book. For example, if a directors\u2019 meeting is needed to approve a significant contract or a dividend, the secretary will arrange the meeting and record the decisions. Keeping minutes is not only good governance but also part of the company\u2019s records required under the law (Companies Act requires certain decisions to be documented by resolutions).\n\n- **Custody of Common Seal and Documents:** Although the use of a common seal is no longer mandatory in Singapore (companies can execute documents by signature without a seal), if the company has a common seal, the company secretary is usually entrusted with its custody. The secretary also maintains custody of important corporate documents such as the Certificate of Incorporation, Constitution, share certificates, and copies of all official filings made to ACRA.\n\n- **Compliance with the Companies Act and Constitution:** The secretary acts as an advisor to the board on corporate compliance. They ensure that the company\u2019s actions (especially those by the directors and shareholders) are in accordance with the Companies Act and the company\u2019s Constitution. For example, if the company needs to approve a transaction that requires a special resolution of shareholders, the secretary will advise that an Extraordinary General Meeting or a written resolution is needed and coordinate the process. In essence, the secretary helps the company **adhere to corporate governance practices** and statutory procedures.\n\n- **Liaison with Regulatory Bodies:** The company secretary often serves as the primary point of contact between the company and regulatory authorities. They **report and update company information with ACRA** as described, and similarly handle correspondence with IRAS, or any other regulatory filings (for example, filings with the Ministry of Manpower if work passes are needed for employees, or with statistical boards if surveys are mandatory). The secretary ensures that any queries or instructions from government bodies are addressed promptly. As one guide notes, the company secretary\u2019s duties include **\u201creporting and updating the company's information on ACRA\u201d** and even preparing the agenda and paperwork for meetings like the AGM\u301010\u2020L19-L22\u3011.\n\n- **Supporting the Board of Directors:** In a broader governance role, the secretary keeps the board informed of deadlines and obligations. This might include circulating a **compliance checklist** or calendar each year (highlighting when the AGM, annual return, and tax filings are due), and sending reminders in advance. The secretary also Liases with external service providers (such as corporate service firms, auditors, tax advisors) to ensure all compliance aspects are covered. For instance, the secretary will work with auditors during the annual audit and ensure that any auditor appointments or resignations are properly handled and notified to ACRA\u301023\u2020L5-L9\u3011.\n\nAll these administrative duties are crucial for **ensuring the company\u2019s continuous compliance**. Table 4 provides a quick overview of some common changes/filings and how the secretary handles them:\n\n| **Change or Administrative Task**    | **Company Secretary\u2019s Action**                                         | **Timeline**               | **Reference**                                      |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Change in registered office address  | File notice of address change via BizFile+                           | Within 14 days of change   | ACRA requirement\u301020\u2020L1-L4\u3011                        |\n| Appointment or resignation of director or secretary | Lodge change in officers (appointment or cessation) on BizFile+, update registers, prepare necessary resolutions/letters | Within 14 days of change   | Companies Act s173; ACRA filing practice           |\n| Allotment of new shares              | Prepare board resolution for allotment, issue share certificates, file Return of Allotment with ACRA | Within 14 days of allotment| Companies Act s71                                  |\n| Transfer of shares                   | Process share transfer forms, cancel/issue share certificates, update Register of Members, (optional: reflect changes in next AR filing) | As needed (no statutory filing to ACRA required for private co share transfer) | Companies Act s128 (register of members)           |\n| Amendment of Constitution            | Arrange for special resolution of shareholders, file the resolution and updated Constitution with ACRA | Within 14 days of resolution| Companies Act s26 and s33 (constitutional changes) |\n| Change of company name               | Reserve new name with ACRA, pass special resolution, file name change. ACRA will issue new name upon approval. | Within 14 days of resolution for name change filing | Companies Act s28; ACRA procedure                  |\n| Removal or change of auditor         | If an auditor is appointed or removed (often at AGM), file a notice of auditor change with ACRA; update records. | Within 14 days of change   | Companies Act s205, s205B; ACRA notification       |\n| Maintaining registers & minutes      | Continuously update statutory registers; prepare minutes for board and general meetings; keep records at registered office. | Ongoing duty (no deadline, but must be up-to-date) | Companies Act (various sections for registers)\u301023\u2020L5-L9\u3011 |\n\n**Table 4: Examples of Ongoing Compliance Tasks and the Company Secretary\u2019s Role.**\n\nAs shown above, the company secretary\u2019s responsibilities are multifaceted. By handling these tasks, the secretary ensures the company **stays in compliance with the law at all times**, not just at year-end. This reduces the risk of penalties or legal issues for failing to notify changes or maintain records. It also promotes good corporate governance by ensuring transparency and proper documentation of the company\u2019s affairs.\n\n## Key Reporting and Regulatory Bodies in Singapore Corporate Compliance\n\nSeveral regulatory bodies are involved in the corporate governance and compliance landscape in Singapore. A small private limited company primarily interacts with the following authorities:\n\n| **Regulatory Body**                                | **Role in Corporate Governance and Compliance**                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)** | ACRA is the national regulator of business entities and public accountants in Singapore. It administers the **Companies Act (Cap. 50)** and related regulations. All incorporation and company filings (e.g. annual returns, change of company information) are done through ACRA\u2019s systems. ACRA sets the statutory compliance requirements such as the 6-month deadline to appoint a company secretary\u301016\u2020L11-L17\u3011 and the 7-month deadline to file annual returns\u301019\u2020L1-L4\u3011. It also provides guidance (e.g., practice notes and FAQs) to help companies comply. ACRA has enforcement powers: it can impose fines for late filing or failure to comply with the Companies Act. For instance, ACRA requires every company to have a secretary and will levy penalties if this requirement is not met\u301016\u2020L11-L17\u3011. In essence, ACRA is the primary **reporting body** for corporate compliance \u2013 companies report their corporate information to ACRA, and ACRA ensures companies meet their legal obligations. |\n| **Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)**   | IRAS is the tax authority in Singapore, responsible for administration of the Income Tax Act, GST Act, and related tax laws. **Companies must report financial information to IRAS** annually through tax filings. This includes the Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI) within 3 months of the financial year end\u301024\u2020L12-L15\u3011 and the annual Corporate Income Tax Return (Form C/C-S). IRAS monitors these submissions to ensure companies pay the correct amount of tax. While IRAS\u2019 focus is on tax compliance rather than the Companies Act, it is a key compliance stakeholder for any company. Notably, IRAS receives updates of basic company information (like company name and address) from ACRA \u2013 changes filed with ACRA are transmitted to IRAS weekly\u301020\u2020L6-L9\u3011, which streamlines compliance. Companies must also comply with obligations such as keeping proper accounting records (a Companies Act requirement) since those records support the tax filings. Failing to file tax returns can result in IRAS summonses or fines, separate from ACRA\u2019s penalties. In summary, IRAS is the body to which the company **reports its financial results** and tax computations, complementing ACRA\u2019s role in non-financial reporting. |\n| **Others (Industry Regulators, etc.)**             | Depending on the nature of the company\u2019s business, other regulatory bodies might be involved. For example, if the company operates in a regulated industry (finance, telecoms, etc.), agencies like the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) or Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) could impose additional compliance requirements (licenses, financial returns, etc.). For employment matters, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board are relevant (ensuring proper employment contracts, work passes, and CPF contributions for employees). While these are not universal for all companies, a company secretary should be aware of any industry-specific or additional obligations and help the company comply with them. In general, **for a typical small private company**, ACRA and IRAS are the main regulators to report to for corporate governance and statutory compliance. |\n\n**Table 5: Key Bodies to which a Company and its Secretary Report for Compliance.**\n\nThe company secretary will often liaise with ACRA and IRAS on behalf of the company. For example, the secretary handles filings to **ACRA** (e.g., annual returns, changes in directorship) and may correspond with ACRA if any clarification is needed. With **IRAS**, the secretary might handle the routine ECI filing or coordinate the submission of the Form C-S, and ensure any notices from IRAS (such as tax assessments or penalty warnings) are brought to the directors\u2019 attention and addressed. By dealing with these authorities, the secretary helps the company maintain good standing in terms of both corporate law and tax law.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the **company secretary of a small private limited company in Singapore** (even when the role is held by a director of the company) is responsible for a broad range of duties centered on regulatory compliance and good corporate governance. This individual must meet certain legal qualifications (Singapore residency, not being the sole director, etc.) and is entrusted with the company\u2019s administrative and statutory obligations. From the moment of incorporation (appointing officers, setting up registers, lodging controller information) through every year of operation (AGMs, annual returns, tax filings) and any changes in between (updating ACRA on changes, maintaining records), the company secretary\u2019s role is to **ensure the company follows the law and ACRA\u2019s regulations**.\n\nBy diligently fulfilling these duties \u2013 guided by the Companies Act and ACRA\u2019s rules \u2013 the company secretary enables the directors and shareholders to focus on the business, confident that the company\u2019s compliance matters are in order. In the case of our small private company with one director acting as secretary, that director must wear a \u201ccompliance hat\u201d in addition to their director role, making sure to **stay up-to-date with regulatory requirements** and to execute all necessary filings on time. All of these practices together uphold sound corporate governance and protect the company from legal infractions. The references and regulations cited above (from the **Singapore Companies Act** and **ACRA guidelines**) provide the authoritative framework within which the company secretary operates\u301017\u2020L1-L4\u3011\u301019\u2020L1-L4\u3011, and adhering to them is essential for the company\u2019s ongoing compliance and success.\n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":499,"end_ix":509,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Appointing Directors, Company Secretary and Other Key Personnel","url":"https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/appointing-directors-company-secretary-and-other-key-personnel#:~:text=Personnel%20www,be%20the%20same%20person","text":"Personnel www.acra.gov.sg  A company secretary must be: A natural person.
