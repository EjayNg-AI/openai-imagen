This proves the lemma. \\\\(\\\\square\\\\)\\n\\nFrom \\\\(A v_{k+1} = v_k\\\\), we see in particular that none of the vectors \\\\(v_k\\\\) can be zero: if \\\\(v_{k+1} = 0\\\\) for some \\\\(k\\\\), then \\\\(v_k = A v_{k+1} = 0\\\\), and inductively this would force \\\\(v_0 = 0\\\\), contradicting our choice of \\\\(v_0\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2. The chain \\\\(v_0,\\\\dots,v_{n-1}\\\\) is linearly independent\\n\\n#### Lemma 2.\\nThe vectors \\\\(v_0, v_1,\\\\dots,v_{n-1}\\\\) are linearly independent.\\n\\n**Proof.** Suppose\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k v_k = 0.\\n\\\\]\\nApply \\\\(A^{n-1}\\\\) to this relation. For \\\\(k \\\\le n-2\\\\), we have \\\\(A^{k+1} v_k = 0\\\\) by Lemma 1, and \\\\(n-1 \\\\ge k+1\\\\), so\\n\\\\[\\nA^{n-1} v_k = A^{(n-1)-(k+1)} (A^{k+1} v_k) = 0.\\n\\\\]\\nThus all terms with \\\\(k \\\\le n-2\\\\) vanish under \\\\(A^{n-1}\\\\). For \\\\(k = n-1\\\\), we use the chain property:\\n\\\\[\\nA v_{n-1} = v_{n-2},\\\\quad A^2 v_{n-1} = A v_{n-2} = v_{n-3},\\\\ \\\\dots,\\\\ A^{n-1} v_{n-1} = v_0.\\n\\\\]\\nTherefore,\\n\\\\[\\n0 = A^{n-1} \\\\Bigl( \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k v_k \\\\Bigr) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} c_k A^{n-1} v_k + c_{n-1} A^{n-1} v_{n-1} = c_{n-1} v_0.\\n\\\\]\\nSince \\\\(v_0 \\\\neq 0\\\\), we get \\\\(c_{n-1} = 0\\\\).\\n\\nNow the original relation reduces to\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} c_k v_k = 0.\\n\\\\]\\nApply \\\\(A^{n-2}\\\\) to this shorter sum. As before, for \\\\(k \\\\le n-3\\\\) we still have \\\\(A^{n-2} v_k = 0\\\\), while\\n\\\\[\\nA^{n-2} v_{n-2} = v_0.\\n\\\\]\\nHence\\n\\\\[\\n0 = A^{n-2} \\\\Bigl( \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} c_k v_k \\\\Bigr) = c_{n-2} v_0,\\n\\\\]\\nso \\\\(c_{n-2} = 0\\\\).\\n\\nContinuing in this way with \\\\(A^{n-3}, A^{n-4},\\\\dots, A^1\\\\), we conclude successively that \\\\(c_{n-3} = c_{n-4} = \\\\dots = c_1 = c_0 = 0\\\\). Thus all coefficients are zero and the \\\\(v_k\\\\) are linearly independent. Since there are \\\\(n\\\\) of them in an \\\\(n\\\\)-dimensional space, they form a basis of \\\\(\\\\mathbb{C}^n\\\\). \\\\(\\\\square\\\\)\\n\\nLet us fix the basis\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathcal{B} = (v_0, v_1,\\\\dots, v_{n-1}).\\n\\\\]\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3. The matrix of \\\\(A\\\\) in this basis is a single nilpotent Jordan block\\n\\nIn the basis \\\\(\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\), Lemma 1 gives\\n\\\\[\\nA v_0 = 0, \\\\quad A v_k = v_{k-1} \\\\quad (k=1,\\\\dots,n-1).\\n\\\\]\\nThus the matrix \\\\(N\\\\) of \\\\(A\\\\) with respect to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\) is\\n\\\\[\\nN =\\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0\\\\\\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & \\\\cdots & 0\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0\\n\\\\end{pmatrix},\\n\\\\]\\ni.e., a single nilpotent Jordan block of size \\\\(n\\\\).\\n\\nWe will need the power \\\\(N^{n-1}\\\\).\\n\\n#### Claim.\\nFor each integer \\\\(m \\\\ge 1\\\\), the matrix \\\\(N^m\\\\) has ones on the \\\\(m\\\\)-th superdiagonal and zeros elsewhere. In particular,\\n\\\\[\\nN^{n-1} = E_{1n},\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(E_{1n}\\\\) has a single \\\\(1\\\\) in position \\\\((1,n)\\\\) and zeros elsewhere.\\n\\n**Proof.** For \\\\(m=1\\\\), this is true by the definition of \\\\(N\\\\). Suppose it holds for some \\\\(m\\\\). Then\\n\\\\[\\nN^{m+1} = N N^m\\n\\\\]\\nshifts the nonzero entries of \\\\(N^m\\\\) one step up and to the right, so the ones move from the \\\\(m\\\\)-th to the \\\\((m+1)\\\\)-st superdiagonal, and no new nonzero entries appear. Thus the claim holds for all \\\\(m\\\\) by induction. For \\\\(m = n-1\\\\), the only possible nonzero entry on the \\\\((n-1)\\\\)-st superdiagonal is at position \\\\((1,n)\\\\), so \\\\(N^{n-1} = E_{1n}\\\\). \\\\(\\\\square\\\\)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4. Translate the matrix relation into this basis\\n\\nLet \\\\(C\\\\) be the matrix of \\\\(B\\\\) in the basis \\\\(\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\). Let \\\\(S\\\\) be the change-of-basis matrix from the original standard basis to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\). Then\\n\\\\[\\nN = S^{-1} A S, \\\\quad C = S^{-1} B S.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe original relation \\\\(AB = BA^{n-1} + I\\\\) is invariant under similarity. Indeed,\\n\\\\[\\nS^{-1} A B S = (S^{-1} A S)(S^{-1} B S) = N C,\\n\\\\]\\nwhile\\n\\\\[\\nS^{-1} B A^{n-1} S = (S^{-1} B S)(S^{-1} A S)^{n-1} = C N^{n-1},\\n\\\\]\\nand\\n\\\\[\\nS^{-1} I S = I.\\n\\\\]\\nTherefore, in the basis \\\\(\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\) the relation becomes\\n\\\\[\\nN C = C N^{n-1} + I.\\n\\\\]\\nUsing \\\\(N^{n-1} = E_{1n}\\\\), this simplifies to\\n\\\\[\\nN C = C E_{1n} + I.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWrite \\\\(C = (c_{ij})\\\\). Since \\\\(E_{1n}\\\\) has a single \\\\(1\\\\) in position \\\\((1,n)\\\\), the product \\\\(C E_{1n}\\\\) has **only its \\\\(n\\\\)-th column possibly nonzero**, and that column equals the first column of \\\\(C\\\\). Concretely, if \\\\(\\\\text{col}_j(M)\\\\) denotes the \\\\(j\\\\)-th column of a matrix \\\\(M\\\\), then\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{col}_j(C E_{1n}) = \\\\begin{cases}\\n0, & j = 1,\\\\dots,n-1,\\\\\\\\[4pt]\\n\\\\text{col}_1(C), & j = n.\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 5. Entrywise analysis and contradiction\\n\\nConsider the equation\\n\\\\[\\nN C = C E_{1n} + I.\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### (a) First column: deducing \\\\(c_{n1} = 0\\\\)\\n\\nLook at the **first column** of this matrix equation. Since the first column of \\\\(C E_{1n}\\\\) is zero, we have\\n\\\\[\\nN \\\\cdot \\\\text{col}_1(C) = \\\\text{col}_1(C E_{1n}) + \\\\text{col}_1(I) = 0 + e_1 = e_1,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(e_1 = (1,0,\\\\dots,0)^T\\\\). Writing\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{col}_1(C) = (c_{11}, c_{21},\\\\dots,c_{n1})^T,\\n\\\\]\\nwe recall that multiplying by \\\\(N\\\\) shifts entries one position up:\\n\\\\[\\nN \\\\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\\\\\ x_2\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\ x_n\\\\end{pmatrix}\\n=\\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}x_2\\\\\\\\ x_3\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\ x_n\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{pmatrix}.\\n\\\\]\\nThus\\n\\\\[\\nN \\\\cdot \\\\text{col}_1(C) = (c_{21}, c_{31},\\\\dots, c_{n1}, 0)^T.\\n\\\\]\\nEquating this to \\\\(e_1 = (1,0,\\\\dots,0)^T\\\\) gives\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{cases}\\n c_{21} = 1,\\\\\\\\\\n c_{31} = 0,\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\n c_{n1} = 0.\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\nHere the equation \\\\(c_{n1} = 0\\\\) comes from the \\\\((n-1)\\\\)-st row of the vector equation (and we use \\\\(n \\\\ge 3\\\\) so that this row is distinct from the first). In particular,\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{c_{n1} = 0.}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### (b) The \\\\((n,n)\\\\)-entry: deducing \\\\(c_{n1} = -1\\\\)\\n\\nNow look at the **\\\\((n,n)\\\\)-entry** of the same equation \\\\(N C = C E_{1n} + I\\\\). The last row of \\\\(N\\\\) is zero, so the last row of \\\\(N C\\\\) is the zero row. In particular,\\n\\\\[\\n(N C)_{nn} = 0.\\n\\\\]\\nOn the right-hand side, the \\\\((n,n)\\\\)-entry of \\\\(C E_{1n}\\\\) is the entry in row \\\\(n\\\\) of the \\\\(n\\\\)-th column, which is precisely the \\\\((n,1)\\\\)-entry of \\\\(C\\\\), i.e., \\\\(c_{n1}\\\\). Adding the identity contributes \\\\(1\\\\) in this position. Thus the \\\\((n,n)\\\\)-entry of the right-hand side is\\n\\\\[\\n(C E_{1n})_{nn} + I_{nn} = c_{n1} + 1.\\n\\\\]\\nEquating \\\\((n,n)\\\\)-entries gives\\n\\\\[\\n0 = c_{n1} + 1 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad c_{n1} = -1.\\n\\\\]\\nSo we have also\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{c_{n1} = -1.}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe two boxed conclusions, \\\\(c_{n1} = 0\\\\) and \\\\(c_{n1} = -1\\\\), contradict each other. This contradiction arises from the assumption that \\\\(A\\\\) is singular.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nOur assumption that \\\\(A\\\\) is not invertible leads, via the given relation \\\\(AB = BA^{n-1} + I\\\\), to an impossible condition on the entries of the matrix of \\\\(B\\\\) in a suitable basis. Therefore, \\\\(A\\\\) must in fact be invertible.\\n\\nThus, for \\\\(n \\\\ge 3\\\\), any pair of \\\\(n \\\\times n\\\\) complex matrices \\\\(A,B\\\\) satisfying\\n\\\\(AB = BA^{n-1} + I_n\\\\) has \\\\(A\\\\) invertible. \\\\(\\\\Box\\\\)\",\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"786a02c6-e499-4ed4-94b2-a5a5590553d9","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"12f64ad0-fe48-4741-8caf-cab46ad99869"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"da77ce86-f1c5-4612-b4f1-dfaad3a3a792","children":["e1c6db42-8193-40ea-a8c3-ea94248c03da"]},"e1c6db42-8193-40ea-a8c3-ea94248c03da":{"id":"e1c6db42-8193-40ea-a8c3-ea94248c03da","message":{"id":"e1c6db42-8193-40ea-a8c3-ea94248c03da","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767759131.8245478,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"786a02c6-e499-4ed4-94b2-a5a5590553d9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"626339bc-129f-4b69-9438-a76278fad329","turn_exchange_id":"12f64ad0-fe48-4741-8caf-cab46ad99869"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"626339bc-129f-4b69-9438-a76278fad329","children":["2fea3945-ddf4-4952-9029-ded6bf023408"]},"2fea3945-ddf4-4952-9029-ded6bf023408":{"id":"2fea3945-ddf4-4952-9029-ded6bf023408","message":{"id":"2fea3945-ddf4-4952-9029-ded6bf023408","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767759132.2150695,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"786a02c6-e499-4ed4-94b2-a5a5590553d9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"e1c6db42-8193-40ea-a8c3-ea94248c03da","turn_exchange_id":"12f64ad0-fe48-4741-8caf-cab46ad99869"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e1c6db42-8193-40ea-a8c3-ea94248c03da","children":["69a94fa9-90d7-4d8e-a930-63907412e6ff"]},"69a94fa9-90d7-4d8e-a930-63907412e6ff":{"id":"69a94fa9-90d7-4d8e-a930-63907412e6ff","message":{"id":"69a94fa9-90d7-4d8e-a930-63907412e6ff","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767759132.75788,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Examining and reformatting matrix proof","content":"User requested that we render the given proof nicely with LaTeX-style math.

Assume \\(A\\) is singular and build a chain of vectors\n\nAssume for contradiction that \\(A\\) is **not** invertible. Then \\(\\ker A\\neq\\{0\\}\\). Choose\n\\[\n0\\neq v_0\\in \\ker A,\\qquad Av_0=0,\n\\]\nand define\n\\[\nv_{k+1}:=Bv_k,\\qquad k=0,1,\\dots,n-2.\n\\]\nSo we obtain vectors \\(v_0,v_1,\\dots,v_{n-1}\\).\n\n#### Lemma 1.\nFor each \\(k=0,1,\\dots,n-2\\),\n\\[\nA v_{k+1}=v_k,\n\\]\nand for each \\(k=0,1,\\dots,n-1\\),\n\\[\nA^{k+1}v_k=0.\n\\]\n\n**Proof.** We prove by induction on \\(k\\) that \\(A^{k+1}v_k=0\\), and simultaneously obtain \\(A v_{k+1}=v_k\\).\n\n- **Base case \\(k=0\\).** By choice, \\(Av_0=0\\), so \\(A^{1}v_0=0\\). Also \\(A^{n-1}v_0=0\\). Apply \\(AB=BA^{n-1}+I\\) to \\(v_0\\):\n  \\[\n  ABv_0=BA^{n-1}v_0+v_0=0+v_0=v_0.\n  \\]\n  Since \\(v_1=Bv_0\\), this gives \\(Av_1=v_0\\), hence \\(A^2v_1=Av_0=0\\).\n\n- **Inductive step.** Assume \\(A^{k+1}v_k=0\\) for some \\(k\\le n-2\\). Then \\(A^{n-1}v_k=0\\) because \\(n-1\\ge k+1\\). Apply the relation to \\(v_k\\):\n  \\[\n  ABv_k=BA^{n-1}v_k+v_k=0+v_k=v_k.\n  \\]\n  With \\(v_{k+1}=Bv_k\\), we get \\(Av_{k+1}=v_k\\). Applying \\(A^{k+1}\\) to both sides yields\n  \\[\n  A^{k+2}v_{k+1}=A^{k+1}v_k=0,\n  \\]\n  i.e. \\(A^{(k+1)+1}v_{k+1}=0\\).\n\nThis proves the lemma. \\(\\square\\)\n\nIn particular, none of the \\(v_k\\) is zero: if \\(v_{k+1}=0\\), then \\(v_k=Av_{k+1}=0\\), forcing \\(v_0=0\\), impossible.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2. The chain is linearly independent\n\n#### Lemma 2.\nThe vectors \\(v_0,v_1,\\dots,v_{n-1}\\) are linearly independent.\n\n**Proof.** Suppose \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}c_k v_k=0\\). Apply \\(A^{n-1}\\). For \\(k\\le n-2\\), Lemma 1 implies \\(A^{n-1}v_k=0\\). Also,\n\\[\nA^{n-1}v_{n-1}=v_0\n\\]\nsince \\(Av_{n-1}=v_{n-2}, A^2v_{n-1}=v_{n-3},\\dots\\). Hence\n\\[\n0=A^{n-1}\\Bigl(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}c_k v_k\\Bigr)=c_{n-1}v_0,\n\\]\nso \\(c_{n-1}=0\\). Repeating with \\(A^{n-2},A^{n-3},\\dots,A\\) peels off the remaining coefficients and gives \\(c_{n-2}=\\cdots=c_0=0\\). \\(\\square\\)\n\nThus \\((v_0,\\dots,v_{n-1})\\) is a basis of \\(\\mathbb C^n\\). Fix this basis \\(\\mathcal B\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3. Matrix form in this basis\n\nIn \\(\\mathcal B\\),\n\\[\nAv_0=0,\\qquad Av_k=v_{k-1}\\ (k=1,\\dots,n-1),\n\\]\nso the matrix of \\(A\\) is\n\\[\nN=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nOne checks that \\(N^{n-1}=E_{1n}\\) (the matrix with a single \\(1\\) in position \\((1,n)\\)).\n\nLet \\(C\\) be the matrix of \\(B\\) in the same basis. Similarity invariance of the original identity gives\n\\[\nNC = C N^{n-1} + I = C E_{1n} + I.\n\\]\n\nNote that \\(CE_{1n}\\) has only the \\(n\\)-th column possibly nonzero, and that \\(n\\)-th column equals the first column of \\(C\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4. Entrywise contradiction\n\nWrite \\(C=(c_{ij})\\).\n\n**(i) First column.** Looking at the first column of \\(NC=CE_{1n}+I\\),\n\\[\nN\\,\\mathrm{col}_1(C)=\\mathrm{col}_1(I)=e_1.\n\\]\nSince \\(N(x_1,\\dots,x_n)^T=(x_2,\\dots,x_n,0)^T\\), this forces\n\\[\n(c_{21},c_{31},\\dots,c_{n1},0)^T=(1,0,\\dots,0)^T,\n\\]\nso in particular \\(c_{n1}=0\\) (here \\(n\\ge 3\\) ensures \\(c_{n1}\\) appears among those forced zeros).\n\n**(ii) \\((n,n)\\)-entry.** The last row of \\(N\\) is zero, hence \\((NC)_{nn}=0\\). On the right,\n\\[\n(CE_{1n})_{nn}=c_{n1},\\qquad I_{nn}=1,\n\\]\nso the \\((n,n)\\)-entry equation gives\n\\[\n0=c_{n1}+1 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad c_{n1}=-1.\n\\]\n\nThis contradicts \\(c_{n1}=0\\). Therefore the assumption that \\(A\\) is singular is impossible, so \\(A\\) is invertible. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n---\n\n## Accuracy check and critique\n\n- **Overall correctness:** The proof is correct. The key mechanism is: if \\(A\\) were singular, the given identity forces a length-\\(n\\) \u201cJordan chain\u201d \\(v_0,\\dots,v_{n-1}\\) that becomes a basis, making \\(A\\) similar to the single nilpotent Jordan block \\(N\\). In that basis, the transformed equation \\(NC=CE_{1n}+I\\) is shown to be inconsistent.\n\n- **Most delicate step (and it checks out):** In Lemma 1\u2019s inductive step, you *must* justify \\(A^{n-1}v_k=0\\) from \\(A^{k+1}v_k=0\\). This is valid because for the relevant range \\(k\\le n-2\\), we have \\(n-1\\ge k+1\\), hence\n  \\[\n  A^{n-1}v_k = A^{(n-1)-(k+1)}(A^{k+1}v_k)=0.\n  \\]\n\n- **Where \\(n\\ge 3\\) is used:** The \u201cfirst column\u201d computation forces \\(c_{n1}=0\\) only when \\(n\\ge 3\\) (because \\(c_{n1}\\) shows up among the forced zeros in that shifted vector). So the proof\u2019s dependence on the hypothesis \\(n\\ge 3\\) is genuine *for this argument*.  \n  Side note: for \\(n=2\\), the equation \\(AB=BA+I\\) is actually impossible anyway (trace of a commutator is \\(0\\), but \\(\\mathrm{tr}(I)=2\\)), so the conclusion would be vacuously true; for \\(n=1\\), there are counterexamples (e.g. \\(A=0,B=-1\\)).\n\n- **Minor editorial issues (not mathematical):**\n  - In the base case, the comment \u201c\\(H(1)\\) will follow\u2026\u201d is redundant because you already computed \\(A^2v_1=0\\) right there.\n  - Some steps can be tightened, but nothing is logically missing.\n\nIf you want, I can also suggest a shorter alternative proof (e.g. using trace/determinant identities or minimal polynomial arguments), but the one you have is solid."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"786a02c6-e499-4ed4-94b2-a5a5590553d9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"838adaf0-1d3a-4f52-b35d-fbd1bd2b8614","turn_exchange_id":"12f64ad0-fe48-4741-8caf-cab46ad99869"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"838adaf0-1d3a-4f52-b35d-fbd1bd2b8614","children":["9671c454-d28e-40fd-b9fa-50d0ba391ad5"]},"9671c454-d28e-40fd-b9fa-50d0ba391ad5":{"id":"9671c454-d28e-40fd-b9fa-50d0ba391ad5","message":{"id":"9671c454-d28e-40fd-b9fa-50d0ba391ad5","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767759993.996,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Sure, let's see your shorter / tighter alternative exposition."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"fc9c0dd3-11af-4c29-b648-568e6c52c2f3","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"fc76bdf0-9d04-476e-a556-8565bd780fd9"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c860abba-f2c7-4727-9658-6225568005f1","children":["17180494-874f-44c1-b2ee-53468beec4a3"]},"17180494-874f-44c1-b2ee-53468beec4a3":{"id":"17180494-874f-44c1-b2ee-53468beec4a3","message":{"id":"17180494-874f-44c1-b2ee-53468beec4a3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767759995.848703,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Providing a concise alternative to the proof","content":"User wants a more compact and efficient explanation.

Then \\(A^{n-1}v_k=0\\) since \\(n-1\\ge k+1\\).

Applying \\(A^{k+1}\\) gives\n  \\[\n  A^{k+2}v_{k+1}=A^{k+1}v_k=0,\n  \\]\n  i.e. \\(A^{(k+1)+1}v_{k+1}=0\\), completing the induction.\n\nSo we have, in particular,\n\\[\nA v_{k+1}=v_k\\qquad (k=0,1,\\dots,n-2).\n\\]\nIterating this \u201cshift\u201d gives\n\\[\nA^{n-1}v_{n-1}=v_0\n\\quad\\text{and more generally}\\quad\nA^m v_{m}=v_0\\ (m=1,\\dots,n-1).\n\\]\n\n### 2) The vectors \\(v_0,\\dots,v_{n-1}\\) are linearly independent\n\nSuppose \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k v_k=0\\). Apply \\(A^{n-1}\\).  \nFor \\(k\\le n-2\\), we have \\(A^{n-1}v_k=0\\) (since \\(A^{k+1}v_k=0\\) and \\(n-1\\ge k+1\\)), while \\(A^{n-1}v_{n-1}=v_0\\neq 0\\).
