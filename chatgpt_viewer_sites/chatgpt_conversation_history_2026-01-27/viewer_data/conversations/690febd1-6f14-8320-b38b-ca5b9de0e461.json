Our responsibility is to guide that power toward broad, lasting benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nListen to article\r\n7:41\r\nShare\r\nWhen the popular conception of the Turing test went whooshing by, many of us thought it was a little strange how much daily life just kept going. This was a milestone people had talked about for decades. It felt impossibly out of reach, then all of a sudden it felt close, then all of a sudden we were on the other side. We got some great new products and not much about the world changed, even though computers can now converse and think about hard problems.\r\n\r\nMost of the world still thinks about AI as chatbots and better search, but today, we have systems that can outperform the smartest humans at some of our most challenging intellectual competitions. Although AI systems are still spikey and face serious weaknesses, systems that can solve such hard problems seem more like 80% of the way to an AI researcher than 20% of the way. The gap between how most people are using AI and what AI is presently capable of is immense.\r\n\r\nAI systems that can discover new knowledge\u2014either autonomously, or by making people more effective\u2014are likely to have a significant impact on the world.\r\n\r\nIn just a few years, AI has gone from only being able to do tasks (in the realm of software engineering specifically) that a person can do in a few seconds to tasks that take a person more than an hour. We expect to have systems that can do tasks that take a person days or weeks soon; we do not know how to think about systems that can do tasks that would take a person centuries.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the cost per unit of a given level of intelligence has fallen steeply; 40x per year is a reasonable estimate over the last few years! \r\n\r\nIn 2026, we expect AI to be capable of making very small discoveries. In 2028 and beyond, we are pretty confident we will have systems that can make more significant discoveries (though we could of course be wrong, this is what our research progress appears to indicate).\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve long felt that AI progress plays out in surprising ways, and that society finds ways to co-evolve with the technology. Although we expect rapid and significant progress in AI capabilities in the next few years, we expect that day-to-day life will still feel surprisingly constant; the way we live has a lot of inertia even with much better tools.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we expect the future to provide new and hopefully better ways to live a fulfilling life, and for more people to experience such a life than do today. It is true that work will be different, the economic transition may be very difficult in some ways, and it is even possible that the fundamental socioeconomic contract will have to change. But in a world of widely-distributed abundance, people\u2019s lives can be much better than they are today.\r\n\r\nAI systems will help people understand their health, accelerate progress in fields like materials science, drug development, and climate modeling, and expand access to personalized education for students around the world. Demonstrating these kinds of tangible benefits helps build a shared vision of a world where AI can make life better, not just more efficient.\r\n\r\nOpenAI is deeply committed to safety\u2060, which we think of as the practice of enabling AI\u2019s positive impacts by mitigating the negative ones. Although the potential upsides are enormous, we treat the risks of superintelligent systems as potentially catastrophic and believe that empirically\u2060 studying\u2060 safety\u2060 and alignment\u2060 can help global decisions, like whether the whole field should slow development to more carefully study these systems as we get closer to systems capable of recursive self-improvement. Obviously, no one should deploy superintelligent systems without being able to robustly align and control them, and this requires more technical work. \r\n\r\nHere are several things we think could help with achieving a positive future with AI:\r\n\r\nShared standards and insights from the frontier labs. \r\nWe think that frontier labs should agree on shared safety principles and to share safety research\u2060, learnings about new risks, mechanisms to reduce race dynamics, and more. We can imagine ideas like frontier labs agreeing to certain standards around AI control evaluations being quite helpful.\r\n\r\nSociety went through a similar process to establish building codes and fire standards, which have saved countless lives.\r\n\r\nAn approach to public oversight and accountability commensurate with capabilities, and that promotes positive impacts from AI and mitigates the negative ones. \r\nThere are two schools of thought about AI. One is that AI is like \u201cnormal technology,\u201d in that it will progress like other technological revolutions in the past, from the printing press to the internet. Things will play out in ways that give people and society a chance to adapt, and conventional tools of public policy should work. We will need to prioritize ideas like promoting innovation, protecting the privacy of conversations with AI and defending against misuse of powerful systems by bad actors by partnering with the federal government.\r\n\r\nWe believe AI at around today\u2019s capability levels is roughly here, and should diffuse everywhere, which means most developers and open-source models, and almost all deployments of today\u2019s technology, should have minimal additional regulatory burdens relative to what already exists. It certainly should not have to face a 50-state patchwork\r\n\r\nThe other one is where superintelligence develops and diffuses in ways and at a speed humanity has not seen before. Here, we should do most of the things above, but we also will need to be more innovative. If the premise is that something like this will be difficult for society to adapt to in the \u201cnormal way,\u201d we should also not expect typical regulation to be able to do much either. In this case, we will probably need to work closely with the executive branch and related agencies of multiple countries (such as the various safety institutes) to coordinate well, particularly around areas such as mitigating AI applications to bioterrorism (and using AI to detect and prevent bioterrorism) and the implications of self-improving AI.\r\n\r\nThe high-order bit should be accountability to public institutions, but how we get there might have to differ from the past.\r\n\r\nBuilding an AI resilience ecosystem. \r\nIn either scenario, building out an AI resilience ecosystem will be essential. When the internet emerged, we didn\u2019t protect it with a single policy or company\u2014we built an entire field of cybersecurity: software, encryption protocols, standards, monitoring systems, emergency response teams etc. That ecosystem didn\u2019t eliminate risk, but it reduced it to a level society could live with, enabling people to trust digital infrastructure enough to build their lives and economies on it. We will need something analogous for AI, and there is a powerful role for national governments to play in promoting industrial policy to encourage this.\r\n\r\nOngoing reporting and measurement from the frontier labs and governments on the impacts of AI. \r\nUnderstanding how AI is concretely impacting the world makes it easier to steer this technology towards positive impact. Prediction is hard: for example, the impact of AI on jobs has been hard to anticipate, in part because today\u2019s AIs strengths and weaknesses are very different from those of humans. Measuring what\u2019s happening in practice is likely to be very informative.\r\n\r\nBuilding for individual empowerment. \r\nWe believe that adults should be able to use AI on their own terms, within broad bounds defined by society. We expect access to advanced AI to be a foundational utility in the coming years\u2014on par with electricity, clean water, or food. Ultimately, we think society should support making these tools widely available and that the north star should be helping empower people to achieve their goals."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"c832dfb9-d6b2-498e-8181-58cf7c73fb66","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"5ded8117-d1f1-4127-93fb-5b774d8362f2","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9204d928-2803-4edd-a352-6b09ea37732e","children":["50df3910-2d88-4f40-9e62-c0c43bdea4cd"]},"50df3910-2d88-4f40-9e62-c0c43bdea4cd":{"id":"50df3910-2d88-4f40-9e62-c0c43bdea4cd","message":{"id":"50df3910-2d88-4f40-9e62-c0c43bdea4cd","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762651090.354174,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"c832dfb9-d6b2-498e-8181-58cf7c73fb66","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"907808c0-38d0-4337-b584-031ab5130782","turn_exchange_id":"5ded8117-d1f1-4127-93fb-5b774d8362f2","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"907808c0-38d0-4337-b584-031ab5130782","children":["5875a88a-6ee7-4a3a-8739-5c5183b27d8e"]},"5875a88a-6ee7-4a3a-8739-5c5183b27d8e":{"id":"5875a88a-6ee7-4a3a-8739-5c5183b27d8e","message":{"id":"5875a88a-6ee7-4a3a-8739-5c5183b27d8e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762651090.70812,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"c832dfb9-d6b2-498e-8181-58cf7c73fb66","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"50df3910-2d88-4f40-9e62-c0c43bdea4cd","turn_exchange_id":"5ded8117-d1f1-4127-93fb-5b774d8362f2","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"50df3910-2d88-4f40-9e62-c0c43bdea4cd","children":["12c1bca0-4360-49f9-b7d8-c9398c003427"]},"12c1bca0-4360-49f9-b7d8-c9398c003427":{"id":"12c1bca0-4360-49f9-b7d8-c9398c003427","message":{"id":"12c1bca0-4360-49f9-b7d8-c9398c003427","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762651091.793271,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing AI timeline and policies","content":"It looks like I'll focus on the blog's key themes: AI discovery timelines (2026 small, 2028 significant changes), cost curve, and Turing test advancements.

In his blog post, he compared this drop in cost to Moore's law, highlighting the significant reduction in AI costs from GPT-4 in early 2023 to GPT-4o in mid-2024. Altman also noted that AI model intelligence correlates with the resources used for development and that continued investment will likely lead to super-exponential growth in AI intelligence. He predicted that this trend would significantly impact society, reducing the costs of many goods while increasing the prices of luxury items and limited resources like land. His comments follow a recent sell-off in AI-linked stocks due to DeepSeek's cheaper high-performance models. Despite this, major tech companies are increasing their AI investments, with collective expenditures set to surpass $320 billion. Additionally, Altman referenced the $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project announced by President Donald Trump, involving OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1739160917.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/sam-altman-teases-100-million-gpu-scale-for-openai-that-could-cost-usd3-trillion-chatgpt-maker-to-cross-well-over-1-million-by-end-of-year","title":"Sam Altman says OpenAI will own 'well over 1 million GPUs' by the end of the year - ChatGPT maker continues to expand rapidly","snippet":"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that the company is set to surpass 1 million GPUs online by the end of 2025, vastly exceeding the 200,000 used by competitors like xAI. This milestone underlines OpenAI's dominance in AI compute, and Altman has even hinted at future goals 100 times larger. Though jokingly framed, his ambition to reach 100 million GPUs\u2014costing $3 trillion at current rates\u2014is part of a broad strategy to scale toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This exponential growth has been driven in part by shortages of AI hardware like Nvidia's H100 chips, which previously delayed model rollouts.\n\nOpenAI has aggressively expanded its infrastructure, including a Texas data center consuming 300 MW and expected to hit 1 GW by mid-2026. Partnering with Microsoft and Oracle, and exploring alternatives like Google's TPUs, OpenAI is diversifying its computing ecosystem. The rapid growth and massive energy demands are drawing concerns from energy regulators, but Altman remains focused on long-term innovation, possibly including in-house chip development. While hitting 100 million GPUs isn't feasible yet, Altman's vision reflects a relentless pursuit of AGI and sets a new benchmark in the AI arms race.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1753138029.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/a169703c-c4df-46d6-a2d3-4184c74bbaf7","title":"OpenAI makes 5-year business plan to meet $1tn spending pledges","snippet":"OpenAI has developed a five-year business strategy to support over $1 trillion in spending commitments aimed at advancing world-class artificial intelligence. To meet these liabilities, the company is diversifying its revenue streams, forming new debt partnerships, and boosting fundraising. Key components include custom AI services for governments and enterprises, monetizing its video AI tool Sora and AI agents, launching consumer hardware alongside designer Jony Ive, and potentially entering online advertising. OpenAI is also exploring new infrastructure funding models and may offer computing resources via its Stargate data center initiative.\n\nThe company, with $13 billion in annual recurring revenue\u201470% from ChatGPT subscriptions\u2014has significant operational losses, such as $8 billion in H1 2025, though revenue doubled year-over-year. Only 5% of ChatGPT's 800 million users currently pay, a figure OpenAI aims to double. Partnerships with Oracle, AMD, and Nvidia include staggered capacity commitments and innovations in chip design. However, questions arise due to the immense future power demands and the circular nature of some funding deals. Despite these challenges, executives remain confident in achieving financial sustainability through rapid growth, cost reductions, and continued investor support.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1760500806.232,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_690febdd11a4832f89dcc10d96c5211a","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing

(They hint at \u201cAI control evaluations\u201d as a standard, but no specifics yet.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n4) **AI resilience**  \n- The analogy to cybersecurity is apt, but resilience requires *markets + mandates*: shared incident taxonomies, red-team clearinghouses, model/agent SBOMs, audit logs, kill-switch standards, and insurer-backed risk pricing. The Foundation\u2019s remit and funding suggest they\u2019ll try to catalyze this\u2014watch for grants and reference implementations. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201\n\n5) **\u201c80% of the way to an AI researcher\u201d**  \n- Framing, not a measured claim. On real research benchmarks, performance is spiky; robust autonomy still hinges on verification, tool use, and long-horizon planning. Treat the line as product-strategy rhetoric to push \u201cagentic\u201d use cases, not evidence that human-in-the-loop is obsolete. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Strategic implications\n\n**For labs & builders**\n- Expect **agentic systems** that run longer, chain tools, and tackle week-long tasks. Invest in task decomposition, credit assignment, and verifiability (traces, proofs, checks).  \n- The **compute posture** (AWS + existing partners) implies continued scale-ups; design for *multi-cloud portability* and *energy-aware* workloads to avoid concentration risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201\n\n**For enterprises**\n- If the \u201clight-touch\u201d lane holds, the next 12\u201324 months favor **broad rollout**: coders (Codex-style), knowledge work with \u201ccompany knowledge,\u201d and production voice/vision agents. The 1M-customer stat suggests mainstreaming\u2014budget and governance should follow. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n**For policy**\n- Start **Lane-B scaffolding now**: interagency safety institutes; standardized control evals; biothreat guardrails; cross-border incident response. Don\u2019t wait for the first major incident to define thresholds. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## What to watch next (concrete)\n- **Control evaluations:** any published test suite or third-party regime for \u201cAI control\u201d (the announcement points to this but lacks specs). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n- **Foundation grants/roadmaps** on AI resilience (who gets funded, what tools/standards they push). \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n- **Supply deals** beyond AWS (capacity, timelines, energy sources), and whether cost/perf improvements keep pace with the 40\u00d7 narrative. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201  \n- **Agentic product releases** tied to longer-horizon tasks (days\u2192weeks), and whether evals show reliability gains, not just demos. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## My take\n- This is **more than PR**: it triangulates OpenAI\u2019s technical direction (discovery-grade agents), operating constraints (compute), and governance ask (two lanes + resilience).  \n- The **big bet** is that economics (falling unit costs) will outpace new risks. If the cost curve stalls\u2014even temporarily\u2014policy, safety, and business adoption timelines change materially.  \n- The **open questions**\u2014trigger thresholds for Lane B, specifics of control evals, and independent verification\u2014will determine whether this plan scales without downstream shocks.\n\nIf you want, I can sketch an eval/verification stack for \u201cdiscovery-grade\u201d math/ML agents (benchmarks, proof-obligation structure, and traceable tool-use) that would be credible under the control-evaluation framing above."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":629,"end_idx":646,"safe_urls":["https://openai.com/index/ai-progress-and-recommendations/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/ai-progress-and-recommendations/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI
