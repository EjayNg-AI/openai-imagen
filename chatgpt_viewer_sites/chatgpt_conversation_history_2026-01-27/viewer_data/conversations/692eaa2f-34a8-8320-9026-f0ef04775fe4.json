What you want to do is:\n\n1. **Commit your changes locally**, and  \n2. **Point this local repo at a *new* GitHub repo under your account**, then  \n3. **Push to that new remote**.\n\nBelow is a clean way to do it from WSL.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Commit your changes locally\n\nIn WSL:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/that/repo\n\ngit status      # just to see what\u2019s changed\n```\n\nStage and commit:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Describe your changes\"\n```\n\nIf you already have commits, you can skip `git add/commit` unless there are new uncommitted changes.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Create a new empty repo on GitHub\n\nIn your browser:\n\n1. Go to GitHub \u2192 **New repository**.\n2. Set the **owner** to your account.\n3. Choose a name (say `my-new-project`).\n4. **Important:** Either:\n   - leave it completely empty (no README, no .gitignore, no license), or  \n   - if you *do* add files there, you\u2019ll have to pull/merge them later.\n\nClick **Create repository** and copy the repo URL, e.g.:\n\n- HTTPS: `https://github.com/your-username/my-new-project.git`  \n- or SSH:  `git@github.com:your-username/my-new-project.git`\n\n---\n\n## 3. Change the remote to point to *your* repo\n\nRight now, your local repo probably has:\n\n```bash\ngit remote -v\n# origin  https://github.com/someone-else/their-repo.git (fetch)\n# origin  https://github.com/someone-else/their-repo.git (push)\n```\n\nYou have two sensible options.\n\n### Option A \u2013 Keep original remote as \u201cupstream\u201d (recommended)\n\nThis preserves the connection in case you ever want to pull updates from the original repo:\n\n```bash\n# rename the current origin to upstream\ngit remote rename origin upstream\n\n# add your repo as the new origin\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-new-project.git\n\ngit remote -v\n# origin   https://github.com/your-username/my-new-project.git (fetch)\n# origin   https://github.com/your-username/my-new-project.git (push)\n# upstream https://github.com/someone-else/their-repo.git      (fetch)\n# upstream https://github.com/someone-else/their-repo.git      (push)\n```\n\n### Option B \u2013 Replace origin directly\n\nIf you don\u2019t care about keeping the old remote at all:\n\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/my-new-project.git\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Push your repo to GitHub\n\nCheck your branch name:\n\n```bash\ngit branch\n# * main   (or master or something else)\n```\n\nIf you want to standardize on `main`:\n\n```bash\ngit branch -M main\n```\n\nNow push:\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nAfter this, your modified project is fully hosted **as your own repo** on GitHub.\n\n---\n\n## 5. (Optional) If you *don\u2019t* want to keep the original history\n\nIf you want a \u201cfresh\u201d repo whose history starts from your current state (no commits from the original author):\n\n```bash\n# WARNING: this deletes all git history locally\nrm -rf .git\n\n# re-init as your own project\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-new-project.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nUse this only if you intentionally want to drop all past commits (e.g. to avoid mixing histories, or if you\u2019re effectively treating this as a new project).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Licensing & attribution (non-technical but important)\n\nDouble-check the original repo\u2019s **license**:\n\n- If it\u2019s MIT/Apache/BSD: you can usually reuse/modify as long as you keep the license and copyright notices.\n- If it\u2019s GPL: your derivative work must also be GPL if you distribute it.\n- If there is **no license**, you technically do **not** have the right to redistribute modified code publicly without permission from the author.\n\nAt minimum, keep the original LICENSE file (if present) and any copyright headers, and don\u2019t claim you wrote everything from scratch if you didn\u2019t.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n\n- the original repo\u2019s license, and  \n- whether you want to **preserve history** or **start fresh**,\n\nI can give you an exact, copy-paste sequence of commands tailored to your case."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"cb9643b6-f3f1-4327-ae07-1921b17496fb","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"8c2e1490-2edc-40bc-be9c-fbf40b1ad604","turn_exchange_id":"9bd2cf2c-728b-46c3-9c60-6219a88d5221"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"8c2e1490-2edc-40bc-be9c-fbf40b1ad604","children":[]}}}
