Similarly, the umbrella term non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was changed to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The renaming initiative began in 2020 and culminated in the adoption of new diagnostic criteria via the Delphi process. MASH, like NASH, describes liver inflammation and damage due to fat accumulation, but links it clearly to metabolic conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol, rather than excluding alcohol use. The transition has been widely accepted by medical societies and is being incorporated into coding systems and medical education. While there are challenges in adoption, especially among healthcare providers and the public, ongoing educational initiatives aim to address these.

Initially benign, excess fat in the liver can progress to MASH (formerly NASH), characterized by inflammation and liver cell damage, which may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. More critically, fatty liver is closely linked with cardiovascular disease\u2014the leading cause of death in these patients\u2014due to systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and hypertension.\n\nMoreover, fatty liver is tightly associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, creating a vicious cycle that exacerbates liver damage. It also increases the risk for chronic kidney disease and hormonal disorders such as PCOS and hypothyroidism. Despite affecting 25-30% of adults in Europe and the U.S.\u2014including many young adults\u2014diagnosis rates remain low.

Affecting about 5% of U.S. adults, MASH often has no symptoms but can lead to liver cirrhosis, increase diabetes and heart disease risk, and necessitate liver transplants in severe cases.\n\nFor years, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise were the only treatment. However, in a significant development, the FDA approved Rezdiffra (resmetirom) in 2024 as the first medication for MASH, designed to complement\u2014not replace\u2014lifestyle modification. Medical experts stress that losing just 5\u201310% of body weight through improved diet and regular exercise can dramatically reduce liver inflammation and potentially reverse early-stage damage.\n\nEmerging research also suggests that coffee may be beneficial, while alcohol should be avoided. Though early-stage MASH is sometimes reversible, advanced liver scarring is not. Gradual and sustainable lifestyle changes are encouraged for lasting health improvements.

MASH, formerly called NASH, is a progressive liver disease affecting approximately 15 million adults in the U.S. and is expected to contribute significantly to liver transplants by 2050. Wegovy becomes the second FDA-approved treatment for MASH fibrosis after Rezdiffra, which only addresses liver fat accumulation and damage.\n\nIn clinical trials, Wegovy demonstrated significant benefits: 63% of users saw full MASH resolution without worsening fibrosis, while 37% improved their fibrosis status. Unlike Rezdiffra, Wegovy also promotes weight loss and broader metabolic improvements. The approval is conditional, pending long-term trial outcomes expected in 2029.\n\nWegovy offers benefits even for non-overweight individuals, possibly due to its effects on hormone signaling and inflammation. However, patients are advised to maintain a reduced-calorie diet and regular physical activity. Experts stress that lifestyle changes remain essential, even alongside drug therapy.\n\nThe drug's broader GLP-1 class is being researched for other conditions, including kidney disease and Alzheimer's.

I\u2019ll use the newer names: NAFLD \u2192 MASLD; NASH \u2192 MASH. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n# What it can progress to\n\n**Inside the liver (hepatic outcomes)**  \n- **Fibrosis \u2192 cirrhosis \u2192 liver failure.** Disease stage (amount of fibrosis) is the main predictor of bad outcomes. On average, fibrosis advances **~1 stage every ~7 years in MASH** and **~1 stage every ~14 years in simple steatosis**, though progression is faster with diabetes and other risks. Cirrhosis (once present) decompensates in **~3\u201320%/yr**. All-cause mortality rises steeply with fibrosis stage. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n- **Even \u201cmild\u201d fatty liver isn\u2019t benign.** In a nationwide paired-biopsy cohort (median 3.4 y between biopsies), among those who started with **simple steatosis**: **12.5%** developed NASH, **18.3%** developed fibrosis, and **3.6%** reached cirrhosis by the next biopsy; progression\u2014*even just to first fibrosis*\u2014significantly raised end-stage liver disease events. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n- **Liver cancer (HCC).** Risk is highest once cirrhosis is present, but **HCC can occur without cirrhosis** in MASLD. Meta-analyses estimate **~0.03 per 100 person-years** in non-cirrhotic NAFLD (low *per-person* risk), yet **~1/3 of NAFLD-HCC cases lack cirrhosis** because the at-risk population is so large. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search2\ue202turn7search1\ue201\n\n**Outside the liver (extrahepatic outcomes)**  \n- **Cardiovascular disease (CVD).** CVD is the **leading cause of death** in MASLD; risk is elevated even with milder disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n- **Type 2 diabetes (incident).** MASLD roughly **doubles the risk** of developing T2D over time; risk is also high in *lean* MASLD. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search3\ue202turn8search15\ue201  \n- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD).** MASLD independently raises CKD risk; the risk increases with liver disease severity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \n- **Hypertension and arrhythmias.** Increased incident **hypertension (HR\u22481.66)** and higher risks of **atrial fibrillation** have been reported. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search0\ue202turn8search10\ue201  \n- **Malignancy (non-liver).** Elevated risks of **extrahepatic cancers** (e.g., GI, some hormone-related) have been documented at the population level. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search11\ue201\n\n# How risk is stratified (why \u201cmild\u201d still matters)\n- The **fibrosis stage** is the strongest single predictor of liver-related events and death; inflammation (MASH) and comorbidities (especially **T2D**) accelerate progression. In a multicenter biopsy study, diabetes increased the hazard of fibrosis progression by **~69%**. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n- That said, **progression from simple steatosis happens** in a meaningful minority within a few years, and even without fibrosis people with MASLD show *higher* risks for CVD and other extrahepatic outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue202turn12view0\ue201\n\n# Practical takeaways (non-diagnostic)\n- If you\u2019ve been told you have fatty liver, major societies recommend **non-invasive fibrosis risk stratification** (typically **FIB-4** first; elastography if indeterminate or high). Monitoring is more frequent if you have **T2D** or multiple metabolic risks. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n- Outcomes improve most by **addressing cardiometabolic risks** (weight, lipids, blood pressure, glucose), because they drive both **CVD** and liver progression. (Lifestyle change remains foundational; pharmacotherapy and procedures are adjuncts.) \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can help you compute a quick **FIB-4** from your age, AST, ALT, and platelet count and translate it into next steps per AASLD/EASL cutoffs. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search15\ue201","start_idx":179,"end_idx":212,"safe_urls":["https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10824973/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.aasld.org/new-masld-nomenclature?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([AASLD](https://www.aasld.org/new-masld-nomenclature?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10824973/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"New MASLD Nomenclature","url":"https://www.aasld.org/new-masld-nomenclature?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"New MASLD Nomenclature.

More than a third of U.S. adults suffer from metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The study involved 108 adults split into a time-restricted eating group and a control group. Those who followed the time-restricted eating schedule, eating at least one hour after waking and finishing three hours before bed, showed marked improvements in blood sugar levels, cholesterol profiles, BMI, and abdominal fat, compared to the control group.

Studies indicate that both methods can lead to similar short-term weight loss, though maintaining weight loss long-term remains challenging. Intermittent fasting focuses on meal timing, such as eating within an 8-hour window or following a 5:2 schedule, which can feel easier due to less emphasis on calorie counting. Some research highlights benefits like improved metabolic health and insulin sensitivity. A 2024 study found intermittent fasting led to greater weight and blood sugar improvements in people with Type 2 diabetes, although differences in calorie intake between groups may have influenced results. However, concerns exist, including a potential link between time-restricted eating and increased cardiovascular mortality, though more peer-reviewed research is needed. Skipping breakfast, often associated with this diet, may also raise cardiovascular risks. Side effects like hunger, headaches, and the impact on social life should be considered. For sustainable, heart-healthy eating, experts often recommend the Mediterranean diet, which provides weight and metabolic benefits with a focus on quality foods.

Effective management requires lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, exercise, and dietary changes.

Patients are advised to limit refined carbohydrates, sugars, high-fructose corn syrup, saturated fats, and processed foods. \n\nWeight loss, particularly gradual (1-2 pounds per week), can significantly improve liver health, reduce liver fat, and lessen associated cardiovascular risk factors. Some studies recommend lower carbohydrate, higher unsaturated fat diets for better liver function. \n\nA Mediterranean-style diet and other lower-carb diets show promise, but individual dietary needs may vary.

The liver plays a crucial role in detoxification, metabolism, and nutrient storage. To promote liver health, five beneficial drinks are highlighted:\n\n1. Coffee \u2013 Rich in antioxidants like chlorogenic acid, it may reduce inflammation and protect liver cells. Regular consumption (two cups daily) can lower risks of liver fibrosis and various liver diseases, including NAFLD and liver cancer.\n2. Green Tea \u2013 Contains catechins such as EGCG which prevent fat accumulation in the liver and support lipid metabolism. Moderate daily consumption is advised.\n3. Beetroot Juice \u2013 High in betalains and nitrates, it helps detoxify the liver and reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. A small occasional glass is beneficial.\n4. Tea \u2013 Black, oolong, and dark teas have protective effects against liver steatosis and inflammation while regulating gut microbiota. Limited intake (up to two cups) is recommended.\n5. Lemon Water \u2013 Rich in vitamin C and citrus flavonoids, it supports hydration and reduces oxidative stress. Drinking warm lemon water in the morning can aid liver detoxification.\n\nTo maximize these benefits, adopting a balanced diet and regular exercise is essential for overall liver well-being.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750836600.0,"attribution":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"time.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/4758402/protein-fatty-liver-disease/","title":"Why Eating More Protein Isn't Always Better","snippet":"A study presented at the International Liver Congress in Amsterdam highlights the risk of high animal protein diets leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), particularly in elderly and overweight individuals. About 3,400 people in the Netherlands, mostly overweight with an average age of 71, were examined. The study found that those who consumed the most animal protein were 50% more likely to develop fatty liver disease compared to those with lower animal protein intake. The association remained significant even when accounting for diabetes and high cholesterol, unlike with vegetable protein. Interestingly, high sugar diets did not increase fatty liver risk, possibly due to the antioxidant content from natural sugars. The study emphasizes that diet quality, particularly minimizing animal protein and integrating plant-based proteins such as beans and nuts, plays an essential role in managing liver health in overweight individuals.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1493401773.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b9bc8bdafc80079f828f0595d6da2d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for coffee and NAFLD evidence and guidelines","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a22c225ab03fc2-SYD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"c0a6655b-9305-4348-8d1b-233e3bd95a2b","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c0a6655b-9305-4348-8d1b-233e3bd95a2b","children":["e43dbbff-a672-4856-930a-0762375194c6"]},"e43dbbff-a672-4856-930a-0762375194c6":{"id":"e43dbbff-a672-4856-930a-0762375194c6","message":{"id":"e43dbbff-a672-4856-930a-0762375194c6","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757038081.63497,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"ADA Standards of Care 2025 nutrition therapy diabetes low carbohydrate mediterranean glycemic index recommendations section 5 'facilitating behavior change and well-being to improve health outcomes' \"}, {\"q\": \"ADA Standards of Care 2025 Medical Nutrition Therapy carbohydrate intake individualized low carb evidence remission\"}, {\"q\": \"EASD ADA consensus 2019 nutrition low carb mediterranean for T2D updated?\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"ADA Standards of Care 2025 nutrition therapy diabetes low carbohydrate mediterranean glycemic index recommendations section 5 'facilitating behavior change and well-being to improve health outcomes' "},{"type":"search","q":"ADA Standards of Care 2025 Medical Nutrition Therapy carbohydrate intake individualized low carb evidence remission"},{"type":"search","q":"EASD ADA consensus 2019 nutrition low carb mediterranean for T2D updated?"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching for ADA 2025 nutrition therapy guidelines","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a22c225ab03fc2-SYD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"089be835-9f0d-40f7-8a50-2dda4b5ff37b","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"089be835-9f0d-40f7-8a50-2dda4b5ff37b","children":["36af945c-3923-4533-bf8c-59d10c9bdbdf"]},"36af945c-3923-4533-bf8c-59d10c9bdbdf":{"id":"36af945c-3923-4533-bf8c-59d10c9bdbdf","message":{"id":"36af945c-3923-4533-bf8c-59d10c9bdbdf","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1757038086.813887,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"diabetesjournals.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S86/157563/5-Facilitating-Positive-Health-Behaviors-and-Well","title":"5.

Low-GI foods, which include meats, poultry, eggs, nuts, beans, and many fruits and vegetables, have minimal effect on blood sugar due to their low carbohydrate content or high levels of fiber and protein. These foods help slow digestion, maintain satiety, and reduce post-meal sugar spikes, making them beneficial for those with diabetes, obesity, or related health concerns. In contrast, high-GI foods like white bread and candy lead to rapid increases in blood sugar and are often low in nutrients. However, some nutritious foods like watermelon and potatoes have high GIs but still offer health benefits, underscoring the importance of considering overall nutritional value. The glycemic load (GL), which factors in GI and serving size, may provide a better assessment of a food\u2019s impact on blood sugar. A balanced diet that reduces refined carbohydrates and includes low-GI, fiber-rich foods is often recommended, with personalized guidance from healthcare professionals.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1699302600.0,"attribution":"www.health.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.eatingwell.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250","title":"Low-Glycemic Diet vs. Low-Carb Diet: Which Is Healthier?","snippet":"The low-glycemic diet and the low-carb diet are often confused but have distinct differences. A low-glycemic diet focuses on consuming foods with a glycemic index (GI) of 55 or less, which includes fruits, vegetables, beans, yogurt, and nuts while avoiding high-GI foods like baked goods and white rice. This diet helps maintain stable blood sugar levels, may aid in weight loss, improve energy levels, and reduce the risk of diabetes. However, it does not account for the overall nutritional value of food and emphasizes portion control, which can be challenging.\n\nThe low-carb diet limits carbohydrate intake to less than 26% of daily calories, or below 130 grams per day, to assist with weight loss and blood sugar management. Variations like the keto diet are more restrictive, potentially impacting overall health by limiting essential nutrients found in carb-rich foods.\n\nResearch suggests that the low-glycemic diet may offer more health benefits, including improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels, without being as restrictive. Conversely, very low-carb diets may negatively affect mood and heart health and are not sustainable long-term. It is important to consider personal nutritional needs and consult a dietitian before starting any diet.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1707169863.0,"attribution":"www.eatingwell.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.verywellhealth.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.verywellhealth.com/hyperglycemia-diet-5113343","title":"How to Control Hyperglycemia With Diet","snippet":"Hyperglycemia, or high blood glucose levels, can be managed or prevented through dietary adjustments, especially for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. It is important to balance carbohydrates with fiber intake, as fiber-rich carbs do not spike blood sugar levels as quickly. A low-glycemic index diet, which includes foods that are digested slowly, is helpful in maintaining stable blood sugar levels. Regular and balanced meals with consistent carbohydrate intake, along with pairing carbs with protein and fats, can help.\n\nStaying hydrated is also essential, as adequate water intake assists in blood glucose regulation. Incorporating soluble fibers and legumes, such as oats, beans, chickpeas, and lentils, can lower fasting blood glucose and improve insulin resistance. Fish and certain types of low-glycemic dairy, including unsweetened yogurt, are recommended, while garlic has been shown to lower glycemia and lipid levels.\n\nIndividuals should collaborate with their healthcare providers to develop personalized meal plans and monitor their diet to effectively manage hyperglycemia.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1615483971.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b9bc8bdafc80079f828f0595d6da2d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for fiber evidence in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a22c225ab03fc2-SYD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"3fe99827-1b4b-499f-9944-e277a5673aff","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3fe99827-1b4b-499f-9944-e277a5673aff","children":["df1d2026-4dfe-40b0-9920-5b1673dc810a"]},"df1d2026-4dfe-40b0-9920-5b1673dc810a":{"id":"df1d2026-4dfe-40b0-9920-5b1673dc810a","message":{"id":"df1d2026-4dfe-40b0-9920-5b1673dc810a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757038097.969543,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"AASLD guidance alcohol MASLD limit recommendation 2023 practice guidance\"}, {\"q\": \"EASL 2024 MASLD alcohol recommendation for NAFLD patients\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"AASLD guidance alcohol MASLD limit recommendation 2023 practice guidance"},{"type":"search","q":"EASL 2024 MASLD alcohol recommendation for NAFLD patients"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching guidelines for alcohol and MASLD recommendations","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a22c225ab03fc2-SYD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"726c4c40-4fbb-4cbf-8d6c-d63bc8842499","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"726c4c40-4fbb-4cbf-8d6c-d63bc8842499","children":["199cf4ce-1aa7-4532-a191-874711c12abd"]},"199cf4ce-1aa7-4532-a191-874711c12abd":{"id":"199cf4ce-1aa7-4532-a191-874711c12abd","message":{"id":"199cf4ce-1aa7-4532-a191-874711c12abd","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1757038101.008086,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.aasld.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aasld.org/practice-guidelines/clinical-assessment-and-management-metabolic-dysfunction-associated-steatotic","title":"Clinical Assessment and Management of Metabolic ...","snippet":"This AACE guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.aasld.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aasld.org/practice-guidelines","title":"Practice Guidelines","snippet":"AASLD's practice guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations and outline appropriate methods of treatment and care for clinicians.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.aasld.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aasld.org/practice-guidelines/alcohol-associated-liver-disease","title":"Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease","snippet":"AASLD develops evidence-based practice guidelines and practice guidances which are updated regularly by a multi-disciplinary panel of experts, including ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.aasld.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aasld.org/new-masld-nomenclature","title":"New MASLD Nomenclature","snippet":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) will now be metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

Calorie deficit is the lever, not a single \u201cmagic\u201d food. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- **Sugar-sweetened drinks:** cut to ~zero (SSBs drive liver fat and diabetes risk). Swap to water/unsweetened tea/coffee. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \n- **Alcohol:** avoid heavy use; if you ever have **\u2265F2 fibrosis** or uncertain stage, **abstain** (guideline-level recommendation). \ue200cite\ue202turn4search4\ue202turn4search1\ue201  \n- **Coffee (if tolerated):** up to **\u22653 cups/day** (caffeinated or decaf) is associated with **less fibrosis/HCC** in MASLD. Don\u2019t add sugar/syrups. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search3\ue201\n\n# 2) Pick one sustainable pattern (both are guideline-concordant)\n**A. Mediterranean-style (moderate-carb)**  \nWhole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit, nuts/seeds; fish 2\u20133\u00d7/wk; extra-virgin olive oil; minimal refined carbs/processed meat. Consistently improves liver fat and cardiometabolic risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search16\ue201\n\n**B. Lower-carbohydrate (\u2264130 g/day or 26\u201345% kcal; \u201cvery low\u201d <50 g/day)**  \nEmphasize non-starchy veg + protein + unsaturated fats; re-introduce carbs deliberately (berries, legumes, wholegrains) as glucose control allows. ADA recognizes low-carb as an effective option for A1C/weight; use if you want faster glycemic gains or med-reduction. Monitor LDL-C. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search14\ue201\n\n> Either pattern works **if** it creates a calorie deficit and is maintained. Choose by preference/adherence.\n\n# 3) Macro & food-quality rules (where MASLD + T2D overlap)\n- **Protein:** target **~1.0\u20131.5 g/kg/day** (higher end when dieting) unless you have CKD. Higher-protein diets reduce liver fat **even without weight loss** in T2D/MASLD (animal *or* plant protein both worked in trials). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- **Fat:** bias to **mono-/poly-unsaturated** (olive/canola/soy oils, nuts, seeds, avocado, fish). Keep sat-fat modest. Mediterranean evidence supports this shift. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n- **Carbs:** prioritize **low-GI/GL** sources (oats, legumes, wholegrain noodles, brown/basmati rice) and **fiber \u226530 g/day**; cut refined starches/sugars. Fiber supports weight/glucose control and likely helps MASLD. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\n# 4) Meal timing (optional lever)\nAn **8\u201310 h daytime eating window** can improve insulin sensitivity and blood pressure in early diabetes, independent of weight; use if it fits your lifestyle (don\u2019t force it). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n# 5) Singapore-specific, practical moves (hawker & home)\nUse **HPB \u201cMy Healthy Plate\u201d** as your base: **\u00bd plate non-starchy veg, \u00bc protein, \u00bc whole-grain carbs**.

Important Things to Know Before You Start Taking Creatine Monohydrate","snippet":"This article provides a comprehensive overview of creatine monohydrate, a popular and extensively studied supplement known for enhancing physical performance and offering various health benefits. Key points include:\n\n1. **Muscle Gains**: Creatine can boost strength and power by 5\u201315% by increasing phosphocreatine levels, aiding recovery, and improving workout efficiency.\n2. **Hormonal Influence**: It may affect anabolic hormones like testosterone and estrogen, although research results are mixed.\n3. **Water Retention**: Temporary water retention may occur in the early stages of supplementation.\n4. **Brain Health**: Creatine supports cognitive function and mental clarity, particularly during stressful periods, by increasing brain energy levels.\n5. **Exercise Performance**: Particularly effective for high-intensity and repetitive exercise, creatine may also aid endurance athletes by reducing muscle damage and fatigue.\n6. **Safety**: Long-term use (up to 5 years) appears safe with low risk of side effects, although more research is needed.\n7. **Affordability**: Creatine monohydrate is cost-effective at about 12 cents per gram.\n8. **Athletic Use**: Athletes benefit from creatine for performance and recovery; products should be third-party tested for safety.\n\nThe article emphasizes consulting healthcare professionals before starting supplementation and selecting reputable, certified products due to lack of FDA regulation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756920428.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-overdose-5219790","title":"What Are the Signs of Caffeine Overdose?","snippet":"Caffeine is a stimulant affecting the central nervous system and is widely consumed. Safe intake for healthy adults is up to 400 mg per day. Children under 12 should avoid caffeine, while teens should limit it to 100 mg daily. Pregnant women are advised to keep caffeine intake very low. Over 60 plants naturally contain caffeine, and it's also added to other products. Benefits include increased alertness and improved physical performance, but excessive consumption can lead to overdose. Symptoms of overdose include chills, flushing, headache, nausea, heart palpitations, and tremors. A lethal dose is 5-10 grams of caffeine. Accidental overdoses are rare but can occur with highly concentrated caffeine products. If overdose symptoms appear, contact Poison Control or call 911. Preventing overdose involves being aware of caffeine content in foods and medications and following dosage instructions for concentrated caffeine products carefully. Alternatives to caffeine include a nutritious diet, good sleep, and drinks like yerba mate and matcha.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1649790632.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/beetroot-juice-can-control-high-bp-finds-study-heres-how-to-prepare-this-healthy-drink-without-harming-your-kidneys/photostory/123673104.cms","title":"Beetroot juice can control high BP, finds study: Here's how to prepare this healthy drink without harming your kidneys","snippet":"Beetroot juice is gaining attention as a natural remedy for high blood pressure (hypertension), a condition affecting millions globally. Rich in dietary nitrates, beets help the body produce nitric oxide, which relaxes and dilates blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure. Clinical studies \u2014 including a 2022 meta-analysis \u2014 have shown that consuming beetroot juice can lower systolic blood pressure by 3.5 to 12 mmHg and diastolic pressure by 1.3 mmHg, especially in individuals with hypertension or cardiovascular risks.\n\nTo safely prepare beetroot juice at home and protect kidney health, experts recommend limiting intake to one glass (250 mL) daily, using fresh, cleaned beets, and combining them with lemon juice to reduce harmful byproducts. Those with kidney issues or at risk for stones should limit consumption to 2-3 times weekly, as beets contain oxalates that can strain kidneys. Adding apple, carrot, or ginger can enhance taste and digestion.\n\nBeyond blood pressure control, beetroot juice may enhance exercise performance, support heart and brain health, and aid digestion. However, moderation is key to avoid side effects like beeturia (red urine), stomach upset, or medication interactions.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756908000.0,"attribution":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277604/","title":"American College of Sports Medicine position stand. ...","snippet":"by MN Sawka \u00b7 2007 \u00b7 Cited by 3670 \u2014 Prehydrating with beverages, in addition to normal meals and fluid intake, should be initiated when needed at least several hours before the activity to enable ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33388079/","title":"International society of sports nutrition position stand","snippet":"by NS Guest \u00b7 2021 \u00b7 Cited by 837 \u2014 3.

It explains the difference between simple and complex carbs, noting that complex carbs, found in whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, provide a slow-release, sustainable energy source ideal for exercise. Pre-workout, it's recommended to consume complex carbs two to three hours ahead, with examples such as oats, whole-wheat bread, and beans. For a quick energy boost close to workout time, simple carbs like fruit smoothies, bananas, and crackers are advised. Post-workout, replenishing carbs and including 20 to 30 grams of protein within an hour is crucial for muscle recovery.

Sports dietitian Angie Asche advises that while consuming food before a run is not mandatory for everyone, it\u2019s crucial to experiment and find what works best for you. For shorter morning runs, it is recommended to have a balanced dinner the night before and a good breakfast afterward. If you prefer to eat pre-run, aim for a meal three to four hours beforehand or a carb-protein snack 30 to 60 minutes prior. Hydration is also essential, adjusting fluid intake based on temperature and humidity. Nutrient-dense foods like fruits, whole grains, and almonds offer beneficial antioxidants and vitamins. Avoid high-fiber and fried foods, as well as artificial sweeteners, which can cause stomach upset.

Experts recommend consuming a carbohydrate-rich meal 2 to 4 hours before exercise to supply energy, especially for morning workouts when glycogen levels are low. Complex carbs with a low to moderate glycemic index, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, are ideal. Including small amounts of protein 30 to 60 minutes before exercise can enhance fuel storage, muscle repair, and help prevent low blood sugar, particularly in female athletes. A carb-to-protein ratio of 3-to-1 is advised for pre-workout snacks. Fats should be avoided close to workouts since they digest slowly and may cause discomfort. For those needing a last-minute snack, a small piece of fresh fruit is effective. Timing is key\u2014eating too close or too far from workouts can result in bloating or hunger. Foods high in fat, protein, fiber, or sugar should be avoided pre-exercise to prevent digestive issues.

Safe intake for healthy adults is up to 400 mg per day. Children under 12 should avoid caffeine, while teens should limit it to 100 mg daily. Pregnant women are advised to keep caffeine intake very low. Over 60 plants naturally contain caffeine, and it's also added to other products. Benefits include increased alertness and improved physical performance, but excessive consumption can lead to overdose. Symptoms of overdose include chills, flushing, headache, nausea, heart palpitations, and tremors. A lethal dose is 5-10 grams of caffeine. Accidental overdoses are rare but can occur with highly concentrated caffeine products. If overdose symptoms appear, contact Poison Control or call 911. Preventing overdose involves being aware of caffeine content in foods and medications and following dosage instructions for concentrated caffeine products carefully.

The recommended safe limit is 400 milligrams per day, equivalent to around three cups of coffee, five ounces of espresso, or seven cups of black tea. Consuming more than this can lead to side effects such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, and headaches. Some people, including pregnant women, children, those with anxiety disorders, and individuals on certain medications, should limit or avoid caffeine. The source of caffeine, whether from natural or synthetic sources, generally does not affect its impact on health, though some beverages like matcha tea offer additional compounds that can moderate the effects. To minimize the risk of adverse effects, it is crucial to monitor caffeine intake and choose natural, low-sugar sources like coffee and tea.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1616619856.0,"attribution":"www.realsimple.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.eatingwell.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7948336/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-drink-caffeine/","title":"What Happens To Your Body When You Drink Caffeine","snippet":"Caffeine, consumed by many as a crucial part of their morning routine or to curb tiredness, does not actually provide superpowers. The FDA suggests a daily intake limit of 400 mg for healthy adults, and 200 mg for pregnant women. Caffeine increases alertness by blocking adenosine and releases adrenaline, causing a temporary energy boost. However, this can impede sleep quality if consumed in excess. It acts as a diuretic, promoting more frequent urination, but does not necessarily cause dehydration. Caffeine can temporarily enhance mood, though excessive intake could lead to anxiety and worsen certain health conditions, such as heart problems and diabetes. Physical dependence on caffeine is possible, and withdrawal can cause headaches and irritability. It may improve workout performance but is generally best consumed six hours before bedtime to prevent sleep disturbances. Moderate consumption is recommended to avoid potential negative effects.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1645556240.0,"attribution":"www.eatingwell.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.health.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.health.com/high-caffeine-consumption-heart-health-8701317","title":"Drinking This Many Cups of Coffee Each Day Could Put Your Heart Health at Risk","snippet":"Consuming more than 400 milligrams of caffeine daily, equivalent to around four cups of coffee, can negatively impact heart health. Research presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference showed that people who regularly exceeded this level had higher rates of cardiovascular disease, elevated heart rates, and increased blood pressure. Caffeine acts as a vasoconstrictor, narrowing blood vessels and raising blood pressure, and as a stimulant, it triggers the body's fight or flight response, causing short-term increases in heart rate and blood pressure. While moderate caffeine intake may have some health benefits, such as reduced risks of type 2 diabetes and dementia, excessive consumption increases the risk of heart issues, anxiety, and insomnia. Different caffeinated drinks, like energy drinks, also pose varying risks due to additional ingredients like sugars and nitric oxide. Experts recommend moderating caffeine consumption based on individual tolerance and health conditions.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1725645600.0,"attribution":"www.health.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b9bc8bdafc80079f828f0595d6da2d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching caffeine safety limits and guidelines","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a3aa64eb906bbe-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"35c5bc41-d8dc-4c96-9a30-a6cd0d113b80","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"35c5bc41-d8dc-4c96-9a30-a6cd0d113b80","children":["66384104-3f01-4faf-94cb-2da6cf76b6ad"]},"66384104-3f01-4faf-94cb-2da6cf76b6ad":{"id":"66384104-3f01-4faf-94cb-2da6cf76b6ad","message":{"id":"66384104-3f01-4faf-94cb-2da6cf76b6ad","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757053766.922571,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering data for supplements","content":"For caffeine, I\u2019ve found reliable sources including the FDA and ISSN position on caffeine.

For muscle growth, the International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends a loading phase of 0.3 g per kg of body weight taken four times daily for five to seven days, followed by a maintenance dose of 3\u20135 g daily. Larger individuals may require up to 10 g per day. Creatine monohydrate is the most studied and effective type due to its high bioavailability.\n\nCreatine helps produce energy by increasing phosphocreatine in muscles, which supports adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation, crucial during high-intensity workouts. While timing is still under study, taking creatine post-workout with carbs or protein may enhance absorption. Suggested benefits extend beyond fitness to possible improvements in conditions like diabetes, osteoporosis, and cognitive health.\n\nCreatine is generally safe at recommended doses, with rare side effects like gastrointestinal issues.

The most researched and recommended form, creatine monohydrate, can be effectively taken before or after exercise to maximize its benefits. Exercise augments blood flow, potentially increasing creatine absorption when consumed close to workout times. Evidence indicates that taking creatine post-exercise might improve muscle uptake due to enhanced blood flow and transponder activity during this period.\n\nIt is crucial to prioritize consistency in creatine supplementation, with doses typically ranging from an initial loading phase (20-25 grams per day divided into several doses for 5-7 days) followed by a maintenance phase (3-5 grams per day). For optimal results, taking creatine with carbohydrates or protein can enhance its uptake by muscles.\n\nWhile generally safe, creatine should be used with caution by individuals with certain medical conditions or those on specific medications due to potential side effects. Consultation with a healthcare provider is advised before beginning supplementation, especially for those with health concerns or taking other drugs.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1733494892.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2048496/","title":"International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand","snippet":"by TW Buford \u00b7 2007 \u00b7 Cited by 718 \u2014 The quickest method of increasing muscle creatine stores appears to be to consume ~0.3 grams/kg/day of creatine monohydrate for at least 3 days followed by 3\u20135 ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"jissn.biomedcentral.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z","title":"safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise ...","snippet":"by RB Kreider \u00b7 2017 \u00b7 Cited by 1485 \u2014 These studies show that short and long-term supplementation (up to 30 g/day for 5 years) is safe and well-tolerated in healthy individuals and ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"jissn.biomedcentral.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00412-w","title":"Common questions and misconceptions about creatine ...","snippet":"by J Antonio \u00b7 2021 \u00b7 Cited by 340 \u2014 Evidence-based research shows that creatine supplementation is relatively well tolerated, especially at recommended dosages (ie 3-5 g/day or 0.1 g/kg of body ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"jissn.biomedcentral.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23851411/","title":"Creatine supplementation","snippet":"by M Hall \u00b7 2013 \u00b7 Cited by 206 \u2014 The effective dosing for creatine supplementation includes loading with 0.3 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d for 5 to 7 days, followed by maintenance dosing at 0.03 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d most commonly ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28615996/","title":"safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, ...","snippet":"by RB Kreider \u00b7 2017 \u00b7 Cited by 1485 \u2014 International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.healthline.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/creatine-loading-phase","title":"What to Know About the Creatine Loading Phase","snippet":"Jun 10, 2024 \u2014 During the creatine loading phase, you take high doses of creatine for 5 to 7 days before moving on to lower maintenance doses.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1544601600.0,"attribution":"www.healthline.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.medicalnewstoday.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/creatine-loading-phase","title":"Creatine loading phase: Definition and how to","snippet":"Mar 21, 2025 \u2014 A creatine loading phase is when a person takes a higher dose than the maintenance level for several days.

Supplements containing caffeine or guarana may cause temporary spikes in blood pressure, which can be harmful in hypertensive individuals. Yohimbine, often used for weight loss and sexual health, increases norepinephrine, narrowing blood vessels and raising blood pressure. Ephedra, once popular for energy and performance, contains ephedrine alkaloids linked to heart attacks, strokes, and sudden death, and is banned in the U.S. for use in supplements.

It emphasizes understanding how different types of exercises, aerobic (running, cycling) and anaerobic (sprinting, weight lifting), affect blood glucose levels variably, and the importance of individual monitoring. Pre-exercise routines such as checking blood sugar levels, consuming appropriate carbohydrates, and adjusting insulin are crucial. Continuous glucose monitoring and regular checks during and after exercise are recommended to maintain optimal glucose levels. The article underscores the importance of working with healthcare professionals to tailor insulin adjustments and prevent hypoglycemia, especially following prolonged exercise sessions. It advises carrying fast-acting carbohydrates during runs and adjusting exercise timing to manage glucose sensitivity better.

Hypoglycemia is defined as blood sugar levels below 70 mg/dL and can cause symptoms such as shakiness, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, sweating, or headaches. Severe hypoglycemia (below 55 mg/dL) requires immediate attention, potentially needing a glucagon injection or nasal spray. Causes of hypoglycemia can include excessive insulin or diabetes medications, missed meals, alcohol consumption, or strenuous exercise. Routine blood sugar monitoring using blood glucose meters or continuous glucose monitors is crucial for managing levels. Emergency treatment for extremely low blood sugar involves ensuring others are knowledgeable about administering glucagon. Type 2 diabetes and hypoglycemia care require a supportive healthcare team and access to diabetes resources for education and assistance. Living with chronic hypoglycemia involves persistence and utilizing available resources, including support groups and medical apps. Frequent monitoring and correcting blood sugar levels promptly can prevent severe health impacts and improve overall quality of life.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1669733428.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b9bc8bdafc80079f828f0595d6da2d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching guidelines for exercise and blood glucose levels","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a3aa64eb906bbe-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"0edea9b7-7b94-43c2-b31c-4df46bc460dd","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0edea9b7-7b94-43c2-b31c-4df46bc460dd","children":["39fec412-a297-4979-8cbd-95eef87009cc"]},"39fec412-a297-4979-8cbd-95eef87009cc":{"id":"39fec412-a297-4979-8cbd-95eef87009cc","message":{"id":"39fec412-a297-4979-8cbd-95eef87009cc","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757053815.081693,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"GI fueling and electrolyte intake","content":"I don\u2019t necessarily need to dive too deeply into low vs. high GI fueling, but I can mention that pre-workout carbs should be easy to digest (low fiber, low fat) to avoid GI distress, using the ACSM 2016 guidelines.
