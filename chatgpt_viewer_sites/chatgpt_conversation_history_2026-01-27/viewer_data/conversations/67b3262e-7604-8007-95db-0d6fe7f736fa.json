Of course, the exact numbers can vary widely depending on curation standards (e.g. how many journal articles are included, how many textbooks, how many arXiv preprints, etc.), but this at least provides a ballpark estimate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Key Assumptions About GPT\u20112 Tokenization\n\n- **Typical token\u2010to\u2010word ratio**: In GPT\u20112 style tokenization, on average 1 token corresponds to roughly 0.75 words (or put another way, ~1.3 words per token).  \n- **Characters per token**: Often quoted as ~4\u20135 characters per token (including spaces and punctuation in practice).\n\nFor large corpora, it can help to think in terms of words or bytes, then convert to approximate token counts.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Sources for a Graduate\u2010Level Physics Corpus\n\nTo get an advanced graduate\u2010level understanding (covering core textbooks, specialized review articles, research papers, etc.), one might include:\n\n1. **Graduate\u2010level textbooks**  \n   - Typical advanced textbook: ~500\u2013700 pages.  \n   - Words per page can vary widely, but 500 words/page is a reasonable average.  \n   - So, a single 600\u2010page text might have ~300k words \u2192 ~400k tokens.  \n   - A small curated set of 50\u2013100 textbooks would add up to on the order of 20\u201340 million tokens.  \n   - Compared to modern large\u2010scale corpora, this is not huge; textbooks alone are a tiny fraction.\n\n2. **Research articles from major journals and arXiv**  \n   - A standard physics journal article might range from 3,000 words (short letter) to 10,000+ words (longer paper); arXiv papers often sit in the 5k\u201310k word range if you include references, captions, etc. Let\u2019s use 7k words as a middle ground.  \n   - **Number of articles**: \n     - Just on arXiv alone, there are over 2 million total submissions (all fields), with a large subset in physics.  \n     - If we take \\(\\sim 1\\,\\text{million}\\) physics\u2010related research papers (some fraction from arXiv + major journals), at 7k words each, that\u2019s \\(7 \\times 10^9\\) words in total.  \n     - Using the 0.75 ratio, \\(7 \\times 10^9\\) words \u2192 roughly \\(9.3 \\times 10^9\\) GPT\u20112 tokens.  \n   - If the corpus is expanded to 2\u20133 million relevant physics papers across decades (including classical, high energy, condensed matter, astrophysics, etc.), you could easily reach **tens of billions of tokens**.\n\n3. **Specialized review articles, lecture notes, conference proceedings, etc.**  \n   - These might add a few hundred million to a couple billion words/tokens if curated extensively.  \n   - Again, dwarfed by the scale of including 1\u20132 million research papers, but still nontrivial.\n\n4. **Supplementary materials and reference works** (e.g. extended appendices, data sets, \u201cfront matter\u201d from major collaboration docs):  \n   - Could add more text, but usually not more than a few percent of the total once you\u2019re already including so many research papers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Putting It All Together: Estimated Token Ranges\n\nBelow are broad \u201ctiers\u201d of how large a specialized corpus might get:\n\n1. **Minimal \u201ctextbook + select review\u201d approach**  \n   - ~100 textbooks + a few thousand review/landmark articles \u2192 on the order of hundreds of millions of tokens (e.g. 0.1\u20130.3 billion tokens).  \n   - This might be enough to cover standard graduate\u2010level coursework, but not truly comprehensive of the research front.\n\n2. **Heavy \u201call mainstream textbooks + large swaths of peer\u2010reviewed papers\u201d**  \n   - On the order of 1 million papers at ~7k words each \u2192 \\(\\sim 7 \\times 10^9\\) words \u2192 \\(\\sim 9 \\times 10^9\\) tokens.  \n   - Add textbooks, reviews, and other materials \u2192 somewhere in the **10\u201315 billion token** range.\n\n3. **Very comprehensive \u201carXiv + journals + everything else\u201d**  \n   - 2+ million articles (plus reviews, textbooks, conference proceedings, etc.) could push into the **20\u201340+ billion token** range, depending on the exact cutoff and how aggressively you scrape references, captions, and supplementary data.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical Considerations\n\n- In modern LLM training, billions of tokens are not unusual. Models like GPT\u20113 used hundreds of billions of tokens in total (across all domains). A specialized domain model dedicated to physics alone will obviously require far fewer tokens than a general\u2010purpose model trained on most of the web, but it can still reach tens of billions if one aims for *breadth* across the entire subfield.  \n- **Data quality > data quantity**: For specialized knowledge, curated, high\u2010quality data often matters more than raw size. Redundancies and poorly formatted conversions (e.g. from PDFs) can inflate token counts without truly increasing the model\u2019s conceptual grasp.  \n- **Recent advancements**: You\u2019d need to keep pulling the latest arXiv preprints, conference proceedings, etc. to stay up to date. The incremental addition each year will be a fraction of the total, but is non-negligible if you want coverage of cutting\u2010edge topics (particularly in areas like high\u2010energy theory or condensed matter, where hundreds of new preprints appear monthly).\n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line Estimate**\n\n- **A thorough, up\u2010to\u2010date \u201cgraduate\u2010level to frontier\u201d physics corpus** would likely land **anywhere from ~10 billion to ~30+ billion GPT\u20112 tokens** once you include a million or two research articles plus standard textbooks and reference works.  \n\nIn practice, you could build a smaller, highly curated ~1\u20135 billion token dataset (textbooks + major reviews + key papers) for more focused coverage\u2014but for truly comprehensive domain coverage (including many subfields and the most recent literature), tens of billions of tokens is a realistic ballpark figure."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"d847d46c-eeae-463d-b914-df1132165a79","request_id":"9135a6416c44f8d2-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d847d46c-eeae-463d-b914-df1132165a79","children":["73f1fb7b-a71c-47ae-8801-d737d9cb74d2"]},"73f1fb7b-a71c-47ae-8801-d737d9cb74d2":{"id":"73f1fb7b-a71c-47ae-8801-d737d9cb74d2","message":{"id":"73f1fb7b-a71c-47ae-8801-d737d9cb74d2","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739794254.598852,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["If we assume, say 10 billion tokens for physics, and multiply that across, say, 100 university disciplines ranging from chemistry to economics, would 1 trillion tokens be a reasonable estimate?

That is a **reasonable ballpark** if each discipline were covered as thoroughly as graduate\u2010level physics, *but* there are some important nuances to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Variation Between Disciplines**  \n   - Some fields have extensive written literature (e.g., biology, medicine) that may actually exceed physics in size.  \n   - Others (maybe smaller humanities subfields, or niche engineering specializations) may have fewer large\u2010scale research papers available.  \n   - So, while 10\u202fbillion tokens might be \u201ctypical\u201d for a robust graduate\u2010level coverage of physics, the actual token count per domain could be either smaller or much larger, depending on the discipline.\n\n2. **Overlap & Redundancy**  \n   - Disciplines are not fully distinct. Economics might overlap with math, statistics, or political science. Biology intersects with chemistry. So if you aggregated 100 domain\u2010specific corpora, some fraction would be duplicates or near\u2010duplicates (e.g., the same references, standard textbooks repeated or reprinted in multiple forms, etc.).  \n   - In a single, truly integrated corpus, you might not just blindly add up the token counts across all fields.\n\n3. **Excluding Foundational Data**  \n   - If you wanted to build a specialized model purely for each domain (and nothing else), 1\u202ftrillion tokens across 100 fields might suffice for domain *content* coverage.  \n   - **But** in practice, large language models also need extensive \u201cgeneral language\u201d data\u2014both for capturing the fundamentals of grammar, vocabulary, and style, and for domain\u2010general reasoning/mathematics that transcends a single field\u2019s research papers.  \n   - For instance, many domain texts presume the model can parse ordinary English (or another language) at a sophisticated level. You\u2019d typically want a large, broad corpus for that language foundation, plus additional curated sets for mathematical reasoning, general knowledge, coding examples, etc.\n\n4. **Modern Large\u2010Scale Pre\u2010Training**  \n   - State\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, GPT\u20104, etc.) often train on hundreds of billions to 1+\u202ftrillion tokens across *all sorts* of web data, books, code, Wikipedia, news, etc.  \n   - The idea is that **breadth** is just as important as depth in one field. Real\u2010world user queries often require bridging multiple areas of knowledge.  \n   - A specialized domain model might not need quite so large a corpus if it\u2019s only meant to handle narrower topics. But once you scale up to 100 disciplines, you\u2019re effectively covering a broad swath of human knowledge\u2014so you\u2019re back into \u201cmassive corpus\u201d territory anyway.\n\n#### Bottom Line\n\n- **1\u202ftrillion tokens** is a **plausible** order\u2010of\u2010magnitude figure if each of 100 domains is collected at the ~10\u202fbillion\u2010token scale.  \n- **Yes**, that 1\u202ftrillion would specifically cover domain\u2010focused texts, and it **excludes** the large amount of general\u2010purpose language/mathematics data typically used to learn grammar, syntax, basic math, etc.  \n- In practice, building a truly comprehensive model often involves both:  \n  1. **A broad \u201cfoundation\u201d corpus** of hundreds of billions to a trillion+ tokens covering general language and domain\u2010general reasoning.  \n  2. **An additional specialized \u201cexpert\u201d corpus** for each advanced topic.\n\nHence, if you wanted robust coverage of 100 graduate\u2010level fields *plus* top\u2010tier language fundamentals, you\u2019d likely exceed 1\u202ftrillion tokens in total."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"22d0b5cf-b8fb-4f84-b11a-3a8fbe17b92b","request_id":"9135ad488d56f8d2-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"22d0b5cf-b8fb-4f84-b11a-3a8fbe17b92b","children":["2b1cb12f-68b1-42a3-89a1-58e7fb63b86e"]},"2b1cb12f-68b1-42a3-89a1-58e7fb63b86e":{"id":"2b1cb12f-68b1-42a3-89a1-58e7fb63b86e","message":{"id":"2b1cb12f-68b1-42a3-89a1-58e7fb63b86e","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739794606.441688,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Excluding graduate level academic knowledge, which we place very approximately at 1 trillion tokens, estimate how many tokens would be dedicated toward building knowledge of multiple languages (say 100 different languages, but focussed on English as the top priority), current events, real world knowhow, etc?

Reference Points from Known Large Corpora\n\n1. **GPT\u20113 \u201cCommon Crawl + others\u201d**  \n   - Trained on \\(\\sim 300\\)\u202fbillion tokens total (estimates vary), which was primarily English web text plus a smaller share of other languages.  \n   - Not fully up to date on current events beyond 2019\u20132020, and it did not place heavy emphasis on large multilingual coverage.\n\n2. **LLaMA** (Meta, 2023)  \n   - Used a **1.4\u202ftrillion\u2010token** training dataset spanning multiple languages (though skewed toward English), academic papers, code, etc.  \n   - One of the largest well\u2010documented open\u2010source LLM corpora to date.\n\n3. **GPT\u20114** (OpenAI, rumored)  \n   - Specific training details are not public, but it is widely believed that GPT\u20114 was fed **trillions** of tokens, with coverage in many languages.  \n\nFrom these examples, the **lower bound** on a modern broad \u201cfoundation\u201d corpus is already in the hundreds of billions of tokens, often crossing into the trillion\u2010token range when we want strong multilingual coverage and \u201creal\u2010world\u201d breadth (i.e. news, Wikipedia, web data, code, social media, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Estimating a Dedicated \u201cMultilingual + Real\u2010World Knowledge\u201d Corpus\n\nIf you exclude advanced academic texts (the hypothetical 1\u202ftrillion tokens devoted to graduate\u2010level content), you still need to account for a massive amount of:\n\n1. **General English Text**  \n   - English typically dominates Internet text. Even just the Common Crawl or a curated subset can yield **hundreds of billions** of English tokens.  \n   - For example, you might see 300\u2013500\u202fbillion tokens from a curated English subset alone.\n\n2. **Other Major Languages**  \n   - Worldwide, ~10\u201320 major languages (Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, French, German, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, etc.) each have substantial online text\u2014though typically less than English.  \n   - You could easily gather on the order of tens of billions of tokens *per large language*, adding up to **another few hundred billion** total if you aim for good coverage.  \n\n3. **Long\u2010Tail Languages**  \n   - If you truly want some coverage for 100+ languages, many of these corpora are smaller and sparser (especially for low\u2010resource or \u201clong\u2010tail\u201d languages).  \n   - You might have anywhere from a few million to a few hundred million tokens available per language. Summed across many languages, that might still add up to tens of billions more.  \n   - The total for these smaller languages will be **much** less than top\u2010tier languages, but still a nontrivial fraction if you do a broad scrape.\n\n4. **Current Events & Real\u2010World Knowhow**  \n   - A portion of the data is typically from news sources, social media, Wikipedia updates, plus specialized websites.  \n   - To keep it \u201cfresh,\u201d LLM pipelines sometimes re\u2010crawl large websites or continuously feed in news and discussion. Over time, this might add up to billions of tokens per year.  \n   - Even a single year of major news + social media could easily reach **dozens of billions** of tokens if you keep significant volume.  \n\n### Putting It All Together\n\n- **English foundation**: ~300\u2013500+\u202fbillion tokens  \n- **Top ~10\u201320 major languages**: ~100\u2013300+\u202fbillion tokens collectively  \n- **Long\u2010tail 80+ languages**: ~10\u201350+\u202fbillion tokens collectively  \n- **Ongoing news, events, real\u2010world sources**: tens of billions per year (variable)\n\nWhen summed, it is easy to **reach or exceed 1\u202ftrillion tokens** for a robust multilingual, real\u2010world corpus.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Broad Ballpark Figures\n\n- **Minimal \u201cbroad coverage\u201d** (English\u2010centric + moderate coverage for major languages + some real\u2010world data):  \n  \\(\\sim 0.5\\)\u20131\u202ftrillion tokens  \n- **Heavily multilingual, more comprehensive, regularly updated** (covering 100+ languages, large news ingestion, real\u2010world discussions, etc.):  \n  \\(\\sim 1\\)\u20132+\u202ftrillion tokens  \n\nThis **excludes** your separate 1\u202ftrillion tokens of advanced academic material\u2014so in total, you could be looking at **2+\u202ftrillion tokens** if you combine them into one comprehensive training set.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary\n\n- A 1\u202ftrillion\u2010token corpus for graduate\u2010level academic knowledge is quite large on its own.  \n- **Building robust language coverage (100+ languages), current events, and real\u2010world text** would plausibly **add another 1+ trillion tokens**, depending on how comprehensive and up\u2010to\u2010date you want to be.  \n- In practice, modern foundation models often end up in the **1\u20132+ trillion total token** range just for general coverage\u2014so combining that with a separate trillion in specialized academic texts could easily push beyond **2 trillion tokens** overall."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"5040ec68-8897-47b6-a003-f152133678d1","request_id":"9135b5df4e073fbc-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5040ec68-8897-47b6-a003-f152133678d1","children":["15119894-e184-4a30-96f0-6dd148ea602a"]},"15119894-e184-4a30-96f0-6dd148ea602a":{"id":"15119894-e184-4a30-96f0-6dd148ea602a","message":{"id":"15119894-e184-4a30-96f0-6dd148ea602a","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739794918.554664,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["So plausibly, the data needed to train a sophisticated frontier LLM could fit on a large enterprise grade hard drive?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"9135bd7e989f3fbc-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cae0b2ec-c3af-4be6-b8ac-7f8768bda89f","children":["1b674ba8-47ca-4411-bc18-5730f39e9497"]},"1b674ba8-47ca-4411-bc18-5730f39e9497":{"id":"1b674ba8-47ca-4411-bc18-5730f39e9497","message":{"id":"1b674ba8-47ca-4411-bc18-5730f39e9497","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1739795070.565015,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Assessing data capacity**\n\nI'm evaluating the feasibility of a sophisticated large language model with 2 trillion tokens fitting on an enterprise-grade hard drive, considering token size and compression.\n\n**Weighing data scale**\n\nOK, let me see.

Modern high\u2010capacity drives can reach 20\u202fTB\u201330\u202fTB (and are trending higher). Even a 2\u2011trillion\u2010token corpus will typically measure in the single\u2010digit terabytes to perhaps a couple dozen terabytes when stored as text or tokenized binary data (especially if compressed). That is well within the capacity of a single 20\u202fTB or 30\u202fTB drive.\n\n---\n\n### Why the Data Size Isn\u2019t the Bottleneck\n\n1. **Tokens \u2192 Terabytes**  \n   - Roughly, each token in GPT\u2011style text corresponds to ~4 characters on average.  \n   - So 2\u202ftrillion tokens \\(\\times\\) 4\u202fcharacters/token = ~8\u202ftrillion characters = ~8\u202fTB uncompressed (assuming 1\u202fbyte/character).  \n   - With compression or more compact representations, this can easily dip to a few terabytes total.\n\n2. **Practical \u201cFrontier LLM\u201d Scale**  \n   - Real\u2010world large\u2010scale corpora can indeed run into the single\u2010digit or low double\u2010digit terabytes. Even training on 5\u201310\u202ftrillion tokens would likely remain within 20\u201340\u202fTB of uncompressed text.  \n   - This is physically storable on a single enterprise\u2010grade disk (though in practice, data centers often keep multiple copies for redundancy or parallel streaming).\n\n3. **Compute Is the Real Challenge**  \n   - Although data can fit on one big drive, training an LLM across trillions of tokens typically demands **massive GPU clusters** (or TPU pods) running for weeks to months.  \n   - The cost and complexity of the distributed compute, networking, and optimization dwarfs the mere cost or feasibility of storing those terabytes of text.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Yes**, from a purely **physical storage** standpoint, even a trillion\u2010token dataset (or a few trillion) can feasibly reside on **one** high\u2010capacity hard drive.  \n- The **bigger challenge** isn\u2019t where to store the text, but how to efficiently process/traverse it at scale\u2014requiring substantial distributed compute infrastructure and engineering."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"1b674ba8-47ca-4411-bc18-5730f39e9497","request_id":"9135bd7e989f3fbc-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1b674ba8-47ca-4411-bc18-5730f39e9497","children":[]}}}
