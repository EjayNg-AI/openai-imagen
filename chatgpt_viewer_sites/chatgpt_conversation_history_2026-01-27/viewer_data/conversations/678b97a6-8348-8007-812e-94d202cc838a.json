Here are my comments:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Strengths of the Framework**\n- **Clarity of Categorization**: The framework breaks down AI progress into five levels (No AI, Emerging, Competent, Expert, Virtuoso, and Superhuman) and distinguishes between narrow AI (task-specific) and general AI (adaptable across tasks). This provides a clear roadmap for understanding AI advancements.\n- **Integration of Examples**: Including real-world examples like ChatGPT, AlphaZero, and Grammarly helps ground the discussion in practical applications.\n- **Highlighting Unachieved Goals**: It explicitly indicates that certain milestones, such as \"Expert AGI,\" \"Virtuoso AGI,\" and \"ASI,\" have not yet been achieved. This reinforces the notion that general AI remains a distant and speculative goal.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Key Observations**\n- **Dominance of Narrow AI**: The table emphasizes that all existing AI systems are narrow, focusing on specific tasks like natural language processing (ChatGPT) or gameplay (AlphaZero). Even the most advanced systems, like AlphaFold, are far from achieving general intelligence.\n- **Emerging AGI Examples Are Questionable**: Llama 2, ChatGPT, and Bard are categorized under \"Emerging AGI.\" This is debatable, as these systems are still very much narrow AI, albeit with broad applications within natural language tasks. They lack true general intelligence or the ability to learn and adapt like humans.\n- **Gap Between Narrow AI and AGI**: The absence of achieved milestones under \"Competent AGI,\" \"Expert AGI,\" or higher levels in the general category highlights the immense challenges in developing AGI. Even though narrow AI is advancing rapidly, general AI progress remains speculative.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Limitations and Critiques**\n- **Overgeneralization of Performance Levels**: \n  - The performance levels (e.g., \"Emerging,\" \"Competent\") are somewhat subjective and not clearly defined. What qualifies as \"50th percentile of skilled adults\" or \"90th percentile\"? These thresholds are ambiguous and open to interpretation.\n  - AI performance can vary significantly across tasks, making a single performance label for each AI system potentially misleading.\n- **Placement of Examples**:\n  - Some placements seem questionable. For instance, toxicity detectors like Jigsaw (Competent Narrow AI) may not be at the same performance level as GPT-based systems like PaLI.\n  - DALL-E 2 (Expert Narrow AI) might arguably be closer to \"Competent Narrow AI\" since its image generation capabilities are impressive but not consistently human-like in quality.\n- **Neglect of Safety Concerns**: The framework does not touch on the ethical or safety challenges of moving from narrow AI to AGI and beyond. These considerations are crucial when discussing AI progression.\n- **Speculation at Higher Levels**: The table presumes a linear path to AGI and ASI, but these transitions may involve paradigm shifts or breakthroughs that are not reflected here.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Implications for the AI Landscape**\n- **Focus on Narrow AI Progress**: The dominance of narrow AI across performance levels demonstrates that most AI development today is task-specific. This is likely to remain the trend for the foreseeable future.\n- **Long Road to AGI**: The absence of achieved milestones in the \"General\" column is a stark reminder of how far AGI remains. While systems like ChatGPT are impressive, their abilities are still fundamentally narrow.\n- **Potential Overhype of Current Systems**: Including systems like ChatGPT in the \"Emerging AGI\" category might unintentionally overhype their generalization abilities. This could mislead the public about the true state of AI development.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **What\u2019s Missing?**\n- **Hybrid Systems**: Many AI systems are moving towards hybrid architectures that combine elements of narrow AI with adaptability (e.g., combining LLMs with external tools or APIs). These aren't explicitly captured here.\n- **Focus on Real-World Impacts**: The table doesn't address the societal implications of AI performance levels. For example, even \"Competent Narrow AI\" systems like toxicity detectors have a disproportionate influence on online content moderation.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Concluding Thoughts**\nThis table provides a useful high-level overview of AI progress, especially in the narrow vs. general dichotomy. However, it simplifies the complexity of AI development and risks overstating the proximity of AGI. The linear progression it implies may not align with the unpredictable and non-linear nature of technological breakthroughs. Furthermore, real-world challenges like ethics, safety, and regulation deserve a place in such discussions. \n\nGoogle's framing here might reflect a desire to contextualize recent breakthroughs while setting expectations for AGI development\u2014reinforcing the reality that true general intelligence remains an aspirational goal, not an imminent reality."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa23e97-43d9-4920-821f-77ac111003c8","request_id":"903e6c4d2f8bf91c-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa23e97-43d9-4920-821f-77ac111003c8","children":[]}}}
