This new model claims top performance on common AI benchmarks, surpassing competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and DeepSeek. Available in Google AI Studio and for Gemini Advanced subscribers, it showcases advancements in understanding, mathematics, coding, and multi-modal capabilities, such as interpreting text, audio, still images, video, and code. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis highlighted its substantial improvements across various domains, boasting a 39 ELO point lead on LMArena. The Gemini 2.5 Pro model emphasizes \"reasoning\" abilities, enabling it to process tasks step-by-step and deliver more informed and accurate responses, particularly for complex prompts. A demo video illustrates the AI's capacity to program a video game from a single prompt, showcasing these refined reasoning skills. The forthcoming update will also expand the model's context window to 2 million tokens for handling more extensive data.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1742939857.0,"attribution":"The Verge"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_681ab55e8f788007a8ae0eb10e56c64a","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"6844e3e3-04ee-4305-84d7-99a37c8f09b2","request_id":"93bce4a9ffbbf44c-SEA","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6844e3e3-04ee-4305-84d7-99a37c8f09b2","children":["8f9d74b3-c81e-4438-aaec-628f6074f305"]},"8f9d74b3-c81e-4438-aaec-628f6074f305":{"id":"8f9d74b3-c81e-4438-aaec-628f6074f305","message":{"id":"8f9d74b3-c81e-4438-aaec-628f6074f305","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1746580874.785848,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering resources","content":"I\u2019m thinking I should definitely check out the VentureBeat article about thinking budgets to get some insights.

(Preview channel notes)|\n|Android XR (Project Moohan)|On-device reasoning for spatial interfaces; cloud Pro fallback. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue201|\n\n## 8  Limitations & open questions  \n\n* **Opacity**: Google has still not released a technical report with parameter counts or training-data schema, limiting external reproducibility.  \n* **Token billing surprise**: Early testers note reasoning can exceed the set budget on complex prompts, inflating cost predictability (bug filed 2 May).  \n* **Latency on 2 M-token context**: Google warns high latency until further optimization. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search0\ue201  \n* **Benchmark cherry-picking**: Most public wins exclude tool-use or chain-of-majority-vote, whereas GPT-4o\u2019s latest scores include those tricks. Independent head-to-heads are still sparse.  \n* **Safety scalability**: Frontier Safety Framework is new; its effectiveness in production remains to be audited by third parties. \ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue201  \n\n## 9  Competitive landscape outlook  \n\nGemini 2.5\u2019s reasoning leap and cost granularity narrow the gap with GPT-4-family models while out-pricing Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 and xAI\u2019s Grok-1.5 at equivalent accuracy. Whether 2 M-token context and upcoming Veo-integrated video generation can keep Google in pole position will depend on real-world latency, trust, and developer tooling\u2014areas OpenAI and Microsoft continue to harden.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Gemini 2.5 elevates Google\u2019s LLM stack from \u201cmultimodal at parity\u201d to \u201cmultimodal + native reasoning and cost-tunable,\u201d carving a distinct value proposition for enterprises that need controllable budgets and million-token contexts without ceding benchmark leadership."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201","start_idx":780,"end_idx":797,"safe_urls":["https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([blog.google](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gemini 2.5: Our newest Gemini model with thinking","url":"https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"blog.google"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201","start_idx":900,"end_idx":917,"safe_urls":["https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-gemini-2-5-flash-introduces-thinking-budgets-that-cut-ai-costs-by-600-when-turned-down/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-gemini-2-5-flash-introduces-thinking-budgets-that-cut-ai-costs-by-600-when-turned-down/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash introduces 'thinking budgets' that cut AI costs by 600% when turned down | VentureBeat","url":"https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-gemini-2-5-flash-introduces-thinking-budgets-that-cut-ai-costs-by-600-when-turned-down/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"VentureBeat"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":1034,"end_idx":1051,"safe_urls":["https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/google-debuts-an-updated-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-model-ahead-of-i-o/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/google-debuts-an-updated-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-model-ahead-of-i-o/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Google debuts an updated Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model ahead of I/O | TechCrunch","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/google-debuts-an-updated-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-model-ahead-of-i-o/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"TechCrunch"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn5search3\ue201","start_idx":1160,"end_idx":1192,"safe_urls":["https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://io.google/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Google I/O](https://io.google/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Google I/O](https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Google I/O 2025","url":"https://io.google/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Developer keynote.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis highlighted its substantial improvements across various domains, boasting a 39 ELO point lead on LMArena. The Gemini 2.5 Pro model emphasizes \"reasoning\" abilities, enabling it to process tasks step-by-step and deliver more informed and accurate responses, particularly for complex prompts.
