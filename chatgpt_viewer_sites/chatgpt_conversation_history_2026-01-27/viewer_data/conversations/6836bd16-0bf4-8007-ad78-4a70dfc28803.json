Go to: https://miktex.org/download\n2. Download the **\"Net Installer\"** for Windows.\n3. Run the installer as administrator.\n4. Choose:\n   - **Install for all users** (unless you're the only user).\n   - Preferred paper size: A4.\n   - **Yes** to installing packages on-the-fly (useful for missing packages).\n5. Let the installation complete.\n6. Open **MiKTeX Console**, go to *\"Updates\"* and install any pending updates.\n\n#### Option B: **TeX Live**\n1. Download installer from: https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html\n2. This is more comprehensive but larger in size (~4+ GB).\n3. Run the installer and follow the default configuration.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Use **MiKTeX** if you're on a slower connection or want a lightweight setup with on-demand package installs.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf4e macOS\n\n1. Install **MacTeX**: https://tug.org/mactex/\n2. Download the full `.pkg` installer (~4GB).\n3. Run the installer and follow instructions.\n4. After installation, binaries are in `/Library/TeX/texbin`, and paths are set automatically.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc27 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)\n\nRun the following in terminal:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install texlive-full\n```\n\n> `texlive-full` installs everything. If you want a minimal setup, use `texlive` or `texlive-base`, but you might need to install missing packages manually later.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Step 2: Install TeXstudio\n\n### Windows/macOS\n\n1. Download from: https://www.texstudio.org/\n2. Choose your platform (Windows .exe / macOS .dmg).\n3. Install as usual.\n4. On first launch:\n   - TeXstudio may ask you to specify the path to `pdflatex`. Usually, it detects it automatically (especially if you installed MiKTeX or MacTeX properly).\n   - You can verify/set it in:\n     - `Options` \u2192 `Configure TeXstudio` \u2192 `Commands`\n     - `pdflatex` should point to something like:  \n       - Windows: `C:/Program Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64/pdflatex.exe`\n       - macOS: `/Library/TeX/texbin/pdflatex`\n\n### Linux\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install texstudio\n```\n\nOr use `snap`:\n```bash\nsudo snap install texstudio\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step 3: Verify Everything Works\n\n1. Launch **TeXstudio**.\n2. Create a new file with the following content:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\nHello, \\LaTeX!\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n3. Save it as `test.tex`.\n4. Click the **\"Build & View\"** button (F5 or green play triangle).\n5. A PDF should be generated.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 Optional: Keep Everything Updated\n\n- **MiKTeX Console** \u2192 Check for updates regularly.\n- **TeXstudio** \u2192 Use Help \u2192 Check for updates.\n- **TeX Live** \u2192 Use `tlmgr update --all` in terminal (if TeX Live is installed via network installer).\n\n---\n\nLet me know your OS if you'd like a script or screenshot-specific instructions."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"64f46dfe-3ae7-4a16-8da8-6e1c61c5d539","request_id":"946c1568ca7e4840-IAD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"64f46dfe-3ae7-4a16-8da8-6e1c61c5d539","children":[]}}}
