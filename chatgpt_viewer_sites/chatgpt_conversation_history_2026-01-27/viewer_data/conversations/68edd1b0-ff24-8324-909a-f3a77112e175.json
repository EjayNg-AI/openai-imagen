I\u2019ve grouped things by theme and pointed to why they matter beyond \u201csolvability by radicals\u201d.\n\n---\n\n# 1) Beyond radicals: \u201chow hard is a polynomial to solve?\u201d\n\n**a) Resolvent degree (RD) & essential dimension (ed).**  \n- *Idea:* Replace the yes/no of \u201csolvable by radicals\u201d with a **complexity measure** of the best possible tower of \u201celementary\u201d covering maps needed to express roots.  \n- **RD** (revived recently by Farb\u2013Wolfson\u2013Wood and others) quantifies the minimal depth of resolvent operations needed to solve a problem (e.g. general degree-n equation, lines on a cubic surface, etc.).  \n- **Essential dimension** \\(\\mathrm{ed}(G)\\) (Buhler\u2013Reichstein \u2192 Brosnan\u2013Reichstein\u2013Vistoli, Karpenko\u2013Merkurjev, \u2026) asks for the **fewest parameters** needed to define a \\(G\\)-torsor. For \\(S_n\\) over \\(\\mathbb{C}\\), \\(\\mathrm{ed}(S_n)=n-3\\) for \\(n\\ge 5\\). This reframes solvability questions as **minimal parameter counts**.\n\n**b) Topological Galois theory (\u00e0 la Arnold\u2013Khovanskii).**  \n- Uses **monodromy** and topology of branched covers to obstruct representability of solutions by radicals (or even by broader classes like generalized quadratures).  \n- Gives robust, *coordinate-free* obstructions extending the classical \u201cgeneric quintic\u201d story.\n\n**c) Algorithmic Galois theory.**  \n- Fast, certified methods to **compute Galois groups** of polynomials (Stauduhar-type methods; van Hoeij\u2013Kl\u00fcners\u2013Fieker refinements), factorization over number fields, and decision procedures for solvability by radicals.  \n- Practical consequence: we can now **routinely determine** whether a concrete polynomial is solvable by radicals and, if so, produce radicals/parametrizations.\n\n---\n\n# 2) Inverse Galois & field arithmetic: from existence to distribution\n\n**a) Inverse Galois problem (IGP).**  \n- Large progress on realizing many finite groups as **Galois groups over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)** via **rigidity**, **patching**, and **Hilbert irreducibility**; deep advances for families (regular realizations over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(t)\\)) and many simple groups. The general IGP over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) remains open.  \n- **Patching over fields** (Harbater\u2013Hartmann\u2013Krashen): a flexible glueing technique that solves embedding problems and produces Galois extensions with prescribed local behavior.\n\n**b) Counting extensions & Malle\u2019s conjecture.**  \n- A shift from existence to **statistics**: asymptotics for number fields with bounded discriminant and a fixed Galois group. Major progress for \\(S_n\\) (Bhargava\u2019s work up to \\(n=5\\)), some families in other groups, and growing uniformity methods.\n\n**c) PAC fields, Hilbertian fields, and \u201cfield arithmetic\u201d (Fried\u2013Jarden).**  \n- Structural results on **absolute Galois groups**, largeness properties of fields, and **embedding problems** that generalize classical Hilbert irreducibility in a probabilistic/structural direction.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Geometric Galois theory: from polynomials to fundamental groups\n\n**a) Grothendieck\u2019s Galois theory of covers (\u00e9tale \\(\\pi_1\\)).**  \n- Reinterprets classical Galois theory as the theory of **finite \u00e9tale covers**; the **absolute Galois group** \\(G_K\\) acts on geometric objects (covers of curves), giving vast **Galois representations**.\n\n**b) Anabelian geometry.**  \n- For certain varieties (notably hyperbolic curves), the isomorphism class can be **recovered from its \u00e9tale fundamental group** (Grothendieck\u2019s anabelian conjectures; results of Mochizuki, Tamagawa, Pop, et al.).  \n- Deep links to Diophantine geometry (e.g., Kim\u2019s non-abelian Chabauty method for rational points).\n\n**c) Dessins d\u2019enfants & Belyi.**  \n- Every curve over \\(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}\\) corresponds to a **combinatorial dessin** (Belyi). The absolute Galois group \\(G_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\) acts on dessins; this yields concrete windows into the **mystery of \\(G_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\)** (Ihara, Drinfeld, Grothendieck\u2013Teichm\u00fcller).\n\n---\n\n# 4) Galois representations, \\(p\\)-adic Hodge theory, and Langlands\n\n**a) From solvability to modularity.**  \n- Wiles\u2013Taylor\u2013\u2026 modularity theorems linked **2-dimensional \\(p\\)-adic Galois representations** with **modular forms**, inaugurating a wave of **modularity-lifting** techniques (Kisin, Calegari\u2013Geraghty, et al.).  \n- Classical \u201csolvable by radicals\u201d corresponds to **solvable Galois groups**; in the modern picture, many problems become: *what automorphic data does a representation come from?*\n\n**b) \\(p\\)-adic Hodge theory (Fontaine and successors).**  \n- Classifies \\(p\\)-adic Galois representations (crystalline, de Rham, semistable), relating them to linear algebra over period rings.  \n- **Fontaine\u2013Mazur conjecture** and deformations of Galois representations organize major parts of modern number theory.\n\n---\n\n# 5) Differential / difference / parameterized Galois theories\n\n**a) Differential Galois (Picard\u2013Vessiot, Kolchin; modern: van der Put\u2013Singer).**  \n- A perfect analogue of field-Galois theory for **linear ODEs**: Liouvillian/elementary integrability corresponds to **solvable differential Galois group**.  \n- **Kovacic\u2019s algorithm** gives a decision procedure for second-order equations.  \n- Modern work extends to **difference** and **\\(q\\)-difference** equations, and **parameterized** theories (Cassidy\u2013Singer), with Tannakian formulations.\n\n**b) Tannakian formalism & motivic Galois.**  \n- Many Galois theories (classical, differential, Hodge/motivic) fit into **neutral Tannakian categories**, where the \u201cGalois group\u201d is the **affine group scheme of tensor automorphisms**.  \n- In the **motivic** setting (Grothendieck, Nori, Andr\u00e9), one seeks a \u201cGalois group of periods\u201d, tying algebraic cycles to transcendence questions (Kontsevich\u2013Zagier).\n\n---\n\n# 6) Positive characteristic & wild phenomena\n\n**a) Abhyankar\u2019s conjectures (solved: Raynaud; Harbater).**  \n- Precise description of finite groups occurring as Galois groups of covers of the affine line over **algebraically closed fields of char \\(p\\)**, reflecting **wild ramification** that has no analogue over \\(\\mathbb{C}\\).\n\n**b) Pro-\\(\\ell\\) and pro-\\(p\\) Galois groups; cohomology of number fields.**  \n- Deep structure theorems and obstructions via **Galois cohomology**, norm residue isomorphisms (Bloch\u2013Kato), and the modern use of cohomological dimension to constrain realizable groups.\n\n---\n\n# 7) Invariants of \u201chow explicit\u201d Galois theory can be\n\n**a) Noether\u2019s problem & rationality of \\(k(x_g)^G\\).**  \n- When is the field of invariants **purely transcendental**? Counterexamples (Saltman, Bogomolov) link to **unramified Brauer groups** and stable rationality problems.\n\n**b) Explicit class field theory beyond CM fields (Hilbert\u2019s 12th).**  \n- Ongoing attempts to generalize Kronecker\u2013Weber to **explicit generators** for abelian extensions of number fields (e.g., Stark/Brumer\u2013Stark heuristics, Rubin\u2013Stark, Gross\u2013Stark). This is the \u201cexplicit solvability\u201d frontier for **abelian** Galois groups.\n\n---\n\n# How this reframes \u201csolvability by radicals\u201d\n\n- **Radicals \u2194 solvable groups** gave a dichotomy. Modern work provides **graded invariants**:  \n  - **RD/ed** quantify the minimal *functional/combinatorial complexity*.  \n  - **Differential Galois** characterizes integrability by **group-theoretic solvability** in ODEs (a direct analogue).  \n  - **Topological/monodromy obstructions** generalize \u201cno radicals\u201d to broader classes of formulas.  \n  - **Tannakian/motivic** perspectives replace radicals by **tensor-functorial symmetries**; \u201csolving\u201d means understanding the **group scheme** acting on solutions.\n\n---\n\n# Representative open problems & frontiers\n\n- **Inverse Galois over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\):** realize every finite group?
