Add the directory to `sys.path`**\nThis is a simple way to temporarily add the directory to Python's module search path.\n\n#### Example:\nAssume the directory structure:\n```\nproject/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 utils/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 helper.py\n```\n\nIf you want to import a function `my_function` from `helper.py` into `main.py`:\n\n**main.py**:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport os\n\n# Add the directory containing helper.py to sys.path\nsys.path.append(os.path.abspath(\"utils\"))\n\n# Now import the function\nfrom helper import my_function\n\n# Use the function\nmy_function()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Use a `PYTHONPATH` environment variable**\nYou can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the directory containing the file you want to import.\n\n#### Example:\nRun Python with `PYTHONPATH` set:\n```bash\nPYTHONPATH=./utils python main.py\n```\n\nThen in `main.py`, you can directly import the function:\n```python\nfrom helper import my_function\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Create a package with `__init__.py`**\nIf the target directory is part of a larger project, it\u2019s better to structure it as a Python package.\n\n#### Example:\nModify the directory structure:\n```\nproject/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 utils/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 helper.py\n```\n\nNow, `__init__.py` makes `utils` a package, so you can import `helper` like this:\n```python\nfrom utils.helper import my_function\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Use relative imports (if running as part of a package)**\nIf `main.py` is part of a package, you can use relative imports.\n\n#### Example:\n```python\nfrom .utils.helper import my_function\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Key Notes**\n1. **`sys.path` and `PYTHONPATH`** are useful for quick and dirty solutions during development, but for production, organizing your project as a package is the best approach.\n2. Ensure the working directory matches your expected structure if you encounter import issues.\n3. Avoid using relative imports if running scripts standalone; they are best suited for module imports within packages. \n\nIf you share your specific directory structure or setup, I can suggest a tailored approach!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"e9ec89e3-4b42-4f5c-9b61-aa7e482fbba2","request_id":"8f90e31c0ea88811-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e9ec89e3-4b42-4f5c-9b61-aa7e482fbba2","children":[]}}}
