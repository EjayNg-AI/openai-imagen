Immigration rates are predicted to add fewer people annually, affected by Biden administration policies and potential future changes under President-elect Donald Trump.

While most rallies remained peaceful, the day was marred by violence, including a politically motivated shooting in Minneapolis that killed Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, and other incidents in Salt Lake City and Austin involving threats and gunfire. Protesters, spanning all ages and political backgrounds, voiced their concerns through chants, music, and banners emphasizing democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. Demonstrations took place in cities like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Nashville, Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, drawing tens of thousands of people. Participants expressed fear over the nation\u2019s political trajectory and sought to rally support for marginalized communities targeted by Trump's policies. Simultaneously, Trump held a military-themed celebration in Washington for the Army's 250th birthday and his own 79th, drawing comparisons to autocratic regimes.
