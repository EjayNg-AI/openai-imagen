heavy pedestrian traffic at Farrer Rd market on weekends.  \n* **ERP**: single gantry (Lornie Hwy, city-bound); tariffs zero outside morning peak and most evenings.\n\n#### 2. 297724 \u2192 530203 (Hougang Street 21)\n\n* **Common path (fastest unless KPE is clear)**: Thomson Lane \u2192 Braddell Rd east \u2192 merge onto CTE N \u2192 exit 10 (Serangoon / Braddell) \u2192 Upper Serangoon Rd \u2192 Hougang Str 21.  \n  *Alternate*: Lornie Hwy \u2192 PIE E \u2192 KPE N \u2192 Exit 6 Hougang.  \n* **Distance & time**: ~7 km \u201cas planned\u201d, but *effective* travel often 9-12 km because of expressway routing; 9-12 min off-peak, **20-30 min or more in peak** when CTE northbound is congested.  \n* **Hazards**:  \n  * Multi-lane CTE merge from Braddell is short; sudden braking common.  \n  * Upper Serangoon right-turn into estate can queue.  \n* **ERP**: CTE gantry (peak) + occasional Braddell (evening), plus KPE gantry if that route chosen.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnless you have a very specific reason to avoid Farrer Road (e.g., Saturday morning market gridlock or an ERP-averse route at very particular times), **260004 is the easier destination** in terms of:\n\n* **Shorter, more direct path**  \n* **Fewer expressway merges and exits**  \n* **Less severe peak-hour congestion**  \n* **Lower ERP exposure and fuel/time cost**\n\nOnly in unusual circumstances\u2014e.g., a major accident blocking Farrer Road while the CTE is flowing free\u2014would Hougang become the quicker or simpler drive.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 *ERP charges vary by half-hour block; figures here assume typical weekday AM (07:30 \u2013 09:30) when charges are highest.*"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue201","start_idx":352,"end_idx":370,"safe_urls":["https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Caldecott-MRT-Station/Farrer-Road-MRT-Station"],"refs":[],"alt":"([rome2rio.com](https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Caldecott-MRT-Station/Farrer-Road-MRT-Station))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Caldecott MRT Station to Farrer Road MRT Station - 3 ways to travel via subway","url":"https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Caldecott-MRT-Station/Farrer-Road-MRT-Station","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"rome2rio.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201","start_idx":380,"end_idx":398,"safe_urls":["https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Thomson-Road/Hougang"],"refs":[],"alt":"([rome2rio.com](https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Thomson-Road/Hougang))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Thomson Road to Hougang - 5 ways to travel via subway, line 151 bus, and taxi","url":"https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Thomson-Road/Hougang","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"rome2rio.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue201","start_idx":521,"end_idx":539,"safe_urls":["https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Caldecott-MRT-Station/Farrer-Road-MRT-Station"],"refs":[],"alt":"([rome2rio.com](https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Caldecott-MRT-Station/Farrer-Road-MRT-Station))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Caldecott MRT Station to Farrer Road MRT Station - 3 ways to travel via subway","url":"https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Caldecott-MRT-Station/Farrer-Road-MRT-Station","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"rome2rio.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201","start_idx":550,"end_idx":568,"safe_urls":["https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Thomson-Road/Hougang"],"refs":[],"alt":"([rome2rio.com](https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Thomson-Road/Hougang))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Thomson Road to Hougang - 5 ways to travel via subway, line 151 bus, and taxi","url":"https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Thomson-Road/Hougang","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"rome2rio.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":3591,"end_idx":3591,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Caldecott MRT Station to Farrer Road MRT Station - 3 ways to travel via subway","url":"https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Caldecott-MRT-Station/Farrer-Road-MRT-Station","attribution":"rome2rio.com"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Caldecott-MRT-Station/Farrer-Road-MRT-Station","https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Thomson-Road/Hougang","https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Caldecott-MRT-Station/Farrer-Road-MRT-Station","https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Thomson-Road/Hougang"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"postcodebase.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://sgp.postcodebase.com/node/59982?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Sky@eleven, Thomson Lane, 5, Singapore, Thomson, Thomson ...","snippet":"Sky@eleven, Thomson Lane, 5, Singapore, Thomson, Thomson Road, North is located in Singapore.
