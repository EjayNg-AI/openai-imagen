Butter and Ice Cream: MAHA Sets Up Fight Over Saturated Fat","snippet":"The article discusses a brewing controversy over saturated fat in the American diet, spurred by the new \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d (MAHA) strategy led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The MAHA initiative calls for updated dietary guidelines that advocate for increased consumption of saturated fats from whole foods like full-fat dairy, meat, and butter\u2014contrasting decades of government advice warning against these fats due to their link to heart disease. Kennedy, who follows a carnivore-based diet, supports bringing back full-fat dairy to schools and praises the use of beef tallow by food companies.\n\nThe proposed shift has alarmed many scientists, including members of the federal dietary guidelines advisory committee, who emphasize that saturated fats from sources like butter and red meat elevate bad cholesterol (LDL) and increase the risk of heart disease. While scientific consensus acknowledges that saturated fats raise cholesterol levels, recent conflicting studies have muddled public understanding\u2014especially studies that don\u2019t account for what replaces saturated fat in the diet.\n\nExperts note that while full-fat dairy may have some health benefits, red and processed meats present clearer risks. The USDA's forthcoming guidelines aim to emphasize whole, nutritious foods and limit highly processed, sugary items. Scientists recommend more plant-based foods for better health outcomes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1760799600.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.nejm.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1800389","title":"Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a ...","snippet":"by R Estruch \u00b7 2018 \u00b7 Cited by 3922 \u2014 The incidence of major cardiovascular events was lower among those assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.nejm.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1200303","title":"Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a ...","snippet":"by R Estruch \u00b7 2013 \u00b7 Cited by 6471 \u2014 A Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.nejm.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.efsa.europa.eu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2033","title":"Polyphenols in olive related health claims - EFSA","snippet":"Apr 8, 2011 \u2014 Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to polyphenols in olive and protection of LDL particles from oxidative damage.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.efsa.europa.eu"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ahajournals.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/cir.0000000000000510","title":"Dietary Fats and Cardiovascular Disease: A Presidential ...","snippet":"by FM Sacks \u00b7 2017 \u00b7 Cited by 1766 \u2014 The current AHA/American College of Cardiology guideline is to decrease intake of saturated fat to 5% to 6% of total daily energy (calorie) ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.ahajournals.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11353474/","title":"Health Outcomes Associated with Olive Oil Intake","snippet":"by M Chiavarini \u00b7 2024 \u00b7 Cited by 20 \u2014 A recent umbrella review [41] found that a Mediterranean diet and high olive oil consumption significantly reduces stroke risk, but does not ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.sciencedirect.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1933287415004274","title":"Impact of avocado-enriched diets on plasma lipoproteins","snippet":"by S Peou \u00b7 2016 \u00b7 Cited by 101 \u2014 It is proposed that avocados reduce lipid levels by enhancing the breakdown of TG-rich lipoproteins and inhibiting VLDL-C secretion from the liver, resulting in ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.sciencedirect.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523027788","title":"Protection of LDL from oxidation by olive oil polyphenols is ...","snippet":"by O Casta\u00f1er \u00b7 2012 \u00b7 Cited by 160 \u2014 Conclusions: In addition to reducing LDL oxidation, the intake of polyphenol-rich olive oil reduces CD40L gene expression, its downstream products, and related ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.sciencedirect.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405457725029055","title":"Is avocado beneficial for lipid profiles?

Replacing 10 grams of margarine, butter, mayonnaise, or dairy fat with olive oil daily also reduces overall mortality risk. The study analyzed data from over 92,000 participants across 28 years from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Participants who consumed more olive oil exhibited healthier lifestyles, including smoking less, exercising more, and eating more fruits and vegetables.

The research involved over 100,000 participants who reported their avocado intake through questionnaires. Findings showed a 16% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk and a 21% decrease in coronary heart disease risk among higher avocado consumers. \n\nAvocados provide essential nutrients, especially high levels of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are beneficial for heart health. They help lower LDL cholesterol, which is associated with heart attacks and strokes. Additionally, avocados are a good source of dietary fiber, aiding in cholesterol management. \n\nHowever, experts advise against considering avocados as a sole \u2018magical bullet\u2019 for health, emphasizing the importance of a balanced diet with various healthy fat sources like olive oil, nuts, and seeds. Replacing saturated fats with healthier alternatives, including avocados, is recommended for better heart health.

Here's What a Scientist Has to Say","snippet":"Cooking with olive oil, especially extra-virgin olive oil, remains nutritionally safe if done at or below 375\u00b0F, which is its average smoke point. While heat can reduce some antioxidants\u2014up to 75% at 338\u00b0F\u2014olive oil still retains enough polyphenols to meet European health standards. Moreover, olive oil's antioxidants may transfer to foods during cooking, enhancing their nutritional value. Nutritionally, olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats like oleic acid, and it supports heart health and reduces inflammation. However, the biggest drawback to heating olive oil is the loss of its delicate flavors and flavonoids. Experts recommend using it raw when possible to preserve both taste and health benefits, such as drizzling over dishes or using in dressings. For high-heat cooking, alternatives like avocado, grapeseed, or canola oil are recommended due to their higher smoke points and neutral flavors. Ultimately, olive oil remains a safe and healthy cooking fat, but choosing when and how to use it depends on balancing heat, flavor retention, and cost.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1744656891.0,"attribution":"www.eatingwell.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"ucfoodquality.ucdavis.edu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ucfoodquality.ucdavis.edu/avocado/avocado-oil","title":"Avocado Oil | UC Food Quality","snippet":"Green, H.

The study involved 29 store-brand samples, with only three meeting basic quality standards. The oils often contained other ingredients such as canola, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils. The lack of enforceable standards for avocado oils means consumers may be paying for inferior or potentially unsafe products. Researcher Selina Wang advocates for establishing standards to improve avocado oil quality, similar to the advancements made in the olive oil industry. To select quality avocado oil, consumers should choose oils sold in green glass bottles with sealed caps and check for a pale green color. The study only tested private label oils, and more details are available in the published research. Until standards are improved, consumers may consider alternative oils.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1686488400.0,"attribution":"www.allrecipes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.health.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.health.com/dietitians-agree-healthiest-oil-to-cook-with-11817530","title":"5 Dietitians Agree on the Healthiest Cooking Oil You Should Use","snippet":"Five registered dietitians were consulted to identify the healthiest cooking oil for everyday use. The consensus was that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) tops the list due to its rich content of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols, and its proven cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. EVOO is particularly suited for low- to medium-heat cooking, as high heat can degrade its beneficial compounds. Its favorable fatty acid profile and anti-inflammatory properties also help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. EVOO is best used raw or lightly heated in dressings, marinades, or as a finishing touch on foods.\n\nAvocado oil was the second-highest pick, praised for its high smoke point (up to 520\u00b0F for refined avocado oil), mild taste, and similar monounsaturated fat content. This makes it ideal for high-heat cooking such as roasting or saut\u00e9ing. While both oils are nutritious, the choice may depend on cooking application and flavor preference. Overall, olive oil is widely recommended for its versatility and strong evidence supporting its health benefits.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1759774674.0,"attribution":"www.health.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fb0beb6db48324a19bbec52ac732f7","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for studies on avocado oil quality and stability","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5256cc3b-e3e4-948d-9ca4-e5bad3d73a27","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"97dd20f8-554a-4c29-b1f2-fffeb58b4327","turn_exchange_id":"2a12f596-ccad-4302-9035-b4da0498bb9b","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"97dd20f8-554a-4c29-b1f2-fffeb58b4327","children":["8eda9696-d189-4851-b595-7b3960c3c47f"]},"8eda9696-d189-4851-b595-7b3960c3c47f":{"id":"8eda9696-d189-4851-b595-7b3960c3c47f","message":{"id":"8eda9696-d189-4851-b595-7b3960c3c47f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761283063.052741,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Staying focused on high-quality sources","content":"I should avoid relying on news media for claims.

Replacing 10 grams of margarine, butter, mayonnaise, or dairy fat with olive oil daily also reduces overall mortality risk. The study analyzed data from over 92,000 participants across 28 years from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Participants who consumed more olive oil exhibited healthier lifestyles, including smoking less, exercising more, and eating more fruits and vegetables. Researchers emphasize that olive oil's monounsaturated fatty acids and potential anti-inflammatory benefits contribute to improved cholesterol levels and reduced saturated fat intake, promoting heart health. Incorporating olive oil into the diet, such as using it in place of saturated fats, is recommended as part of a healthy eating pattern.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1642027882.0,"attribution":"www.eatingwell.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"people.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://people.com/olive-oil-could-lower-risk-of-dying-from-dementia-study-finds-8645967","title":"This Popular Ingredient Lowers Your Risk of Dying from Dementia - and It's Probably in Your Pantry Right Now","snippet":"A recent study by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, published in the JAMA Network, found that consuming olive oil may lower the risk of dying from dementia. The study observed over 92,000 health professionals between 1990 and 2018, finding that those who consumed 7 grams of olive oil daily had a 28% lower risk of dementia-related death. The study included over 60,000 women from the Nurses' Health Study and nearly 32,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Researchers noted that replacing 5 grams of margarine or mayonnaise with olive oil was associated with an 8-14% lower risk of dementia-related mortality. They also found that individuals with the APOE e4 gene were significantly more likely to die with dementia. The study suggested that olive oil's monounsaturated fats and antioxidant properties might protect brain health and emphasized further research to confirm these findings.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1715274260.0,"attribution":"people.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fb0beb6db48324a19bbec52ac732f7","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for olive oil studies and health outcomes","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5256cc3b-e3e4-948d-9ca4-e5bad3d73a27","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"cbd0d7d6-27be-4017-ae2d-d35cb8021bdb","turn_exchange_id":"2a12f596-ccad-4302-9035-b4da0498bb9b","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cbd0d7d6-27be-4017-ae2d-d35cb8021bdb","children":["0fafc1c9-9662-4bd8-8140-1120c2f124a8"]},"0fafc1c9-9662-4bd8-8140-1120c2f124a8":{"id":"0fafc1c9-9662-4bd8-8140-1120c2f124a8","message":{"id":"0fafc1c9-9662-4bd8-8140-1120c2f124a8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761283067.390241,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for 23s"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":23,"model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","request_id":"5256cc3b-e3e4-948d-9ca4-e5bad3d73a27","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"ac0f435c-befc-44bd-9959-6d4c1d2dd9d6","turn_exchange_id":"2a12f596-ccad-4302-9035-b4da0498bb9b","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ac0f435c-befc-44bd-9959-6d4c1d2dd9d6","children":["659282c7-3ad2-42a7-9f2c-71c98e27fb70"]},"659282c7-3ad2-42a7-9f2c-71c98e27fb70":{"id":"659282c7-3ad2-42a7-9f2c-71c98e27fb70","message":{"id":"659282c7-3ad2-42a7-9f2c-71c98e27fb70","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761283067.321192,"update_time":1761283092.886556,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Short answer: **Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO): yes, strongly.** **Avocado oil: plausible but the human evidence is thin; most benefits are extrapolated from its fat profile or from whole-avocado studies rather than from avocado *oil* trials.**\n\n# What\u2019s actually established\n\n## Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO)\n- **Cardiovascular outcomes (hard endpoints).** In PREDIMED\u2014an RCT in ~7,400 high-risk adults\u2014assigning people to a Mediterranean diet **supplemented with EVOO** reduced major cardiovascular events versus a control low-fat diet. The trial was corrected and republished in NEJM; the result held. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- **Mechanism-level consensus.** The American Heart Association\u2019s scientific advisory concludes that replacing saturated fat with **unsaturated fats** (as in olive oil) lowers LDL-C and cardiovascular events. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search17\ue201\n- **Observational mortality data (supportive).** Large U.S. cohorts (JACC, 92k adults) link higher olive-oil intake with **lower total and cause-specific mortality**; replacing butter/margarine with olive oil is associated with lower risk. Associations \u2260 causation, but they line up with trial/biologic data. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search18\ue201\n- **Polyphenol-specific claim.** The EU regulator (EFSA) allows a health claim: olive-oil polyphenols (notably hydroxytyrosol, usually retained in **extra-virgin**, not refined oil) **protect LDL from oxidative damage**\u2014cause-and-effect judged established when the oil provides \u22655 mg hydroxytyrosol+ derivatives per 20 g (~1\u00bd Tbsp). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search16\ue201\n\n**Bottom line for EVOO:** There is **trial-grade evidence** that a dietary pattern rich in EVOO improves cardiovascular outcomes, plus mechanistic and cohort support. The signal is strongest for **extra-virgin** (polyphenols intact), not for refined olive oil.\n\n## Avocado oil\n- **Direct trials on the *oil* are scarce.** A handful of small studies (some non-U.S., some non-randomized or animal) suggest favorable lipid changes when avocado oil replaces saturated fat, but this evidence is **limited and not outcome-based**. (Example: small trials and narrative reviews; quality is mixed.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n- **Evidence for the *fruit* (supportive but indirect).** Meta-analyses and umbrella reviews on **avocado intake** (the whole fruit) show **reductions in LDL-C and total cholesterol**, especially in people with dyslipidemia; effects on HDL-C/TG are inconsistent. That supports the *idea* that a MUFA-rich avocado-derived fat is cardiometabolically favorable, but it is **not the same as showing avocado oil improves hard outcomes.** \ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search18\ue201\n- **Quality/adulteration caveat.** Multiple analyses of retail avocado oil in North America report **high rates of rancidity or adulteration** (often blended with cheaper seed oils) and call for standards; this muddies any expected benefit if what\u2019s in the bottle isn\u2019t pure. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search10\ue201\n\n**Bottom line for avocado oil:** Nutritionally it\u2019s **mostly oleic acid (MUFA)** like olive oil and should be **healthier than saturated fats** when used as a replacement, but **we lack large, high-quality human trials on avocado oil itself** or hard endpoints. Choose reputable, purity-tested brands if you use it.\n\n# Practical guidance (evidence-weighted)\n- If you want the **most established health benefits**, make **EVOO your default fat**, ideally **extra-virgin** with declared/high polyphenols. Using it to replace butter/tallow/shortening is where the benefit lives. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n- **Cooking stability:** Ignore marketing around smoke point. Independent work indicates **EVOO is among the most oxidation-stable oils in real cooking conditions**; refined avocado oil is also stable, but purity is the wild card. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search20\ue201\n- **When to pick avocado oil:** If you prefer its neutral taste for **high-heat searing/roasting**, use a **reputable refined** avocado oil\u2014but be choosy due to the adulteration problem. (Look for brands with third-party testing or published fatty-acid/sterol profiles.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search10\ue201\n- **Dose reality check:** You don\u2019t need huge amounts. In trials/cohorts, **~1\u20132 Tbsp/day** replacing saturated fat is typical and reasonable. (EFSA\u2019s polyphenol claim is met by ~20 g/day of high-polyphenol EVOO.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n# The critique in one line\n- **EVOO:** Benefits are **scientifically established** (strongest within a Mediterranean-style pattern).  \n- **Avocado oil:** **Biologically plausible** and likely fine as a **replacement fat**, but **not yet backed by outcome-grade human trials**; watch out for **adulteration**.\n\nIf you want, I can shortlist **high-polyphenol EVOOs** (with published lab values) and **avocado oils** with independent purity
