In short: **review \u2192 verify CI checks \u2192 choose a merge strategy \u2192 execute the merge (UI, CLI, or local) \u2192 sync local clones and clean-up**.\n\n---\n\n## 1  Understand what a pull request actually is  \nA PR is just a proposal to merge the *head* branch (the one Codex created) into the *base* branch (usually `main`). It shows an inline diff, collects review comments, and runs your CI checks. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 2  Prepare the PR for merge  \n\n### 2.1  Run/verify automated checks  \nIf you have branch protection rules that require status checks or reviews, the PR cannot be merged until those succeed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n\n### 2.2  Handle merge conflicts (if any)  \nYou can resolve conflicts on the GitHub web editor or locally:  \n\n```bash\n# Fetch the PR locally (replace 123 with PR number)\ngit fetch origin pull/123/head:codex-fix\ngit checkout codex-fix\n# fix files, commit, and push\ngit push -u origin codex-fix\n```  \nThe updated branch will refresh the PR automatically. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 3  Choose your merge strategy  \n\n| Strategy | When to use | Result in `main` |\n|----------|-------------|------------------|\n| **Merge commit** (`--merge`) | Keep full history | One extra *merge* commit + all original commits \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 |\n| **Squash & merge** (`--squash`) | You want a tidy linear history | Single commit containing all changes \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201 |\n| **Rebase & merge** (`--rebase`) | You need a linear history *and* the individual commits | Original commits replayed on top of `main` (fast-forward) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 |\n\nYour repository settings may enable or disable any of the above. Pick the style that fits your history policy.  \n\n---\n\n## 4  Merge the PR \u2014 three equivalent workflows  \n\n### 4.1  GitHub web UI (one-click)  \n1. Open the PR page.  \n2. Confirm all checks are green.  \n3. Press **\u201cMerge pull request\u201d**, select the strategy, and confirm. Done. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n\n### 4.2  GitHub CLI (`gh`) \u2014 fast and scriptable  \n```bash\n# If you\u2019re on the PR branch already:\ngh pr merge --merge           # or --squash / --rebase\n# Or merge by PR number from anywhere:\ngh pr merge 123 --squash\n```  \nThe CLI respects branch-protection rules and will enable auto-merge if checks are still running. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n\n### 4.3  Plain git (local merge)  \n1. **Check out** the PR locally:  \n\n   ```bash\n   git fetch origin pull/123/head:codex-fix\n   git checkout main\n   git merge --no-ff codex-fix   # or --squash / rebase workflow\n   git push origin main\n   ```  \n2. After pushing, go to the PR page and **mark it as merged** (or close it) so GitHub records the merge. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 5  Post-merge housekeeping  \n\n* **Delete the feature branch** \u2013 GitHub will prompt you, or run `gh pr merge --delete-branch`.  \n* **Sync your local clones** \u2013 `git pull` on other machines so everyone is on the updated `main`.  \n* **Tag or release** if your workflow requires versioning.  \n\n---\n\n## 6  Forward-looking tips  \n\n| Practice | Why it helps |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Enable auto-merge** for green PRs | Lets Codex-generated PRs land automatically once CI passes, saving manual clicks. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 |\n| **Use a merge queue** (beta) | Serialises merges to avoid rebasing wars on busy repos. |\n| **Configure CODEOWNERS** | Ensures at least one human signs off before merging AI-generated code. |\n| **Mergify/Probot rules** | Automate labeling, back-ports, or merge-methods based on PR metadata. |\n\n---\n\n### Key take-away  \nOnce ChatGPT Codex raises a pull request, *implementing* the change is exactly the same as with any human-authored PR: make sure tests pass and reviews are done, pick your merge style, and perform the merge via the GitHub UI, the `gh` CLI, or a local `git merge`.
