Here are the main requirements:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Age Requirement\n- You must be **at least 17 years old** as of **1 January** of the examination year.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Eligibility Criteria\nPrivate candidates are generally those who:\n- Are **not enrolled** in a Junior College (JC), Millennia Institute (MI), or other schools approved to conduct the GCE A-Levels in that year.  \n- Wish to **retake** the A-Levels after leaving school.  \n- Are adult learners seeking to sit the exam for the first time.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Subjects You Can Take\n- Private candidates are usually allowed to register for **H1, H2, and H3 subjects**, but **restrictions apply**:  \n  - Some subjects (e.g. Project Work, Mother Tongue Language Syllabus B, certain coursework-heavy or lab-based subjects like H2 Art, H2 Music, H2 Design & Technology, H2 Physical Education, and some H3 subjects) are **not available** to private candidates because they require sustained school-based assessments or special facilities.  \n  - Sciences (H2 Physics, Chemistry, Biology) can be taken, but you must sit the **practical exams** as well, so you need to be prepared for that.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Examination Format & Rules\n- Private candidates take the **same written papers** as school candidates.  \n- You must sit for **Project Work (PW)** and **Mother Tongue Language (MTL)** unless you have already satisfied those requirements in a previous sitting.  \n- If you previously passed PW and/or MTL at A-Level or equivalent, you do not need to retake them.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Registration\n- Registration is usually open in **March** of the examination year through SEAB\u2019s online portal.  \n- You will need a **Singpass** (for Singaporeans/PRs) or relevant identification if you are a foreigner.  \n- Examination fees are payable at registration, and they vary depending on the number and level of subjects chosen.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **In summary:**  \nAnyone aged 17 or above, not currently enrolled in a JC/MI or other approved school, can register as a private candidate for the GCE A-Levels.
