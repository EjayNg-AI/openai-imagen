This Einstein ring, a rare and significant find, assists in studying mass distribution, including dark matter. Only 11% dark matter was found in NGC 6505, considered low as dark matter predominantly constitutes the universe's mass. The European Space Agency's \u20ac1bn mission aims to map the cosmos in 3D, revealing dark matter distribution and dark energy's effects on universal expansion. Besides deep-space images up to 10bn light-years away, Euclid showcases unprecedented detailed observations in the nearby universe.

Using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at Kitt Peak National Observatory, which observes 5,000 galaxies simultaneously, the team tracked cosmic structure growth. Einstein\u2019s theory, which connects space, time, and gravity, was validated against how gravity influences cosmic phenomena. The study, led by University of Michigan's Dragan Huterer, explored the universe's expansion, initially postulated as accelerated by dark energy. DESI's observations of nearly 6 million galaxies indicated a cosmic structure produced by gravitational pull. Additionally, DESI suggested a dynamic nature for dark energy, differing from its previously assumed constancy, potentially altering future cosmic expansion. This study reinforces the standard model of cosmology, integrating general relativity, while proposing dark energy\u2019s variation, marking significant progress since 1998's discovery of cosmic acceleration. The research, involving over 900 scientists globally, was published on arXiv ahead of peer review.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"reuters.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news60\ue201","start_idx":4833,"end_idx":4851,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/science/euclid-mission-data-release-is-step-toward-grand-atlas-cosmos-2025-03-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/science/euclid-mission-data-release-is-step-toward-grand-atlas-cosmos-2025-03-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Euclid mission data release is step toward grand atlas of the cosmos","url":"https://www.reuters.com/science/euclid-mission-data-release-is-step-toward-grand-atlas-cosmos-2025-03-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1742382846.0,"snippet":"La Agencia Espacial Europea (ESA) ha lanzado su primer lote de datos de la misi\u00f3n del telescopio espacial Euclid destinado a mapear la estructura a gran escala del universo para entender mejor los componentes c\u00f3smicos oscuros como la energ\u00eda oscura y la materia oscura.
