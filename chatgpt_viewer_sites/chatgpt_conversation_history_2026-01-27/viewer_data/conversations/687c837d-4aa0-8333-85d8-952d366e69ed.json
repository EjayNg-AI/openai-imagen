What \u201c\u202f*t\u202f=\u202f0*\u202f\u201d means in cosmology  \n\n* In the standard FLRW (Friedmann\u2011Lema\u00eetre\u2011Robertson\u2011Walker) models of general relativity, **cosmic time** is the proper time measured by an idealised comoving observer who sees the Universe as homogeneous and isotropic.  \n* Solving Einstein\u2019s equations backwards, the scale factor\u00a0*a(t)* shrinks to zero at a finite time in the past. Mathematically that point is labelled *t\u202f=\u202f0* and is called the **Big\u2011Bang singularity**.  \n* A singularity in GR is not a \u201cplace\u201d where the Universe actually sits; it is a boundary where the classical equations predict diverging curvature, density and temperature. The manifold itself ends there\u2014so strictly speaking there is no physical spacetime **at** *t\u202f=\u202f0*.\n\n### 2. The Planck time and the limit of classical physics  \n\nThe **Planck time**  \n\\[\nt_{\\text P} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar G}{c^{5}}}\\;\\approx\\;5.39\\times10^{-44}\\ \\text{s}\n\\]  \nmarks the scale at which quantum fluctuations of spacetime itself, not just of matter fields, are expected to dominate. Between *t\u202f=\u202ft_P* and, say, *10^{-32}\u00a0s*, classical GR is almost certainly inadequate because:\n\n| Quantity | Classical GR prediction as *t\u202f\u2192\u202f0* | Issue |\n|----------|-------------------------------------|-------|\n| Energy density \u03c1 | \u03c1\u202f\u221d\u202f*t*\u207b\u00b2 \u2192 \u221e | Diverges, violating any sensible energy condition at quantum scales |\n| Curvature invariants (e.g.\u202fKretschmann scalar) | \u221d\u202f*t*\u207b\u2074 \u2192 \u221e | Quantum gravity needed |\n| Horizon size | *c\u00a0t* \u2192 0 | Causal patches shrink below Planck length |\n\nHence **the earliest epoch about which we can even hope to make physically meaningful statements with current theory is roughly one Planck time after the putative singularity**. For convenience cosmologists often quote *10^{-43}\u00a0s* (one order of magnitude) as \u201cthe Planck epoch.\u201d\n\n### 3. Is *t\u202f=\u202f0* ever useful?  \n\n*Mathematically*: yes. If you integrate the Friedmann equation to compute the present age of the Universe, you integrate from *t\u202f=\u202f0* to *t\u202f=\u202fnow*. The result (\u2248\u202f13.8\u00a0Gyr) is insensitive to the unknown physics at the singularity because almost all the integrand weight lies at late times. So *t\u202f=\u202f0* serves as a convenient lower limit\u2014even though we know it is an extrapolation.\n\n*Physically*: no consensus. Three broad attitudes exist:\n\n1. **Operational\u2011agnostic** (mainstream \u039bCDM): treat *t\u202f=\u202f0* as a formal limit; restrict physical claims to *t\u00a0\u2265\u00a0t_P*.  \n2. **Singularity\u2011resolving theories**: in loop quantum cosmology, causal\u2011set ideas, string gas, ekpyrotic or \u201cbig bounce\u201d models, the singularity is replaced by a bounce or phase transition. In those pictures *t\u202f=\u202f0* is either \u201cnothing special\u201d (just a coordinate choice) or is replaced by *t\u202f=\u202f0* = bounce surface with finite curvature.  \n3. **Agnostic minimalists**: refrain from even talking about *t\u202f<\u202ft_P* until a predictive quantum\u2011gravity theory is experimentally supported.\n\n### 4. Observational constraints stop long before *t_P*\n\n| Probe | Earliest time constrained | Key physical era |\n|-------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| CMB anisotropies | 380\u202f000\u00a0yr | Photon decoupling |\n| Big\u2011bang nucleosynthesis | 0.1\u2013100\u00a0s | Light\u2011element yields |\n| Primordial gravitational waves (hypothetical) | \u2273\u202f10\u207b\u00b3\u00b2\u00a0s | Inflationary era |\n\nNo measurement yet reaches anywhere near the Planck epoch; all earlier statements rely on extrapolation of theory.\n\n### 5. Bottom\u2011line answer  \n\n* It is **mathematically convenient** to label the start of an FLRW solution as *t\u202f=\u202f0*, but that point is **not part of physical spacetime** in classical general relativity.  \n* **Meaningful physical talk** begins no earlier than one Planck time (*\u2248\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u2074\u2074\u00a0s*), because before that our descriptions require a quantum\u2011gravity theory we don\u2019t yet possess.  \n* Whether *t\u202f=\u202f0* has any deeper significance depends on which candidate quantum\u2011cosmology framework ultimately proves correct.
