Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to code your WordPress theme for SEO:\n\n### 1. **Semantic HTML**\n\n- **Use Proper HTML Tags**: Structure your content with appropriate HTML tags:\n  - **Header Tags**: Use `<header>` for header sections, `<h1>` for the main title, and `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc., for subheadings.\n  - **Navigation**: Use `<nav>` for navigation menus.\n  - **Main Content**: Wrap your main content in `<main>`.\n  - **Articles and Sections**: Use `<article>` and `<section>` for distinct content areas.\n  - **Footers**: Use `<footer>` for footer content.\n\n### 2. **Meta Tags**\n\n- **Title Tags**: Ensure that your theme supports dynamic title tags. Use the `wp_title()` function or integrate with SEO plugins like Yoast SEO to generate dynamic titles.\n- **Meta Descriptions**: While meta descriptions are often managed by plugins, ensure your theme allows them to be added in the `<head>` section of the HTML.\n\n### 3. **Structured Data**\n\n- **Schema Markup**: Implement structured data (Schema.org) to help search engines understand the content of your pages. You can add JSON-LD structured data in the `<head>` section or use plugins for this.\n  ```html\n  <script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n  {\n    \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n    \"name\": \"Your Company Name\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.yourwebsite.com\",\n    \"logo\": \"https://www.yourwebsite.com/logo.png\"\n  }\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n### 4. **Mobile Optimization**\n\n- **Responsive Design**: Use responsive design principles to ensure your site works well on all devices. Utilize media queries in your CSS:\n  ```css\n  @media (max-width: 768px) {\n    /* Mobile-specific styles */\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 5. **Page Speed Optimization**\n\n- **Minimize CSS & JS**: Minify and combine CSS and JavaScript files. Use tools like `gulp` or `grunt` for this.\n- **Deferred Loading**: Defer non-essential JavaScript to speed up page loading:\n  ```html\n  <script src=\"your-script.js\" defer></script>\n  ```\n- **Optimize Images**: Use responsive images with the `srcset` attribute and compress images.\n\n### 6. **Canonical URLs**\n\n- **Avoid Duplicate Content**: Implement canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues. This can be managed by SEO plugins, or you can manually add canonical tags:\n  ```html\n  <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://www.yourwebsite.com/page-url\" />\n  ```\n\n### 7. **Sitemap Integration**\n\n- **XML Sitemap**: Ensure your theme or plugins generate an XML sitemap and submit it to Google Search Console. Most SEO plugins handle this automatically.\n- **HTML Sitemap**: Provide a human-readable HTML sitemap for users and search engines.\n\n### 8. **Robots Meta Tags**\n\n- **Control Crawling**: Use robots meta tags to control which pages are indexed by search engines:\n  ```html\n  <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow\" />\n  ```\n\n### 9. **Breadcrumbs**\n\n- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Implement breadcrumbs to enhance navigation and improve SEO. Use schema markup to highlight breadcrumb trails:\n  ```html\n  <nav class=\"breadcrumb\">\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"/category\">Category</a></li>\n      <li>Current Page</li>\n    </ul>\n  </nav>\n  ```\n\n### 10. **Clean Code**\n\n- **Avoid Inline Styles**: Use external CSS files instead of inline styles for better maintainability and performance.\n- **Avoid Unnecessary Plugins**: Minimize the use of plugins that can bloat your site and impact performance.\n\n### 11. **Accessibility**\n\n- **Alt Text for Images**: Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` attributes.\n- **ARIA Roles**: Use ARIA roles to enhance accessibility.\n\n### 12. **Link Building**\n\n- **Internal Linking**: Structure your content with internal links to relevant pages within your site.\n- **External Linking**: When linking to external sites, use the `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` attribute for security.\n\nBy following these best practices, you\u2019ll create a WordPress theme that is well-optimized for search engines and provides a better user experience. Additionally, using SEO plugins can further enhance the functionality and ease of managing SEO aspects."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o-mini","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o-mini","pad":"AAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa24630-39bf-48c3-b01e-7bbcad9cfb7c","request_id":"8a582f8118dc9c8c-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa24630-39bf-48c3-b01e-7bbcad9cfb7c","children":[]}}}
