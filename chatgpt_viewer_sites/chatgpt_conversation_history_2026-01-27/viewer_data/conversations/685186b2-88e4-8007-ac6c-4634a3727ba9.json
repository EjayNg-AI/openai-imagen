After being weakened by Iraq\u2019s Sunni tribal awakening and U.S. troop surge (2007\u20132008), the group rebranded as the **Islamic State of Iraq** and later exploited the chaos of the Syrian Civil War to reconstitute itself\u301033\u2020L223-L231\u3011. In 2013 it expanded to Syria and adopted the name ISIS\u301033\u2020L230-L238\u3011. ISIS\u2019s ideology is violently **Salafi-jihadist**, aiming to establish a puritanical Sunni caliphate. It is notorious for extreme sectarianism \u2013 viewing Shia Muslims (and other minorities) as apostates \u2013 and for its brutality (e.g. grotesque beheadings and massacres) used as propaganda and intimidation\u301036\u2020L450-L458\u3011. In June 2014, ISIS captured Mosul and Tikrit, after which leader **Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi** declared a **\u201cCaliphate\u201d** spanning parts of Syria and Iraq\u301033\u2020L230-L238\u3011.\n\n**Major Activities and Timeline:** At its zenith (2014\u20132015), ISIS ruled over large swaths of eastern Syria and northern Iraq, imposing its harsh interpretation of Islamic law. It perpetrated genocide against Iraq\u2019s Yazidi minority and enslaved thousands, and orchestrated or inspired terror attacks across the globe. In 2015, the group spawned affiliates in **Libya, Egypt (Sinai), Nigeria (Boko Haram pledged allegiance), Afghanistan (ISIS-K),** and elsewhere. High-profile attacks claimed by ISIS included the bombings in **Beirut (2015)**, downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai (2015), and coordinated massacres in **Paris (Nov 2015)** and **Brussels (2016)**. A U.S.-led global coalition, together with local Kurdish, Iraqi, and Syrian forces (and also Iran-backed militias on the ground), steadily rolled back ISIS\u2019s territory. By December 2017, ISIS had lost 95% of its former territory \u2013 including its capital Raqqa and Iraq\u2019s second city, Mosul\u301033\u2020L223-L231\u3011\u301033\u2020L234-L242\u3011. Baghdadi was killed in a 2019 U.S. raid, and ISIS morphed back into an underground insurgency. Despite its territorial defeat, ISIS remains active through sleeper cells in the Middle East and franchises in Africa and South Asia.\n\n**Links to Iran:** **Iran, a Shia power, was fiercely opposed to ISIS**, a Sunni extremist movement that expressly targeted Shia communities. There is **no credible evidence of Iranian financial or logistical support to ISIS**; on the contrary, Iran actively fought ISIS. When ISIS blitzed across Iraq in 2014, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) mobilized Shia militias to defend Baghdad and Shia holy cities\u30102\u2020L55-L63\u3011. Iranian commanders (like IRGC\u2013Quds Force General Qassem Soleimani) helped Iraqi forces and militias retake territory from ISIS\u30102\u2020L59-L67\u3011. In Syria, Iran (and its proxy **Hezbollah**) likewise intervened to prop up the Assad regime against ISIS and other rebels. U.S. defense officials have noted Iran\u2019s *ambiguous* stance \u2013 Iran opposed ISIS, yet sought to leverage the ISIS threat to expand its own influence. Notably, a 2009 U.S. intelligence report cited Iran\u2019s \u201c**ambiguous role**,\u201d providing support to the new Iraqi government while **allowing weapons to reach the Taliban** (a separate Sunni insurgency) \u2013 a sign of Iran\u2019s complex regional strategy\u301029\u2020L115-L123\u3011. With ISIS, however, Iran\u2019s role was unambiguous: Tehran openly denounced ISIS as a **terrorist threat** and welcomed its defeat. Some regional adversaries (e.g. Saudi Arabia) alleged that the Iran-allied Assad regime deliberately spared ISIS early on to weaken other rebels, but such claims remain unproven. In sum, **no direct Iran\u2013ISIS cooperation** is documented; rather, Iran\u2019s IRGC and its proxies fought ISIS on the battlefield. Iranian officials frequently pointed to this fact to claim credit for fighting \u201cSunni extremism,\u201d even as the U.S. and others criticized Iran for simultaneously backing Shia militias that exacerbated sectarian tensions in Iraq\u30102\u2020L61-L69\u3011. Iran\u2019s strategy thus treated ISIS as an enemy, not an asset, and Iranian leaders continue to celebrate the collapse of ISIS\u2019s caliphate as a joint victory for Iran and its allies in the region.\n\n*(Sources: Wilson Center, Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, congressional testimony\u301033\u2020L223-L231\u3011\u301033\u2020L230-L238\u3011\u301036\u2020L450-L458\u3011\u30102\u2020L55-L63\u3011)*\n\n## Al-Qaeda\n**Origins and Ideological Underpinnings:** **Al-Qaeda** was formed in the late 1980s in the wake of the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. **Osama bin Laden** and a cadre of Arab volunteer fighters, emboldened by the Soviet withdrawal, founded al-Qaeda in 1988 as an elite vanguard to **globalize jihad**\u301036\u2020L408-L417\u3011. Bin Laden\u2019s vision was to unite disparate Islamist militant groups under one umbrella and turn their focus toward the \u201cfar enemy\u201d \u2013 particularly the United States \u2013 which he blamed for propping up corrupt regimes in Muslim lands\u301036\u2020L408-L416\u3011. Throughout the 1990s, under Bin Laden and his deputy **Ayman al-Zawahiri**, al-Qaeda developed a Salafi-jihadist ideology advocating violent jihad against both \u201cnear enemies\u201d (local governments) and \u201cfar enemies\u201d (the U.S. and Israel) in defense of the Muslim ummah. Al-Qaeda\u2019s ideology is Sunni extremist, but notably **anti-Shia** as well \u2013 although al-Qaeda often downplayed sectarian rhetoric relative to ISIS. Bin Laden saw the Shia Iranian regime as infidels, yet he was pragmatic in choosing enemies and allies.\n\n**Major Activities:** Al-Qaeda announced itself on the world stage with spectacular anti-American attacks. It was responsible for the August 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in **Kenya and Tanzania** (killing 224) and the October 2000 attack on the **USS Cole** in Yemen\u301036\u2020L422-L430\u3011. On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda carried out the deadliest terrorist attacks in history on U.S. soil, hijacking airliners to strike New York\u2019s World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing ~3,000 people. The 9/11 attacks made al-Qaeda a household name and provoked the U.S.-led \u201cWar on Terror\u201d\u301036\u2020L422-L430\u3011. The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001 toppled al-Qaeda\u2019s Taliban hosts and killed or captured many al-Qaeda members. Bin Laden evaded capture until May 2011, when U.S. Navy SEALs killed him in Pakistan. In the years after 9/11, **al-Qaeda\u2019s network expanded** through affiliates: **Al-Qaeda in Iraq** (which later broke away as ISIS), **Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)** in Yemen, **Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Northwest Africa)**, **Al-Shabaab** in Somalia (which pledged loyalty), and others. Al-Qaeda and its branches carried out numerous bombings, hostage-takings, and shootings across South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. However, intense counterterrorism pressure severely degraded the core leadership. Zawahiri, who succeeded Bin Laden, was killed by a U.S. drone in Kabul in 2022, and al-Qaeda today operates more as a diffuse network of regional franchises.\n\n**Links to Iran:** The relationship between **al-Qaeda and Iran** is **complicated and highly controversial**. On the surface, a hardline Sunni jihadist group and the revolutionary Shiite Islamic Republic are **ideological arch-foes**; indeed, al-Qaeda\u2019s propaganda often condemned Shia Iran. Yet **evidence shows a pattern of tactical cooperation** dating back to the 1990s. According to the U.S. 9/11 Commission and declassified intelligence, **Sudan** (in the early 1990s) facilitated contacts between al-Qaeda and Iran\u2019s IRGC and **Hezbollah**. **Imad Mughniyeh**, Hezbollah\u2019s top operative, reportedly met Bin Laden in the mid-1990s, and Iran\u2019s security forces allegedly provided *some training in explosives to al-Qaeda members* in Sudan and in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley\u301015\u2020L25-L34\u3011\u301015\u2020L37-L44\u3011. The **9/11 Commission** found that Iran had \u201c*facilitated the transit of al-Qaeda members into and out of Afghanistan before 9/11, and \u2026 some of these were future 9/11 hijackers*\u201d\u301011\u2020L158-L162\u3011. Notably, Iranian border officials allowed several of the 9/11 hijackers to pass through Iran (from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia) without stamping passports, presumably to conceal their travel to Afghanistan\u301011\u2020L158-L164\u3011. There is no evidence Iran had foreknowledge of 9/11, but it demonstrated a willingness to permit al-Qaeda operatives to use Iranian territory for transit. \n\nAfter 9/11, as the U.S. hunted al-Qaeda, **scores of al-Qaeda members fled into Iran**. In late 2001, Tehran **offered to open its border** to **\u201cArab volunteers\u201d** heading to Afghanistan to fight U.S. forces\u301011\u2020L160-L167\u3011. By 2002-2003, **senior al-Qaeda leaders and family members** (including Osama bin Laden\u2019s sons, Saif al-Adel \u2013 a top military chief, and Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah a.k.a. Abu Muhammad al-Masri) were detained or harbored in Iran\u301015\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u301015\u2020L79-L87\u3011. Iran\u2019s regime portrayed this as \u201chouse arrest\u201d of unwanted guests, and in 2003 it did **crack down** on al-Qaeda cells, deporting some fighters and restraining others\u301011\u2020L177-L185\u3011. However, many **key figures lived under a form of safe custody** in Iran for years \u2013 protected from U.S. capture, but also closely monitored by Iran. U.S. intelligence assessed that during the mid-2000s this Iran-based al-Qaeda network (sometimes dubbed the \u201c**Al-Qaeda Management Council**\u201d) was able to **reorganize and direct terrorist operations from Iranian soil**\u301011\u2020L169-L175\u3011. A **2015 hostage swap** confirmed the ongoing ties: Iran released several al-Qaeda leaders (including Saif al-Adel and Abu Muhammad al-Masri) in exchange for an Iranian diplomat held by al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemen affiliate\u301015\u2020L101-L109\u3011. Some of those freed relocated to Syria; others, like al-Masri, *remained in Iran*. (Al-Masri was later **assassinated in Tehran in 2020**, reportedly by Israeli agents, underscoring Iran\u2019s harboring of al-Qaeda\u2019s top echelon\u301015\u2020L125-L134\u3011.)\n\nIn recent years, **Iran\u2019s harboring of al-Qaeda\u2019s leadership has continued**. After Zawahiri\u2019s death in 2022, the **likely new emir, Saif al-Adel, is believed to be based in Iran** under the protection of the IRGC\u301015\u2020L7-L15\u3011. The UN and multiple governments have noted al-Adel\u2019s continued presence in Iran as a critical issue for al-Qaeda\u2019s future. U.S. officials (e.g. former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo) have characterized Iran as al-Qaeda\u2019s \u201c**new home base**\u201d and a core facilitation hub\u301011\u2020L117-L125\u3011\u301050\u2020L68-L74\u3011. In 2021, the U.S. Treasury revealed that **al-Qaeda used Iran as a transit and logistics base** to move operatives and money across the Middle East and South Asia\u301050\u2020L68-L74\u3011. Iranian and Hezbollah operatives allegedly served as intermediaries for al-Qaeda in some regions\u301011\u2020L139-L148\u3011. \n\nDespite this **\u201c**unlikely alliance**\u201d**, both sides deny formal cooperation. Iranian officials insist they have only detained (or expelled) al-Qaeda members, not assisted them. Al-Qaeda\u2019s leaders have been circumspect, not wanting to alienate Sunni supporters or admit reliance on Shiite Iran\u301015\u2020L7-L15\u3011. Analysts assess that Iran sees al-Qaeda as a **tool of convenience** \u2013 useful to harass U.S. forces in Afghanistan or Iraq, or to influence Sunni jihadist battlefields, but too dangerous to fully unleash. For al-Qaeda, refuge in Iran has been a **desperate lifeline** during times of U.S. pressure\u301011\u2020L149-L157\u3011. This **transactional relationship** is characterized by mutual mistrust: Iran reportedly imposed limits on al-Qaeda activities from its soil, while at times imprisoning or deporting members to gain leverage or goodwill (for example, briefly cooperating with the U.S. in 2003 by arresting some operatives\u301011\u2020L177-L185\u3011). Still, the **evidence of direct links is significant**: U.S. courts (e.g. the *Cabrera v. Iran* case) have ruled that Iran materially aided al-Qaeda by sheltering its leaders and facilitating travel\u301050\u2020L75-L83\u3011. In summary, **Iran\u2019s ties to al-Qaeda have been opportunistic and opaque** \u2013 a marriage of convenience against common enemies (the U.S. and its allies), rather than a deep ideological alliance. Both Tehran and al-Qaeda\u2019s Sunni extremists publicly downplay their collusion, yet over the past three decades Iran repeatedly provided *\u201ccritical life support\u201d* to al-Qaeda when it suited Tehran\u2019s interests\u301011\u2020L149-L157\u3011.\n\n*(Sources: Brookings Institution, Lawfare, 9/11 Commission Report, FDD/Long War Journal investigations, U.S. Treasury and court documents\u301011\u2020L158-L162\u3011\u301015\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u301050\u2020L59-L67\u3011\u301050\u2020L68-L74\u3011)*\n\n## Hezbollah \n**Formation and Ideology:** **Hezbollah** (Arabic for \u201cParty of God\u201d) is a Shiite Islamist militant group and political party based in Lebanon. It was formed during the Lebanese Civil War, notably **in 1982** in response to Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon. A faction of Lebanese Shi\u2019a militants, influenced and aided by Iran\u2019s newly-established Islamic Revolutionary government, coalesced to form Hezbollah\u301021\u2020L328-L337\u3011. Iran\u2019s **Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)** deployed to Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley in the early 1980s to train and arm these militants; with Iranian funding and guidance, the *\u201cbudding militia\u201d* adopted the name Hezbollah\u301021\u2020L328-L336\u3011. Hezbollah\u2019s 1985 manifesto explicitly **pledged allegiance to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader** and embraced the doctrine of Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini (wilayat al-faqih, or guardianship of the Islamic jurist)\u301021\u2020L339-L347\u3011. The group\u2019s core ideology is staunchly **anti-Israel and anti-Western**. Hezbollah presents itself as a \u201cresistance\u201d movement defending Lebanon and the Muslim world from Israeli aggression and Western imperialism. It also harbors the long-term goal of establishing an Islamic order in Lebanon, though it pragmatically operates within Lebanon\u2019s multi-sectarian political system. Importantly, Hezbollah is **Iran\u2019s closest proxy**: it subscribes to Shia Islamist ideology and views Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader as its ultimate religious authority\u301021\u2020L341-L347\u3011. This ideological alignment has underpinned a tight relationship wherein Iran provides patronage and Hezbollah furthers Iran\u2019s regional agenda.\n\n**Key Figures and Structure:** Hezbollah\u2019s early leaders included **Sheikh Subhi al-Tufayli** and **Abbas al-Musawi**, but since 1992 it has been led by **Hassan Nasrallah** \u2013 under whose leadership Hezbollah grew into a formidable force. Nasrallah (killed in 2024 per recent reports\u301017\u2020L229-L237\u3011) became the charismatic face of Hezbollah, helping transform it from a shadowy militia into a powerful quasi-state entity. The organization has a political wing (which holds seats in Lebanon\u2019s parliament and cabinet) and a military wing (the **Islamic Resistance**). It also runs extensive social services, schools, and media \u2013 making it a \u201cstate within a state\u201d in Shiite areas of Lebanon\u301017\u2020L268-L277\u3011. \n\n**Major Activities and Timeline:** During the 1980s, Hezbollah earned infamy for attacks on Western targets in Lebanon, allegedly with Iranian direction. **In 1983**, Hezbollah operatives (with IRGC support) carried out suicide truck bombings against the U.S. Marine barracks and French paratrooper barracks in Beirut, killing 299 U.S. and French personnel\u301021\u2020L331-L338\u3011. Hezbollah (or its predecessor cells like Islamic Jihad Organization) was also blamed for the 1984 U.S. Embassy annex bombing in Beirut and the kidnapping of dozens of Western hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. Throughout the 1990s, Hezbollah fought an insurgency against Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon, eventually *forcing Israel\u2019s withdrawal in 2000*, which boosted Hezbollah\u2019s prestige. Outside Lebanon, Hezbollah is accused of the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center (AMIA) in Buenos Aires and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia (the latter targeting U.S. Air Force personnel), though it denies involvement. In **2006**, Hezbollah fought a **34-day war with Israel** after a cross-border raid. Hezbollah fired thousands of rockets into northern Israel while Israel bombarded Lebanon; the war ended inconclusively but at great cost to Lebanon\u2019s infrastructure. In the 2010s, Hezbollah intervened heavily in **Syria\u2019s civil war** on Iran\u2019s behalf. Starting in 2012\u20132013, Hezbollah deployed thousands of fighters to Syria to prop up Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, playing a crucial role (along with IRGC and Russia) in turning the tide against Syrian rebel forces\u301039\u2020L512-L520\u3011\u301039\u2020L514-L523\u3011. This expedition came at a price: Hezbollah took significant casualties and alienated many Sunnis (who opposed Assad), but it **gained battle-hardened experience** and new weaponry. By 2019, Hezbollah began partially withdrawing fighters from Syria after shoring up Assad\u301039\u2020L514-L522\u3011. Today, Hezbollah possesses an arsenal of an estimated 100,000+ rockets and missiles (supplied largely by Iran) threatening Israel, and has been entangled in periodic skirmishes with Israel even as it also faces criticism at home for dragging Lebanon into conflicts\u301039\u2020L528-L537\u3011\u301039\u2020L538-L546\u3011. Most recently, during the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war, Hezbollah launched limited attacks on northern Israel \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Hamas, raising fears of a broader war orchestrated by Iran\u301039\u2020L597-L605\u3011.\n\n**Direct Links to Iran:** Hezbollah is often cited as **\u201cRevolutionary Iran\u2019s most successful export\u201d**, epitomizing Iran\u2019s strategy of projecting power via proxy militias\u301016\u2020L25-L32\u3011. The evidence of Iran\u2019s role in Hezbollah\u2019s rise and operations is abundant and explicit. **Iran\u2019s IRGC founded Hezbollah** \u2013 IRGC officers trained the first Hezbollah fighters in the Bekaa Valley in 1982\u201384, and **Iran provided funds, arms, and advisers** to the group from its inception\u301021\u2020L328-L336\u3011. Hezbollah\u2019s own manifesto and leaders openly acknowledge ideological fealty to Iran. Over the decades, Iran has reportedly supplied Hezbollah with advanced weapons: everything from rifles and RPGs to long-range missiles and attack drones have been funneled via Syria. A U.S. State Department report estimated Iran gives Hezbollah **~$700 million annually** in financial support in recent years\u301031\u2020L131-L139\u3011, enabling its expansive armed network. Iranian military officers (from the IRGC\u2013Quds Force) act as liaisons and consultants to Hezbollah; for example, IRGC General **HosseIN Dehghan** was among the early commanders aiding Hezbollah in the 1980s. Iran often uses Hezbollah to train or assist other militias (e.g. in Iraq and Yemen), effectively making Hezbollah a regional proxy handler on Tehran\u2019s behalf\u301021\u2020L331-L338\u3011. Hezbollah in turn has acted as Iran\u2019s arm: conducting the 1992 and 1994 bombings in Argentina (according to Argentine and Israeli intelligence) as retaliation against Israel, assassinating Syrian dissidents, and attempting attacks on Israeli targets abroad (Cyprus, Thailand, etc.) at Iran\u2019s behest. During the Syrian war, Iran deployed Hezbollah as an expeditionary force to keep the Assad regime (Iran\u2019s ally) in power\u301039\u2020L507-L515\u3011\u301039\u2020L514-L522\u3011. The **Hezbollah\u2013Iran relationship is formalized** to an unusual degree: Hezbollah\u2019s Shura Council consults with Iranian officials, and Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Khamenei sends a personal representative to Beirut. In exchange for Iran\u2019s patronage, Hezbollah largely hews to Tehran\u2019s strategic direction (though tactical disagreements have occurred). \n\nIranian officials proudly tout Hezbollah as a **\u201cresistance\u201d partner**. Conversely, the U.S. and many governments consider Hezbollah *wholly reliant on Iran*. For instance, a 2020 U.S. military report stated: *\u201cHezbollah serves as Iran\u2019s proxy, its most powerful terrorist partner\u201d*\u301017\u2020L225-L233\u3011. Even within Lebanon, opponents accuse Hezbollah of \u201cacting as Iran\u2019s agent\u201d rather than a purely Lebanese actor. Notably, Hezbollah\u2019s weapons and logistics pipeline runs through Iran\u2019s ally Syria; Tehran and Damascus facilitate massive arms transfers to Hezbollah\u301039\u2020L502-L509\u3011. United Nations reports have documented violations of the arms embargo on Hezbollah, tracing them to Iran. Hezbollah\u2019s own leader Nasrallah repeatedly thanks Iran for enabling the group\u2019s military strength, saying in 2016: *\u201cI will not shy away from mentioning the support of the Islamic Republic of Iran in terms of weapons, funding and training\u201d*. Iranian state media often refers to Hezbollah fighters killed in Syria as \u201cmartyrs\u201d for the Islamic Revolution, underlining the ideological bond.\n\nIn terms of **command and control**, analysts describe Hezbollah as **\u201cIran\u2019s forward arm\u201d**. However, Hezbollah does maintain a degree of autonomy in Lebanese politics \u2013 it must balance its domestic standing with loyalty to Iran. There have been moments (such as internal Lebanese matters or brief engagement with domestic opponents) where Hezbollah\u2019s decisions reflected local interests. But on issues of war and peace (especially vis-\u00e0-vis Israel), Hezbollah coordinates closely with Iran. For example, the timing and rules of engagement of Hezbollah\u2019s actions against Israel often align with Tehran\u2019s calculus (e.g. not provoking an all-out war unless Iran green-lights it). Western and Arab intelligence have implicated Iran and Hezbollah together in numerous covert operations, from bomb plots in Europe and Asia to training Iraqi Shia militias that attacked U.S. troops in Iraq in the 2000s.\n\nIn summary, **Hezbollah is incontrovertibly linked to Iran** \u2013 it is *the* paradigm of an Iranian proxy. Iran\u2019s financial and military sponsorship, ideological mentorship, and strategic tasking of Hezbollah have been affirmed by **U.S. government reports, Lebanese officials, and even Hezbollah\u2019s own statements**\u301021\u2020L328-L336\u3011\u301017\u2020L225-L233\u3011. While Hezbollah has evolved (now also a political party governing parts of Lebanon), **Iran\u2019s role remains foundational**, ensuring Hezbollah stays equipped and aligned with Tehran\u2019s regional objectives. Officially, Iran dismisses the term \u201cproxy,\u201d claiming Hezbollah is an independent \u201cresistance movement\u201d; but Tehran openly celebrates Hezbollah\u2019s battlefield victories as its own. The **state-level sponsorship** here is direct: Iran is under U.S. and international sanctions precisely for arming and funding Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. The Iranian government, particularly the IRGC\u2019s Quds Force, effectively *created, and continues to sustain, Hezbollah*\u301021\u2020L328-L336\u3011. Without Iran, Hezbollah would likely not exist in its current form, and certainly would not wield such outsized influence. This symbiosis is perhaps the clearest case of post-Cold War state-sponsored terrorism, with Iran and Hezbollah denying none of it \u2013 instead, they frame it as an alliance against Israel and Western \u201caggression.\u201d\n\n*(Sources: Council on Foreign Relations, CFR Backgrounder updated 2024\u301021\u2020L328-L336\u3011\u301021\u2020L331-L338\u3011; Hezbollah 1985 Open Letter; U.S. State Dept Country Reports on Terrorism; Washington Institute analyses; United Nations reports)*\n\n\u301046\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Hezbollah fighters displaying the group\u2019s yellow flag during a parade in Beirut.

Its official name is *Jama\u2019atu Ahlis Sunnah Lidda\u2019awati wal-Jihad* (\u201cPeople Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet\u2019s Teachings and Jihad\u201d), but it became known as \u201cBoko Haram,\u201d which in the local Hausa language means \u201cWestern education is forbidden.\u201d The group was founded around **2002** in Maiduguri, northeast Nigeria, by a charismatic cleric **Mohammed Yusuf**. Boko Haram emerged in a milieu of poor governance, economic hardship, and religious tension in northern Nigeria. Yusuf preached against corruption and Western influence, advocating a strict **Salafi-Islamic way of life** and the imposition of Sharia law. Early on, the sect was relatively quietist, establishing a commune and school. However, **in July 2009 Nigerian security forces cracked down** on the group, killing Yusuf and hundreds of followers. After Yusuf\u2019s death (in police custody), his deputy **Abubakar Shekau** assumed leadership and transformed Boko Haram into a highly violent insurgency.\n\n**Major Activities and Evolution:** From 2010 onward, Boko Haram launched a campaign of bombings, mass shootings, and kidnappings, primarily in Nigeria\u2019s northeast. It targeted police, military, government offices, schools, churches, and civilians\u2014killing tens of thousands over a decade. Notorious incidents include the **August 2011 suicide bombing of the UN headquarters in Abuja**, the January 2012 coordinated attacks in Kano that killed almost 200, and the abduction of 276 schoolgirls from **Chibok** in April 2014, which sparked global outrage. By 2014, Boko Haram seized control of a swath of territory in Borno and adjoining states, declaring a **\u201cIslamic caliphate\u201d** in areas like Gwoza. In March 2015, Shekau **pledged allegiance to ISIS**, and Boko Haram began calling itself the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cWest Africa Province\u201d (ISWAP)\u301024\u2020L31-L39\u3011. This led to a split: in 2016 a faction broke away (led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi) with ISIS\u2019s backing, becoming ISWAP, while Shekau\u2019s faction continued independently (often still dubbed Boko Haram). Boko Haram became infamously brutal, employing suicide bombers (including young girls) in mosques and markets, and massacring entire villages. Regional military offensives by Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and Niger gradually pushed Boko Haram out of its strongholds by 2017, though at a heavy cost. Shekau proved elusive until May 2021, when he reportedly killed himself to avoid capture by the rival ISWAP faction. Since then, Boko Haram\u2019s activity has waned, while ISWAP (the splinter aligned with ISIS) remains active around Lake Chad. The insurgency has created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises, with over 2 million displaced.\n\n**Links to Iran:** **Boko Haram\u2019s roots and ideology are Salafi-jihadist and anti-Shiite**, and it arose in the context of Sunni militancy in Nigeria \u2013 thus **direct linkages to Iran (a Shia regime) are not evident.** Unlike groups in the Middle East, Boko Haram\u2019s connections have been primarily with Sunni extremist networks (al-Qaeda and later ISIS) rather than Iran. Over the years, investigations have uncovered Boko Haram ties to **al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)** and training exchanges with groups in Mali and Somalia, but **no credible funding or training from Iran**. In fact, Boko Haram\u2019s rhetoric condemns Western influence and the secular Nigerian state, rather than focusing on sectarian issues (the group generally targeted Christians and Nigerian security forces; it **did not overtly attack Shia minorities in Nigeria** in its early years)\u301024\u2020L47-L54\u3011. Given Boko Haram\u2019s vehemently Sunni fundamentalist outlook, **ideological alignment with Iran\u2019s Shia revolutionary government is essentially absent**.\n\nThat said, there have been a few **murky incidents and allegations** that raised questions about Iran\u2019s role in Nigeria\u2019s militant scene \u2013 though these mostly involve **Nigerian Shia organizations or Iran\u2019s covert units, not Boko Haram**. One oft-cited event was the 2010 arrest in Nigeria of an Iranian Quds Force operative shipping a container of weapons to Nigeria (in violation of UN sanctions). Those arms were allegedly intended for **Shia militants in Nigeria or Gambia**, not for Boko Haram. Another incident occurred in **May 2013**, when Nigeria\u2019s Joint Task Force raided a residence in Kano owned by a Lebanese national and discovered a hidden arms cache (including rockets and landmines). Nigerian authorities announced they had uncovered a local **Hezbollah cell** and suggested **\u201cBoko Haram Islamist militants have connections with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah\u201d**\u301027\u2020L59-L67\u3011. The arrested Lebanese suspects confessed to Hezbollah training, and officials indicated the weapons were likely meant for attacking Israeli or Western interests in Nigeria\u301027\u2020L93-L100\u3011. However, security analysts noted that this Hezbollah cell appeared separate from Boko Haram\u2019s operations \u2013 essentially, **two distinct forms of militancy co-existing in Nigeria** (one driven by transnational Shia networks, the other by local Sunni jihadism). The Nigerian military\u2019s statement linking Boko Haram to Hezbollah was not backed by public evidence of joint operations; it may have been referencing anecdotally that **some Nigerian Muslims had interacted with both movements**. In fact, one **former Boko Haram fighter claimed** he had first been part of an \u201cIslamic movement called \u2018the Shia\u2019 that sent members to Iran for training\u201d before joining a Boko Haram cell\u301024\u2020L49-L54\u3011. This suggests a *personal* trajectory (a recruit moving from a pro-Iranian Shia movement to Boko Haram), rather than institutional collusion. \n\nOverall, **no reliable documentation indicates Iranian state support for Boko Haram**. U.S. State Department and UK reports on terrorism have not identified Iran as a financier or sponsor of Boko Haram. On the contrary, Boko Haram\u2019s funding is believed to come from local criminal activities (bank robberies, extortion, kidnapping for ransom) and possibly donations from Gulf-based jihadist sympathizers \u2013 not Iran. Indeed, **Iran and Boko Haram stand on opposite sides of the Sunni\u2013Shia divide**, and Boko Haram\u2019s allegiance to ISIS (which is virulently anti-Iran and anti-Shia) further underscores the lack of alignment. During the period when Boko Haram was ascendant, **Iran\u2019s focus in Africa** regarding militancy was more on supporting Shia movements such as the **Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN)** led by Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky, who openly espoused Khomeini\u2019s ideology. In a way, the rise of Boko Haram (Sunni jihadism) and the growth of the IMN (Shia activism) represented rival influences in Nigeria. There have been deadly clashes **between Boko Haram and the Nigerian Shia community** on a few occasions, but Boko Haram mostly viewed the Nigerian secular government and Christians as its primary enemies, rather than engaging in sectarian war.\n\nIran\u2019s official stance on Boko Haram has been one of condemnation. Tehran has **publicly condemned Boko Haram\u2019s terrorism**, especially its abduction of schoolgirls and attacks on Muslims and Christians. Iran has attempted to build relations with the Nigerian government and would have little to gain by empowering a Sunni extremist rebellion that destabilizes an oil-rich African state. Nigerian authorities, for their part, have been cautious not to frame Boko Haram\u2019s insurgency in Sunni-Shia terms, focusing instead on its domestic roots. \n\nIn summary, **Boko Haram and Iran have no known direct relationship**. The **only tangential links** have been: (1) Iranian intelligence operations in Nigeria targeting different foes (Israel/West or supporting Nigerian Shias), which briefly overlapped geographically with Boko Haram\u2019s theater; and (2) a few Nigerians switching from Iranian-backed groups to Boko Haram, indicating complex personal ties in Nigeria\u2019s religious landscape\u301024\u2020L49-L54\u3011. But **no evidence** suggests Iran funded, trained, or armed Boko Haram. Indeed, Boko Haram\u2019s later alignment with ISIS placed it firmly in an anti-Iran camp. Multiple governments \u2013 including Nigeria\u2019s and its neighbors \u2013 have **accused Boko Haram of many horrors, but not of being an Iranian proxy**. Accusations of state sponsorship have instead focused on other sources (e.g. some have speculated support from wealthy individuals in Gulf states). Iran\u2019s proxy strategy in the Muslim world largely centers on empowering Shia or co-sectarian actors; Boko Haram does not fit that mold. Thus, on the question of Iranian linkages: **the evidence is essentially negative \u2013 a confirmation that Boko Haram\u2019s rise was indigenous and Sunni-driven, without Iranian hand**.\n\n*(Sources: Combating Terrorism Center at West Point analysis\u301024\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301024\u2020L47-L54\u3011; Nigerian JTF press release via media\u301027\u2020L59-L67\u3011\u301027\u2020L93-L100\u3011; U.S. State Dept reports; academic research by Jacob Zenn and others.)*\n\n## The Taliban\n**Formation and Rule (1994\u20132001):** The **Taliban** are an Islamist movement that originated in southern **Afghanistan**. They arose in 1994 amid the chaos of Afghanistan\u2019s post-Soviet civil war. The word \u201cTaliban\u201d means \u201cstudents\u201d \u2013 many early members were Afghan refugees or orphans educated in conservative Deobandi Sunni madrasas in Pakistan. **Mullah Mohammad Omar**, a cleric from Kandahar, organized a group of pious but battle-hardened Pashtun students to combat warlordism and instill order via strict **Sharia law**. The Taliban rapidly expanded, capturing Kandahar in late 1994, then Herat (1995), and eventually Kabul in September 1996. They declared the **Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan**, with Mullah Omar as \u201cAmir al-Mu\u2019minin\u201d (Commander of the Faithful). The Taliban regime imposed an extreme interpretation of Islamic law \u2013 banning most female education and employment, enforcing beard length and dress codes, and carrying out harsh punishments. Their ideology is often described as **Deobandi fundamentalism mixed with Pashtun tribal customs**, distinct from al-Qaeda\u2019s global jihadism (the Taliban\u2019s focus was mostly internal: to establish an Islamic state in Afghanistan). By 2001, the Taliban controlled about 90% of Afghanistan\u2019s territory, though their rule was recognized formally by only three countries (Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, UAE).\n\nDuring their rule, the Taliban gave sanctuary to **Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda**, who had relocated to Afghanistan in 1996. Despite requests, the Taliban refused to hand over Bin Laden after al-Qaeda\u2019s 9/11 attacks, directly leading to the U.S.-led invasion in October 2001 that **toppled the Taliban regime**.\n\n**Insurgency and Return to Power:** After 2001, the Taliban regrouped as an insurgency, with **Pakistan\u2019s border areas** serving as rear bases. Over a 20-year guerrilla campaign, they sought to expel NATO and U.S. forces and overthrow the U.S.-backed Afghan government. The Taliban insurgency (led at times by Mullah Omar until his 2013 death, then by Mullah Akhtar Mansour, and later by Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada) carried out relentless bombings, ambushes, and assassinations. By the late 2000s, the Taliban had shadow governors in many provinces and threatened much of Afghanistan\u2019s rural areas, although they could not capture major cities while foreign troops remained. After the U.S. began negotiating with the Taliban, a peace deal was signed in February 2020 setting the stage for an American withdrawal. In August 2021, the **Taliban astoundingly swept back to power**, seizing Kabul as the U.S.-trained Afghan army melted away. They re-established the Islamic Emirate. Thus, the Taliban is unique among the groups discussed: it evolved from non-state militia to *de facto* state power (twice). The Taliban\u2019s second regime (2021\u2013present) once again imposed ultra-conservative Islamic rules (severely curtailing women\u2019s rights and eliminating secular education for girls) and has faced international isolation and sanctions.\n\n**Ideological Outlook:** The Taliban\u2019s ideology is Sunni **Islamist and neo-fundamentalist**, rooted in the Deobandi school (influenced by Wahhabi-like austerity). It is *not* explicitly expansionist beyond Afghanistan, unlike al-Qaeda or ISIS. The Taliban have historically been **deeply anti-Shia** in practice \u2013 viewing the Shia minority (especially ethnic Hazaras) as heretical. This led to *massacres of Shia civilians* under Taliban rule, most infamously in 1998 in Mazar-i-Sharif, where Taliban fighters killed thousands of Hazaras and also **murdered 9 Iranian diplomats** and a journalist at the Iranian consulate\u301041\u2020L137-L146\u3011\u301041\u2020L139-L148\u3011. That incident brought **Iran and the Taliban to the brink of war** in 1998; Tehran massed troops on the border and only refrained from invading after UN mediation\u301041\u2020L141-L149\u3011. Thus, in the 1990s, **Iran considered the Taliban a hostile enemy** \u2013 a **Sunni extremist regime persecuting Shia** and allied to Pakistan (Iran\u2019s rival) and hosting al-Qaeda. The deep antagonism was mutual: the Taliban denounced Iran\u2019s Shia theocracy as un-Islamic, and clashes occurred along the Iran-Afghan border. For example, aside from the diplomat murders, the Taliban in 2000 razed Bamyan\u2019s ancient Buddha statues (an act partly motivated by spite toward Shia Hazaras and done despite Iranian appeals).\n\n**Links to Iran \u2013 Early Enmity and Later Pragmatism:** Given this history, one might assume **Iran and the Taliban would never collaborate**. Indeed, during the Taliban\u2019s first regime (1996\u20132001), Iran actively **backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance**, providing arms and funding to Tajik and Hazara militias fighting the Pashtun-dominated Taliban. Iran nearly went to war with the Taliban in 1998 after the Mazar-i-Sharif killings\u301041\u2020L139-L148\u3011\u301041\u2020L169-L177\u3011. However, **after 2001**, geopolitical realities prompted a **shift**. The U.S. military presence in Afghanistan was a common enemy for both Iran and the ousted Taliban. **Iran quietly began to engage the Taliban insurgency** as a **hedge against the U.S.** and the influence of ISIS and other threats. By the mid-2000s, reports emerged (from NATO and Afghan officials) that **Iran was supplying the Taliban with weapons, training, and funding** in a limited but notable capacity\u301029\u2020L115-L123\u3011\u301042\u2020L142-L150\u3011. This was paradoxical \u2013 Iran was also cooperating with the new Afghan government it publicly supported \u2013 but Iran was playing a \u201c**double game**,\u201d as U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates put it\u301029\u2020L119-L123\u3011. General Stanley McChrystal\u2019s 2009 report noted Iran was providing development aid to Afghanistan\u2019s government *and* \u201callowing support to the Taliban\u201d simultaneously\u301029\u2020L115-L123\u3011.\n\nEvidence of **Iran\u2019s covert aid to Taliban insurgents** includes: **interdicted shipments of Iranian-made arms** (such as explosively-formed penetrators, EFPs, and surface-to-air missiles) destined for the Taliban\u301029\u2020L115-L123\u3011; the presence of Taliban cadres in **Iranian territory**; and the activities of the IRGC\u2019s elite Quds Force. For example, in 2007 British forces intercepted a convoy in Herat province carrying Iranian arms to the Taliban. In 2010, the U.S. Treasury designated two IRGC-Quds Force officers for arranging lethal aid (including roadside bombs) to Taliban commanders. According to declassified U.S. intelligence and Afghan officials, **Iran\u2019s Quds Force established training camps for Taliban fighters on Iranian soil** (e.g. in Kerman and Zahedan), and **Taliban fighters received combat training from IRGC instructors** before re-entering Afghanistan\u301050\u2020L59-L67\u3011. Iranian agents also allegedly paid bounties for each U.S. soldier the Taliban killed (as per some Afghan intelligence reports in 2012). By providing such support, Iran pursued **multiple objectives**: eroding the U.S./NATO position next door, gaining leverage over the Taliban\u2019s future behavior, and defending Iran\u2019s own interests in western Afghanistan. Indeed, Iran cultivated especially strong ties with Taliban factions operating near Iran\u2019s border (Herat/Farah provinces), even as it continued to oppose hardcore anti-Shia Taliban elements.\n\nThe **depth of Iran-Taliban ties** grew such that by the late 2010s, Russia and Iran were both informally aiding the Taliban as a counterweight to ISIS\u2019s Afghan branch (ISIS-K) and in anticipation of an American withdrawal. In 2015, Afghan and Western officials confirmed that Iran had **Taliban leaders living in Mashhad** and occasionally supplying them with drones and night-vision equipment. Iran also hosted Taliban delegations for secret talks. This culminated after the Taliban\u2019s return to power: in **February 2023, Iran formally handed the Afghan Embassy in Tehran to the Taliban\u2019s appointed diplomats**, effectively recognizing the Taliban government to a degree\u301042\u2020L124-L132\u3011\u301042\u2020L126-L134\u3011. By then, **the enmity of the 1990s had morphed into pragmatic engagement**. Iran and the Taliban now coordinate on trade, border security, and water rights \u2013 albeit amid mutual distrust (border skirmishes still occur, e.g. a deadly clash over water in 2023). It\u2019s a startling turnabout: the same Iran that nearly invaded Afghanistan to fight the Taliban now maintains cordial if uneasy ties with the Taliban regime.\n\nHowever, Iran\u2019s influence on the Taliban should not be overstated. The Taliban remain fundamentally Sunni fundamentalists with their own independent power base. Tensions persist, particularly over the Taliban\u2019s treatment of Shia Hazaras (attacks on Hazara mosques by the Taliban or ISIS-K worry Tehran) and over shared water resources (the Helmand River dispute). Iran has pressed the Taliban to form an inclusive government and respect Shia minority rights, but with little success. In 2022\u20132023, firefights erupted on the Iran-Afghan border, showing the relationship is far from an alliance.\n\n**State-Level Sponsorship and Accusations:** Despite the new Taliban-Iran modus vivendi, **Iran\u2019s earlier support to the Taliban insurgency is well documented**. The U.S. and Afghan governments repeatedly accused Iran of arming the Taliban as a state sponsor of terrorism. For instance, a 2017 U.S. military report stated Iran\u2019s **IRGC was \u201cproviding money, training, and weapons to the Taliban\u201d**, including facilitating Taliban leaders\u2019 sanctuary in Iran\u301050\u2020L59-L67\u3011. In 2020, the U.S. Treasury went further, naming an al-Qaeda operative in Iran as a link between Iran and Taliban\u2019s Haqqani faction. Iran usually **denied these claims**, calling them \u201cbaseless propaganda.\u201d Iranian officials admitted to \u201ccontacts\u201d with the Taliban but said these were to protect Iran\u2019s interests (like safeguarding Shiites and encouraging peace talks) rather than to aid attacks on Americans. Nonetheless, evidence such as the U.S. District Court judgment in *Cabrera vs. Iran* \u2013 which reviewed classified info and concluded Iran **\u201cprovided material support to the Taliban and al-Qaeda causing deaths of U.S. soldiers\u201d** \u2013 underscores that Iran did play a covert role in the Taliban\u2019s war against U.S./NATO forces\u301050\u2020L75-L83\u3011. According to that court, IRGC-Quds Force units (specifically the Ansar Corps based near Afghanistan) were instrumental in assisting Taliban insurgents\u301050\u2020L59-L67\u3011.\n\nIn sum, the **Iran\u2013Taliban relationship has evolved from fierce hostility to cautious cooperation** over 25 years. During the Taliban\u2019s first regime and the early U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, Iran\u2019s stance was aggressively anti-Taliban. But as geopolitical winds changed, Iran shifted to a **\u201ctactical alliance\u201d** with elements of the Taliban \u2013 enough to bleed U.S. forces and ensure Iran wasn\u2019t encircled by U.S. allies\u301050\u2020L59-L67\u3011. Now that the Taliban are in power again, Iran seeks a stable neighbor it can work with (better the Taliban, Tehran figures, than chaos or ISIS-K). Iran provides electricity and fuel to Afghanistan and engages the Taliban diplomatically\u301042\u2020L142-L150\u3011\u301042\u2020L144-L153\u3011. Yet deep suspicions remain \u2013 rooted in sectarian difference and historical bloodshed. The Taliban, for their part, balance their ties with Iran against their ties with Pakistan and Gulf states. They occasionally voice support for Iran against U.S./Israel (for example, **the Taliban condemned Israeli strikes on Iran in 2025**, an unusual public siding with Tehran\u301050\u2020L21-L29\u3011\u301050\u2020L59-L67\u3011). Such gestures signal a **marriage of convenience**: Iran and the Taliban will cooperate against common foes (like ISIS or Israel/U.S.) while carefully managing the ideological chasm between them\u301050\u2020L53-L61\u3011. Iranian state media now downplays past animosity and emphasizes Muslim unity, but neither side forgets the others\u2019 true nature. Therefore, **Iran\u2019s linkage to the Taliban can be characterized as indirect, covert support born out of realpolitik rather than genuine alignment**, with Iran at times a sponsor of Taliban militants, and now a begrudging neighbor trying to influence Taliban governance from the outside.\n\n*(Sources: Human Rights Watch; Anadolu Agency\u301041\u2020L137-L146\u3011\u301041\u2020L139-L148\u3011; CTC West Point\u301029\u2020L115-L123\u3011; Washington Institute policy analysis\u301042\u2020L142-L150\u3011; Long War Journal investigations\u301050\u2020L59-L67\u3011; U.S. government reports and Treasury sanctions)*\n\n## Hamas\n**Background and Formation:** **Hamas** (an acronym for *Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya*, or Islamic Resistance Movement) is a Palestinian Sunni Islamist organization operating primarily in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. While Hamas was founded in **December 1987** \u2013 slightly before the end of the Cold War \u2013 its evolution and prominence largely occurred in the post-Cold War period, making it a major group to consider. Hamas emerged at the start of the **First Intifada** (Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation) as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. Its founding leaders, notably **Sheikh Ahmed Yassin**, envisioned a movement that combined Palestinian nationalist goals with political Islam. Hamas\u2019s 1988 charter called for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in historic Palestine. The group quickly gained popularity through a network of da\u2019wah (social/religious outreach) institutions \u2013 schools, charities, clinics \u2013 alongside its armed activities.\n\n**Ideology and Structure:** Hamas is ideologically Sunni Islamist (Muslim Brotherhood lineage), emphasizing jihad against Israeli occupation. It fuses Palestinian nationalism with Islamist rhetoric, describing all of Palestine as an Islamic trust (waqf) that cannot be relinquished. Initially, Hamas\u2019s stance toward Shia Iran was cautious due to sectarian and geopolitical differences (Iran was then closely allied with Yasser Arafat\u2019s secular Fatah during the 1980s). Over time, Hamas pragmatically developed ties with any state willing to support the Palestinian cause, including Iran. Hamas has a political bureau (historically headquartered in exile in places like Damascus and Doha) and a military wing, the **Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades**. Key figures have included co-founders Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi (both assassinated by Israel in 2004), long-time political chief **Khaled Mashal**, and current Gaza leaders **Ismail Haniyeh** and **Yahya Sinwar**.\n\n**Major Activities and Timeline:** Hamas became known in the 1990s for a campaign of **suicide bombings** inside Israel \u2013 especially during the Oslo peace process, which Hamas opposed. Notable attacks (1994\u20131997) targeted buses, cafes, and markets, killing scores of Israeli civilians. During the Second Intifada (2000\u20132005), Hamas carried out some of the deadliest bombings, solidifying its reputation as a leading resistance faction. In **2006**, Hamas surprised observers by winning the Palestinian legislative elections (defeating the Fatah party). This led to a brief unity government, then a violent rift: in June 2007, Hamas took control of **Gaza** by force, ousting Fatah officials. Since 2007, Hamas has governed the Gaza Strip, while the Palestinian Authority (under Fatah) administers parts of the West Bank. Under siege conditions in Gaza, Hamas and Israel have fought multiple **wars**: major escalations occurred in **2008-09 (Operation Cast Lead)**, **2012**, **2014 (50-day war)**, and beyond. Hamas\u2019s tactics include firing rockets (often indiscriminately) into Israeli cities and digging cross-border tunnels for attacks or abductions (e.g., the 2006 capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit). Israel\u2019s military responses have caused heavy damage in Gaza. The cycle of conflict has been recurrent, with truces mediated by regional powers.\n\nIn **October 2023**, Hamas launched its most audacious operation: a surprise large-scale attack from Gaza into southern Israel (killing around 1,200 Israelis and taking >200 hostages). This unprecedented assault triggered a massive Israeli retaliation and a new Gaza war. Western and Israeli officials suggested such a complex operation likely involved **Iran\u2019s hand**, which brings us to Hamas\u2019s relationship with Iran.\n\n**Linkages to Iran:** **Iran has been a major sponsor of Hamas for decades**, particularly after the mid-1990s and increasingly in the 2000s. This might seem counter-intuitive \u2013 Hamas is Sunni and was initially aligned with the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood, whereas Iran\u2019s regime is Shiite and had historically supported Shia groups like Hezbollah. However, **Iran has embraced Sunni militants when it serves Iran\u2019s anti-Israel and anti-U.S. agenda**. By the early 1990s, Iran saw the Palestinian cause as a way to gain pan-Islamic legitimacy and to bleed Israel. After 1991, as secular PLO leaders engaged in U.S.-brokered peace talks, Iran **forged relations with rejectionist groups**: Hamas and the smaller **Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)**. Iran provided these groups with financial aid, weapons, and training to bolster armed resistance against Israel\u301031\u2020L41-L49\u3011\u301031\u2020L51-L58\u3011.\n\nThroughout the Second Intifada, Israeli intelligence reported that **Iran (via the IRGC-Quds Force and Hezbollah) was transferring funds and technical know-how to Hamas** for making bombs and longer-range rockets. A key turning point came after Hamas\u2019s 2006 election victory: when much of the West cut off funding to Hamas, **Iran stepped in as a key financier**. Iran allegedly gave Hamas tens of millions of dollars annually. By 2008, Hamas leaders were openly visiting Tehran. Iranian-supplied **Fajr-5 artillery rockets** began appearing in Hamas\u2019s arsenal \u2013 these longer-range rockets (smuggled via Sudan/Egypt or directly shipped to Gaza before Egypt\u2019s crackdown) enabled Hamas to reach Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in the 2012 conflict. In a 2012 speech, Hamas\u2019s Gaza prime minister Ismail Haniyeh thanked Iran for arms and funds that enabled Hamas to \u201chit the Tel Aviv occupation\u201d with rockets.\n\nHowever, there was a brief strain: the outbreak of the **Syrian Civil War in 2011** put Hamas in a tough spot between its Sunni identity and its Iranian patron. Hamas\u2019s political bureau (then in Damascus) refused to back Assad\u2019s brutal crackdown on mostly Sunni rebels, and in 2012 Hamas leaders left Syria, implicitly siding with the Syrian opposition. Iran, which was all-in for Assad, responded by temporarily cutting funding to Hamas (and instead boosting support to PIJ). For a few years, Hamas\u2019s ties with Iran cooled. Nonetheless, by 2014\u20132015, Hamas-Iran relations warmed again due to their **shared hostility toward Israel** and perhaps mutual need (Hamas needed funds; Iran sought to unite its axis amid regional polarization). \n\nSince then, Iran has consistently been acknowledged as **Hamas\u2019s chief military sponsor**. According to U.S. and Israeli officials, Iran provides an estimated **$100 million per year** split among Hamas and PIJ\u301031\u2020L131-L139\u3011. Iran has supplied **weapons technology** \u2013 for example, Iranian engineers taught Hamas to build improved rockets and drones domestically (using smuggled components and local workshops). Israeli military intelligence believes many of Hamas\u2019s rockets are basically **Iranian designs** (the Qassam rockets evolved with Iranian input; the longer-range M-75 and Sejjil rockets are derived from Iran\u2019s Fajr and M302 rockets). In addition, **Hamas fighters have routinely trained in Iran and with Hezbollah in Lebanon**. Dozens (if not hundreds) of Hamas operatives traveled to Iran or Syria for training in fields like rockets, drones, tunneling, and commando tactics\u301031\u2020L139-L146\u3011. A **Western intelligence official** disclosed that Hamas operatives trained in IRGC-run camps outside Gaza and then returned to impart skills to others\u301031\u2020L69-L77\u3011\u301031\u2020L139-L147\u3011. For instance, the use of paragliders by Hamas in the October 2023 assault was cited as a capability that **\u201csurely required training outside of Gaza\u201d** \u2013 likely in places like Iran or Lebanon\u301031\u2020L103-L111\u3011.\n\nIranian leaders have not hidden this relationship. **Iran\u2019s supreme leader and IRGC commanders frequently praise Hamas**. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi spoke with Hamas\u2019s Haniyeh in 2023, calling the militant offensive a proud achievement. After the Oct 2023 Hamas attack, the White House\u2019s Deputy NSC Advisor stated: \u201cIran is broadly complicit\u2026 They have provided them [Hamas] weapons, training, and financial support for decades\u201d\u301031\u2020L113-L121\u3011. While U.S. intelligence did not confirm Iran **directly ordered** the Oct 7, 2023 attack, it acknowledged Iran\u2019s long-term material contribution made such an attack possible\u301031\u2020L41-L49\u3011\u301031\u2020L51-L58\u3011.\n\n**Types of Iranian support:**  \n- *Financial:* Iran funnels money to Hamas, often routed through Hezbollah or other intermediaries to avoid sanctions. Iranian officials have publicly mentioned supporting the \u201cPalestinian resistance\u201d to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Hamas leader Haniyeh in 2022 thanked Iran for $70 million in military aid that year\u301031\u2020L131-L139\u3011.  \n- *Weapons and Tech:* Iran sends arms or blueprints. Many rockets in Gaza are built from Iranian designs. Iran provided Hamas with **components for guided munitions** and assisted in developing drones and anti-tank missiles. For example, Hamas\u2019s anti-tank Kornet missiles are believed to be supplied by Iran (or via Libya with Iran\u2019s coordination). Iran\u2019s smuggling network through Sudan/Sinai was largely disrupted by 2014 (with multiple Israeli airstrikes on convoys), so Iran shifted to teaching Hamas to build weapons indigenously using common materials (fertilizer for explosives, fiberglass pipe for rocket bodies, etc.). Still, Iranian-made weapons occasionally show up; in 2021, Hamas deployed an unmanned submersible drone, likely with Iranian input.  \n- *Training:* The IRGC\u2019s Quds Force and **Hezbollah (Iran\u2019s Lebanese proxy)** have trained Hamas cadres. Some training occurred in **Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley** under Hezbollah supervision\u301031\u2020L139-L146\u3011, some in **IRGC camps in Iran** (possibly in Khuzestan desert or near Qom). Training areas cover tactics like urban warfare, sniper techniques, and use of advanced weapons (like UAVs). The close relationship between Hamas\u2019 armed wing and Hezbollah is evidenced by Hezbollah\u2019s openly coordination with Hamas during conflicts, and shared tactics (e.g., both dug extensive tunnel networks, likely exchanging expertise).  \n- *Ideological and diplomatic support:* Iran portrays Hamas as part of the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d against Israel. It provides Hamas leaders with diplomatic cover and media platforms (Iran\u2019s state media gives Hamas ample positive coverage). \n\nWhile Iran is a predominantly Shia state, it frames the Palestinian issue in pan-Islamic terms, thus justifying backing a Sunni group. Hamas, for its part, downplays sectarian differences when it comes to Iran. A senior Hamas official once stated: *\u201cIran\u2019s support is unconditional and purely out of Islamic solidarity.\u201d* Though that may gloss over Iran\u2019s strategic interests, it reflects Hamas\u2019s acceptance of aid regardless of sect. \n\n**State-Level Sponsorship and Reactions:** Israel has long accused Iran of **\u201coutsourcing\u201d terrorism to proxies like Hamas**. The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned numerous individuals and companies in Iran, Lebanon, and elsewhere for financing Hamas (e.g., an IRGC-QF operative, **Fawzi Shahada**, was sanctioned for coordinating Iranian money transfers to Hamas and PIJ). Sunni Arab governments, historically distrustful of Iran, also acknowledge Iran\u2019s role. For example, Saudi Arabia and Egypt often criticized Hamas\u2019s ties to Iran (particularly when it destabilized Gaza or linked to conflicts like Yemen). After the 2023 Hamas-Israel war, Western officials openly credited Iranian support for dramatically improving Hamas\u2019s military capabilities (such as more precise rockets and military-grade drones seen in 2023)\u301031\u2020L77-L86\u3011\u301031\u2020L139-L147\u3011. \n\nAt the same time, **Iran officially denies direct control** of Hamas operations. After the Oct 7, 2023 attack, Iran\u2019s UN mission claimed: *\u201cWe are not involved in Palestine\u2019s response, as it is taken solely by Palestine itself\u201d*\u301031\u2020L119-L127\u3011. Iranian leaders insist Hamas makes its own decisions, even as they cheer the results. This plausible deniability is typical \u2013 Iran provides the means, but Hamas chooses the timing and tactics. Israeli and U.S. intelligence in 2023 said they had *no evidence of Iran issuing the specific order* for the Oct 7 attack\u301031\u2020L61-L69\u3011. Nonetheless, IRGC officials had reportedly helped Hamas with planning and training for complex operations over the preceding year\u301031\u2020L41-L49\u3011. The consensus in investigative journalism (e.g. **Washington Post** reporting) is that **Iran was deeply involved in Hamas\u2019s force buildup**, making it *\u201cbroadly complicit\u201d* in Hamas\u2019s ability to wage war\u301031\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301031\u2020L41-L49\u3011.\n\n**Hezbollah as a Conduit:** Iran often uses Hezbollah to interface with Hamas. Hezbollah acts as a mentor and quartermaster for Palestinian militants under Iran\u2019s guidance. For example, when relations were strained due to Syria, Hezbollah continued some level of cooperation with Hamas. Many Hamas operatives evacuated from Damascus in 2012 found refuge in Hezbollah\u2019s Beirut stronghold (Dahiya), at least temporarily. Hezbollah helped broker restored Iran-Hamas ties by 2017. And during conflicts, Hezbollah and Iran coordinate regionally (e.g., Hezbollah\u2019s limited clashes with Israel often coincide with Gaza flare-ups, as seen in 2021 and 2023). **Iran\u2019s IRGC-Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani** was a key figure managing these proxy relationships until his 2020 assassination \u2013 he was revered by Hamas; Ismail Haniyeh even attended Soleimani\u2019s funeral in Tehran and hailed him as \u201cthe martyr of Jerusalem.\u201d \n\nIn summary, **Hamas\u2019s link to Iran is substantial and direct**: **financial sponsorship, arms supplies, and military training** are the pillars of the partnership\u301031\u2020L113-L121\u3011\u301031\u2020L131-L139\u3011. This is a classic case of **state-level sponsorship of a non-state actor**. Iran\u2019s motivation is to pressure Israel and gain leverage in the region by supporting Palestinian armed struggle, while Hamas benefits from the resources of a regional power to augment its guerrilla and terrorist capabilities. Other governments (from the U.S. and EU to Arab states) have officially designated Hamas as a terrorist organization and frequently single out Iran for enabling Hamas. Israeli officials often say Iran \u201chas the blood of our citizens on its hands\u201d via Hamas and PIJ rockets. On the other side, Hamas leaders credit Iran for their military successes \u2013 a Hamas official in 2021 stated openly: *\u201cAll the weapons we use to fight Israel, we got thanks to Iran\u201d*. \n\nThere is an ironic footnote: Hamas remains ideologically Sunni and has at times repressed Gaza\u2019s tiny Shia community (some Gazans who converted to Shiism under Iranian influence have faced persecution by Hamas). But these sectarian issues are minor compared to the strategic alignment against Israel. As a **result, Iran, Hamas, PIJ, and Hezbollah** now form a coordinated axis. Iranian media calls Hamas \u201cthe Palestinian branch of the Islamic Revolution.\u201d And Hamas\u2019s recent operations have borne hallmarks of Iranian tactical input (e.g., use of drones to disable Israeli border sensors in 2023, which is an IRGC-style innovation). \n\nTo conclude, **Iran\u2019s relationship with Hamas is one of patron and client, forged for the purpose of confronting Israel**. It stands as a prominent example of Iran extending its revolutionary influence beyond the Shia sphere to a Sunni militant group \u2013 underscoring that Iran\u2019s support for \u201cterrorist organizations with Middle Eastern roots\u201d extends across sectarian lines when convenient. Iranian officials half-jokingly refer to Hamas (and PIJ) as \u201cSunni Hezbollah,\u201d emphasizing that for Tehran, the **cause of \u201cresistance\u201d transcends sect** when it comes to fighting Israel. The longevity and increasing depth of Iran-Hamas ties, despite ups and downs, demonstrate the strategic value both sides derive from this partnership.\n\n*(Sources: Washington Post investigative report\u301031\u2020L41-L49\u3011\u301031\u2020L51-L58\u3011; statements by U.S. NSC officials\u301031\u2020L113-L121\u3011; State Dept 2020 report\u301031\u2020L131-L139\u3011; Council on Foreign Relations; Reuters and BBC monitoring of Iran-Hamas relations.)*\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** In the decades since the Cold War, the Greater Middle East has seen the rise of numerous militant organizations \u2013 each with its own local origins and goals, yet many entangled in the region\u2019s broader geopolitical rivalries. A recurring theme in the above profiles is the role of the Islamic Republic of **Iran** as an influencer \u2013 sometimes adversary, sometimes patron \u2013 of these groups:\n\n- Iran directly **created and controls Hezbollah**, a Shia militia that is effectively an arm of Iranian policy\u301021\u2020L328-L336\u3011\u301021\u2020L331-L338\u3011. \n- Iran cultivated ties with **Sunni groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad**, providing them significant support against Israel\u301031\u2020L131-L139\u3011\u301031\u2020L139-L146\u3011. \n- Iran has a convoluted love-hate history with **al-Qaeda** \u2013 fighting its offshoots in some theaters while clandestinely harboring or assisting elements of it to hurt U.S. interests\u301011\u2020L158-L162\u3011\u301015\u2020L49-L57\u3011.\n- Iran fiercely opposed **ISIS** and contributed to its defeat, underscoring sectarian divides (Shia Iran vs. ISIS\u2019s anti-Shia jihad) rather than any collusion.\n- Iran\u2019s relationship with **the Taliban** flipped from near-war in 1998 to tactical cooperation against the U.S., to a wary neighborly relationship today\u301050\u2020L59-L67\u3011\u301042\u2020L142-L150\u3011.\n- Meanwhile, purely local Sunni extremist movements like **Boko Haram** have remained outside Iran\u2019s sphere, aligning instead with Iran\u2019s Sunni jihadist rivals (al-Qaeda/ISIS), and thus received no Iranian patronage \u2013 indeed Boko Haram stands ideologically antithetical to Iran\u2019s revolutionary Shiism.\n\n**State-level sponsorship** has been a key factor in the endurance and potency of many of these groups. Iran features prominently as *the* state sponsor for Hezbollah, Hamas, PIJ, and certain Iraqi and Yemeni militias, leveraging them as proxies to project power. Other states have also been accused of sponsorship: for example, some Gulf Arab states\u2019 citizens funneled funds to al-Qaeda, and Pakistan\u2019s security services long supported the Taliban. But Iran\u2019s role, given its revolutionary ideology and its IRGC\u2019s mandate, is unique in scope and consistency. The **Iranian government officially denies supporting \u201cterrorist\u201d groups**, framing its assistance as support for \u201cliberation movements\u201d or denying involvement altogether (as seen in its denials regarding al-Qaeda presence and Hamas operations)\u301031\u2020L119-L127\u3011\u301015\u2020L11-L19\u3011. However, evidence from **intelligence agencies, the United Nations, trials, and even admissions by group leaders** paints a detailed picture of Iran\u2019s extensive network of partnerships.\n\nIn evaluating each group\u2019s ties to Iran, it\u2019s clear that **ideology is not always a barrier** to cooperation \u2013 pragmatic common cause can trump sectarian divides. Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ali Khamenei once dubbed the U.S., Israel, and Sunni jihadists like ISIS as \u201cTakfiri enemies,\u201d while praising Sunni Hamas as \u201cheroic resistance.\u201d This illustrates Iran\u2019s selective approach. On the receiving end, groups like Hamas and the Taliban have shown that hardline Sunnis can accept aid from a Shia power if it serves their objectives.\n\nFinally, these linkages have had significant geopolitical implications. They have fueled proxy wars (e.g., Iran vs Saudi via support of different factions in Yemen, Syria, etc.), complicated counterterrorism efforts (Iran\u2019s harboring of al-Qaeda figures created an intelligence blind spot and a diplomatic dilemma), and entrenched conflicts (Iran\u2019s support helps sustain Hezbollah\u2019s conflict with Israel indefinitely, and empowers Hamas in ways that periodically lead to war). They have also led to Iran\u2019s increased isolation: Iran remains designated by the U.S. as the world\u2019s **\u201cleading state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d** largely due to the very connections discussed above. Understanding these origins and linkages \u2013 through primary sources, government findings, academic analyses, and investigative journalism \u2013 is essential for any comprehensive security assessment of the Middle East\u2019s post-Cold War landscape.\n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":332,"end_ix":346,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Timeline: the Rise, Spread, and Fall of the Islamic State | Wilson Center","url":"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/timeline-the-rise-spread-and-fall-the-islamic-state#:~:text=The%20Islamic%20State%20%E2%80%93%20also,attacks%20and%20bolster%20its%20ranks","text":"The Islamic State \u2013 also known as ISIS, ISIL, or Daesh \u2013 emerged from the remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), a local offshoot of al Qaeda founded by Abu Musab al Zarqawi in 2004.
