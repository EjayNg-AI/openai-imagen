We focus on four Singapore towns \u2013 **Bishan, Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, and Serangoon** \u2013 looking at **ground-floor HDB shophouses** and **units in shopping complexes** suitable for such use. Current rental listings and official data are analyzed to understand typical **rental rates per square meter**, overall monthly rents, unit sizes, and how **location factors (foot traffic, proximity to MRT/amenities)** influence pricing. Tables are provided for each area to compare sample listings (with rents converted to S$/m\u00b2 for consistency). All figures are monthly rents, and foot traffic notes are included where available.  \n\n## Bishan (D20) \u2013 HDB Shophouses & Junction 8 Vicinity  \nBishan offers both neighborhood HDB shop units and mall spaces (Junction 8 being the major complex). **HDB shophouses** in residential clusters (e.g. along Bishan St\u00a022 or St\u00a013) are typically small ground-floor units. Rents here vary with foot traffic \u2013 for instance, a tiny 21\u00a0m\u00b2 shop near the Bishan St\u00a022 market is asking **~S$187/m\u00b2** (\u2248S$17.4\u00a0psf)\u301026\u2020L29-L32\u3011, reflecting the steady stream of nearby shoppers. In contrast, a larger 84\u00a0m\u00b2 void-deck unit in a quieter precinct was listed at around **S$69/m\u00b2** (\u2248S$6.42\u00a0psf)\u301026\u2020L11-L15\u3011. Units close to **Bishan MRT/Junction\u00a08** are mostly within the mall or bus interchange; while specific mall listings are scarce (as these are usually leased via mall management), mall retail rents in prime suburban locations can exceed S$200/m\u00b2 (\u2248S$18\u2013$20\u00a0psf) based on market averages. The table below shows sample Bishan listings:\n\n| **Location / Description**                     | **Size** | **Asking Rent**     | **Rent per m\u00b2**       | **Notes (Foot Traffic)**                |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------:|--------------------:|----------------------:|-----------------------------------------|\n| Bishan St\u202f22 HDB shop (near market & schools) | ~21\u00a0m\u00b2   | S$4,000/mo\u301026\u2020L29-L32\u3011 | ~S$187/m\u00b2            | Small but strategic location (high footfall from market)\u301026\u2020L29-L32\u3011. |\n| Bishan St\u202f11 \u201cBishan Green\u201d shop (neighborhood area) | ~84\u00a0m\u00b2   | S$5,800/mo\u301026\u2020L11-L15\u3011 | ~S$69/m\u00b2             | Larger void-deck unit in residential zone (moderate local traffic)\u301026\u2020L11-L15\u3011. |\n\n*Trend:* **Bishan**\u2019s rental rates range widely depending on location. Heartland shops deep inside the estate see lower rents (~S$60\u2013$70/m\u00b2), while **high-traffic spots** (near markets or transport hubs) command higher rates (~S$180\u2013$200/m\u00b2). Proximity to Bishan MRT/Junction\u00a08 boosts value, though such spaces are limited (mostly within the mall). Unit sizes for rent are generally small (20\u201380\u00a0m\u00b2), which suits tuition setups needing 1\u20133 small classrooms.\n\n## Toa Payoh (D12) \u2013 Busy Central Hub vs Neighborhood Shops  \n**Toa Payoh** is a mature estate with a very busy town center and also smaller neighborhood clusters. The **Toa Payoh Central** area (around Lorong\u00a06 and the HDB Hub/MRT) sees some of the *highest heartland rents*. A ground-floor shophouse ~65\u00a0m\u00b2 in the prime central walkway was asking **S$27,500/month** (about **S$423/m\u00b2**, or $39.3\u00a0psf)\u301025\u2020L23-L30\u3011 \u2013 a reflection of the heavy foot traffic from the MRT, bus interchange, and amenities. Not all central units are that steep; another 65\u00a0m\u00b2 unit slightly off the main flow was listed at **S$11,200/month** (~**S$172/m\u00b2**, or $16\u00a0psf)\u301025\u2020L9-L15\u3011. Outside the hub, rents drop significantly. For example, a small void-deck shop (~11\u00a0m\u00b2) in Lorong\u00a01 was advertised at just **S$1,100** monthly (\u2248**S$100/m\u00b2**, or $9.17\u00a0psf)\u301024\u2020L1-L4\u3011. This wide range highlights how **location and foot traffic** in Toa Payoh dramatically affect rents:\n\n| **Location / Description**                    | **Size** | **Asking Rent**      | **Rent per m\u00b2**      | **Notes (Foot Traffic)**                       |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------:|---------------------:|---------------------:|------------------------------------------------|\n| Toa Payoh Central shophouse (prime, near MRT) | ~65\u00a0m\u00b2   | S$27,500/mo\u301025\u2020L23-L30\u3011 | ~S$423/m\u00b2           | Ground-floor unit in central hub (extremely high footfall).\u301025\u2020L23-L30\u3011 |\n| Toa Payoh Central unit (off main walkway)    | ~65\u00a0m\u00b2   | S$11,200/mo\u301025\u2020L9-L15\u3011  | ~S$172/m\u00b2           | Still central, but less prime frontage (steady traffic).\u301025\u2020L9-L15\u3011 |\n| Lorong\u00a01 neighborhood shop (void deck)       | ~11\u00a0m\u00b2   | S$1,100/mo\u301024\u2020L1-L4\u3011   | ~S$100/m\u00b2           | Small local shop in residential block (low foot traffic).\u301024\u2020L1-L4\u3011 |\n\n*Trend:* **Toa Payoh** shows a stark **central-vs-neighborhood split**. The bustling town centre commands **premium rents** \u2013 often S$300\u2013$450/m\u00b2 for ground floor units, given the constant stream of commuters and shoppers. In contrast, shops in the *housing estate blocks* (farther from the MRT) are far more affordable (under S$100\u2013$150/m\u00b2). For a tuition centre, this means balancing visibility and cost: a central unit guarantees footfall but at a very high price, whereas an HDB block shop deeper in the estate is budget-friendly but will rely on local residents/students. Unit sizes vary, but many Toa Payoh listings are around 50\u201370\u00a0m\u00b2 in central areas (suitable for partitioning into a couple of classrooms), while some very small units (<20\u00a0m\u00b2) pop up in older blocks. \n\n## Ang Mo Kio (D20) \u2013 Heartland Town Centre and Sector Hubs  \n**Ang Mo Kio** is a large heartland town with a major central hub (AMK Hub mall, MRT/bus interchange) and many sub-centers (markets and neighborhood complexes in its various precincts). **HDB shophouse rentals in Ang Mo Kio** are generally moderate in cost, with many falling in the **S$110\u2013$130 per m\u00b2** range (~S$10\u2013$12 psf). For example, a typical 70\u00a0m\u00b2 neighborhood shop unit was listed at **S$8,000/month** (\u2248S$120/m\u00b2)\u301017\u2020L4-L8\u3011. Such units often highlight strong residential footfall; one 69\u00a0m\u00b2 listing even advertises *\u201cHigh Footfall\u201d* at that location\u301020\u2020L0-L2\u3011. Closer to the town center, prices climb. An HDB shophouse at the central **Ang Mo Kio Ave\u00a08/ Ave\u00a03 area** (near the hub) can reach around **S$25,000 for ~100\u00a0m\u00b2** \u2013 about **S$250/m\u00b2** (\u2248$23\u00a0psf)\u30103\u2020L37-L40\u3011. In addition to HDB shops, Ang Mo Kio has some small **shopping complexes** like Jubilee Square; rents there are comparable to the higher-end HDB rates (e.g. ~93\u00a0m\u00b2 for **S$16k** \u2192 ~**S$171/m\u00b2** at Jubilee)\u301021\u2020L1-L4\u3011. The table below compares a few examples:\n\n| **Location / Description**                          | **Size** | **Asking Rent**      | **Rent per m\u00b2**      | **Notes (Foot Traffic)**                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------:|---------------------:|---------------------:|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Ang Mo Kio neighborhood shop (heartland area)      | ~70\u00a0m\u00b2   | S$8,000/mo\u301017\u2020L4-L8\u3011   | ~S$120/m\u00b2           | Ground floor HDB shop in residential cluster (good local footfall)\u301020\u2020L0-L2\u3011. |\n| Ang Mo Kio Central shophouse (near AMK Hub)        | ~100\u00a0m\u00b2  | S$25,000/mo\u30103\u2020L37-L40\u3011 | ~S$250/m\u00b2           | Large HDB shophouse by town center/MRT (heavy traffic from mall & interchange)\u30103\u2020L37-L40\u3011. |\n| Jubilee Square mall unit (private complex)         | ~93\u00a0m\u00b2   | S$16,000/mo\u301021\u2020L1-L4\u3011  | ~S$171/m\u00b2           | Retail unit in shopping mall (central AMK), managed commercial complex (steady crowd)\u301021\u2020L1-L4\u3011. |\n\n*Trend:* **Ang Mo Kio** rentals are generally in the mid-range for suburban areas. Typical HDB shop rents cluster around **S$100\u2013$150/m\u00b2**, which aligns with many heartland tuition/enrichment centers\u2019 budgets. Prime locations (central hub or popular wet market areas) see higher rents pushing **S$200\u2013$250/m\u00b2**, though such prices are still a bit lower than Toa Payoh\u2019s central hub. The presence of malls like AMK Hub and Jubilee means some educational centers also opt for mall space for visibility. However, mall rents (e.g. Jubilee at ~$170/m\u00b2) are similar to renting a prime HDB shophouse. **Foot traffic** is a key differentiator in AMK: units near **transport nodes or hawker centres** boast \u201cgood human traffic\u201d and higher PSFs\u30101\u2020L35-L38\u3011, whereas those deeper in housing estates (e.g. inside precincts like Ang Mo Kio Ave\u00a05/Ave\u00a010) are cheaper but rely on local footfall. Unit sizes in listings vary from ~50\u00a0m\u00b2 small shops to >100\u00a0m\u00b2 dual-unit shophouses, so a small tuition center can find appropriately sized options.\n\n## Serangoon (D19) \u2013 Central Mall and Local Shops  \n**Serangoon** town\u2019s commercial scene is dominated by NEX, one of the largest suburban malls, at the Serangoon MRT interchange. Surrounding the mall are some HDB shop clusters (e.g. along Serangoon Central and Lorong Lew Lian), and farther out are neighborhood shops in areas like Serangoon North. Ground-floor HDB **shops near NEX/Serangoon MRT** naturally command high rents due to immense footfall. For example, a ~60\u00a0m\u00b2 HDB shop opposite NEX was marketed at **S$12,500/month**, about **S$215/m\u00b2** (\u2248$20\u00a0psf)\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011. Just a short walk away, rates temper slightly: an HDB shophouse ~33\u00a0m\u00b2 along Lorong Lew Lian (behind NEX, near an MRT exit) asks **S$4,500** (\u2248**S$136/m\u00b2**, or $12.7\u00a0psf)\u301033\u2020L6-L10\u3011 \u2013 lower in absolute terms due to its smaller size and more local catchment, but still reflecting decent foot traffic. In Serangoon North (not in the MRT vicinity), rents would be on the lower end (likely similar to other heartland areas, e.g. S$80\u2013$120/m\u00b2), though specific current listings were sparse. Below are Serangoon sample rentals:\n\n| **Location / Description**                       | **Size** | **Asking Rent**      | **Rent per m\u00b2**      | **Notes (Foot Traffic)**                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------:|---------------------:|---------------------:|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Serangoon Central HDB shop (opposite NEX mall)  | ~60\u00a0m\u00b2   | S$12,500/mo\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011 | ~S$215/m\u00b2           | Prime location next to NEX & MRT (very high footfall from commuters).\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011 |\n| Lorong Lew Lian HDB shophouse (Serangoon Central area) | ~33\u00a0m\u00b2   | S$4,500/mo\u301033\u2020L6-L10\u3011  | ~S$136/m\u00b2           | Small shop behind NEX, near MRT exit (good local traffic, but not main flow).\u301033\u2020L6-L10\u3011 |\n\n*Trend:* **Serangoon** exhibits a **steep gradient**: the immediate MRT/mall vicinity is priced similarly to other top-tier suburban hubs (~S$200+m\u00b2), while just a block or two away, rents drop to more typical heartland levels (~S$120\u2013$150/m\u00b2). There are fewer HDB shop units in Serangoon compared to Ang\u00a0Mo\u00a0Kio or Toa\u00a0Payoh, as NEX occupies much of the commercial space. Many tuition and enrichment centres in Serangoon operate either inside NEX (taking advantage of the crowd, albeit at higher mall rents) or in nearby HDB shops for lower cost. Serangoon North (a distance from the MRT) would offer the cheapest rents in the Serangoon area, but those locations may have limited walk-in traffic (mostly serving nearby residents). For a small tuition center, a **trade-off between rent and visibility** is evident \u2013 central Serangoon options cost more but tap into a large pool of students passing through the interchange.\n\n## Comparison and Key Takeaways  \n\n- **Rental Rate Ranges:** Across these towns, **Toa Payoh Central** stands out with the highest rents (up to ~S$420/m\u00b2 for prime units)\u301025\u2020L23-L30\u3011, owing to its established hub status. **Serangoon Central** (NEX area) and **Ang Mo Kio Central** have slightly lower peak rents (around S$200\u2013$250/m\u00b2)\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011\u30103\u2020L37-L40\u3011. **Bishan**\u2019s heartland shops are generally more affordable unless very near Junction\u00a08 or a market (~S$180/m\u00b2 max in our samples)\u301026\u2020L29-L32\u3011. Typical neighborhood HDB shop rentals in all four towns often fall in the **S$100\u2013$150 per m\u00b2** range (\u2248S$9\u2013$14 psf), which aligns with the **average suburban retail rent** of about S$158/m\u00b2 (S$14.70 psf) reported in Q3 2024\u30109\u2020L1-L7\u3011. This suggests that **heartland tuition centers can expect around S$1,500\u2013$5,000 monthly rent** for small units on the lower end, up to five-figure sums for prime, centrally-located units.\n\n- **Unit Sizes:** The available units suitable for small classes typically range from **20\u00a0m\u00b2 to 100\u00a0m\u00b2**. Very small units (<20\u00a0m\u00b2) do exist (often former sundry shops or kiosks) but may only fit one small classroom at best. More practical spaces for 2\u20133 concurrent classes are in the 50\u201380\u00a0m\u00b2 range (e.g. many listings around 60\u201370\u00a0m\u00b2 in these towns). For instance, a ~70\u00a0m\u00b2 unit can be partitioned into two or three classrooms for groups of 5, plus a waiting area. Larger shophouses (~100\u00a0m\u00b2) could accommodate more comfortably but come with higher absolute rent. \n\n- **Foot Traffic & Location:** **Foot traffic is the key price driver** in these rentals. Ground-floor units adjacent to **MRT stations, bus interchanges, popular malls, markets, or hawker centres** demand a substantial premium. Landlords often highlight these advantages in listings, noting features like *\u201chigh footfall\u201d*\u301020\u2020L0-L2\u3011 or *\u201cnear MRT/Good human traffic\u201d*\u30101\u2020L35-L38\u3011. Such locations can justify double or triple the rent per m\u00b2 compared to quieter estate interiors. For a tuition centre, high foot traffic can help in visibility and walk-in inquiries, but many centers also thrive in secondary locations by building reputation and networks \u2013 hence paying top dollar for a prime spot might not be necessary if budget is a concern.\n\n- **HDB vs Private Commercial:** Renting an **HDB shophouse** is often more cost-effective than comparable space in a privately owned mall or commercial building. Government data shows HDB shop rents tend to be \u201cfar below private rentals\u201d \u2013 the median rent for private retail space *outside the central area* was >**S$140/m\u00b2** (~$13 psf) in 2021\u301029\u2020L1-L4\u3011, whereas many HDB shops in heartlands were below that. In our findings, several HDB listings in these towns are around or under that median. **Private malls** (even heartland ones like Junction\u00a08 or NEX) often charge higher rents, but smaller suburban malls (e.g. Jubilee Square, Thomson Plaza) showed rents in line with HDB shops (~S$170\u2013$195/m\u00b2)\u301021\u2020L1-L4\u3011\u30102\u2020L47-L50\u3011. Prospective tenants should weigh factors like central air-con, mall operating hours, and common area charges in malls versus the independence of an HDB unit.\n\n- **Location-Based Trends:** Among the four locales, **Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio** are older estates with large populations and have a wide spread of rent options \u2013 from very low in outlying areas to very high in the hub. **Bishan** has fewer commercial pockets (mostly concentrated near Junction\u00a08 and a couple of neighborhood centers), generally keeping rents moderate to high due to limited supply. **Serangoon**\u2019s prime rents concentrate at NEX (a newer hub drawing crowds even from outside the town), but outside of that, the town has relatively fewer commercial units, making those near NEX quite sought after. Each area shows that being within ~100\u2013200\u00a0m of an MRT station or popular center can exponentially increase rental rates. \n\nIn summary, **rental rates (per m\u00b2)** for small tuition-suitable spaces in these heartland towns typically fall into a **two-tier spectrum**: roughly **S$100\u2013$180/m\u00b2 for neighborhood locations** versus **S$180\u2013$450/m\u00b2 in busy central spots**. Overall monthly rents range from as low as ~$1k for tiny peripheral units to $20k\u2013$30k for prime units in central hubs. Aspiring tuition center operators should carefully consider how much foot traffic and visibility they truly need for their business model, and balance that against rental costs. Fortunately, each of these towns offers a variety of unit sizes and price points, from affordable HDB shophouses in the housing blocks to pricier units right in the middle of the action, allowing for strategic choice based on budget and target student catchment. The data and examples above, sourced from current listings and official statistics, provide a benchmark for negotiating and selecting the most suitable space. \n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":1301,"end_ix":1313,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Bishan Street 22 (D20), Shop House - For Rent #103413871 - SRX","url":"https://www.srx.com.sg/listings/103413871/for-rent-bishan-street-22-284-bishan-retail-shop-for-rent-near-market#:~:text=Bishan%20Street%2022%20,Catholic","text":"Bishan Street 22 (D20), Shop House - For Rent ; Asking. $4,000 ; Size. 230 sqft (Built-up) ; PSF. $17.39 psf (Built-up) ; Primary Schools.
