between Israel's Muslim community and the broader Israeli society are multifaceted, encompassing aspects of identity, civil rights, intercommunal interactions, and collaborative initiatives.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Identity and Integration**\n\n\ue203Israel's Muslim citizens, primarily Sunni Arabs, navigate a complex identity landscape.\ue204 \ue203Surveys indicate that many identify as \"Arab citizens of Israel,\" reflecting a dual sense of national and civic identity.\ue204 \ue203For instance, a 2017 poll found that 40.8% of Arab Israelis identified as \"Arab citizens of Israel,\" while 15.4% identified as \"Palestinian.\"\ue204 \ue203This duality underscores the community's efforts to balance cultural heritage with citizenship in a predominantly Jewish state.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue201\ue206\n\n**Civil Rights and Discrimination**\n\n\ue203Despite formal equality under Israeli law, Muslim citizens often face systemic challenges.\ue204 \ue203Reports highlight disparities in areas such as education, employment, and housing.\ue204 \ue203A 2015 survey revealed that 79% of Arab citizens perceived significant discrimination against Muslims in Israel, with 38% reporting personal experiences of discrimination within the past year.\ue204 \ue203These experiences include being questioned by security officials, travel restrictions, and property damage.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue201\ue206\n\n**Intercommunal Relations**\n\n\ue203Interactions between Muslim and Jewish communities in Israel are complex.\ue204 \ue203While there are instances of cooperation and coexistence, tensions persist.\ue204 \ue203A 2016 Pew Research poll indicated that nearly half of Israeli Jews supported the idea of transferring or expelling Arab citizens from Israel.\ue204 \ue203Conversely, a 2010 survey found that 71% of Arab citizens blamed Jews for hardships experienced by Palestinians during and after the 1948 \"Nakba.\"\ue204 \ue203These sentiments reflect deep-seated historical grievances and ongoing societal divisions.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue201\ue206\n\n**Collaborative Initiatives**\n\n\ue203Efforts to bridge divides include various interfaith and intercultural projects.\ue204 \ue203The Interreligious Coordinating Council in Israel (ICCI), founded in 1991, aims to promote understanding among different faith communities.\ue204 \ue203ICCI organizes dialogue groups, educational programs, and community actions to foster reconciliation and coexistence.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203Additionally, initiatives like Neve Shalom-Wahat Al-Salam (\"Oasis of Peace\") exemplify grassroots efforts toward coexistence.\ue204 \ue203This village, established in 1970, is home to both Jewish and Arab citizens who live and work together, operating bilingual schools and community programs that serve as models for peaceful cohabitation.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue201\ue206\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n\ue203Recent events have further impacted these relations.\ue204 \ue203For instance, in March 2025, Israel imposed age-based restrictions on Muslim worshippers from the West Bank visiting the Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan, allowing only men over 55 and women over 50, along with children up to age 12, to enter.\ue204 \ue203This move has been viewed by some as exacerbating tensions between the Muslim community and Israeli authorities.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203In summary, while there are ongoing efforts to promote integration and mutual understanding, the relationship between Israel's Muslim community and the broader society remains complex, influenced by historical contexts, systemic challenges, and contemporary developments.\ue204\ue206
