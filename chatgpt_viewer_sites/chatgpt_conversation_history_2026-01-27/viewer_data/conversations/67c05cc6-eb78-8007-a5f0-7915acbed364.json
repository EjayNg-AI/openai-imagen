Please help me unpack it critically. DAVID SHAPIRO: I've been mulling this for a while: regarding DEI and woke narratives.  \n\r\nThe first time I really had an \"ick\" moment around wokeness was more than a decade ago when a friend of a friend started virtue signaling about being woke - that they were somehow morally superior for being woke. \r\n\r\nThe second time was learning about \"decolonization\" which is a narrative that basically wants to erase the \"whiteness\" from history - I know it's more \"nuanced\" than that, but it basically is a type of historical revisionism justified by \"racism.\" (yes, we all know the British Empire was problematic)\r\n\r\nThe turning point for me, enough was enough, when someone was flying off the handle about how I was a white male shitlord (back in the days of Facebook) just because I'm white. I'm like \"I'm Jewish, do not lecture me about genocide\" and the response was \"oh, okay, I GUESS that counts too\" - gatekeeping intergenerational trauma is cringe. The irony of that level of racism \"all white people bad\" is idiotic. \r\n\r\nThe last straw was the therapist my ex wife and I went to. She was \"feminist\" insofar as as \"men are always wrong\" - if I was angry, it was all my fault for being angry. If I was stoic, it was all my fault for being disengaged. My ex, on the other hand, had a free pass to escalate every conflict and become hysterical because she felt abandoned. Our therapist actually encouraged, defended, and validated my ex's abusive behavior.\r\n\r\nHere's the thing, DEI and wokeness is what I call a \"negative referent\" in terms of epistemic tribal theory. In other words, the gravitational center of DEI and wokeness is grievances. The formula is simple \"X has harmed me, therefore X is bad.\" There's no positive referents in this movement. It is simply a destructive framework. Privilege is bad, intelligence is bad, whiteness is bad, men are bad, technology is bad, inequality is bad. Everything is bad. It's the social equivalent of nihilism. \r\n\r\nInstead, the current tone has shifted: \"meritocracy is good, excellence is good, innovation is good, progress is good, technology is good.\" \r\n\r\nI say this now because the lens by which you look through world really dramatically shapes how you interpret, well, everything. I'm also the same person who has a huge amount of neurodiverse and LGBT people in my community. Kindness is also good. Safety and security are also good. \r\n\r\nParticularly as AI search tools have saturated the market, and it's easier to make sense of complex issues, cut through the noise, and figure out what's factually going on, the world just does not seem as grimdark as people want you to think it is. It's not just mainstream media, it's all the talking heads on every social media platform. Outrage, disgust, and grievances sell, simple as that. \r\n\r\nThis is why I left the AI safety movement, it was another rhetorical house of cards built on vibes and preying on people's anxiety. No data, no evidence, no foundational theory. Just some flimsy postulates proposed by internet forumites and philosophers. Only in an era where the social milieu accepts, tolerates, and rewards vibes-based narratives (i.e. woke and DEI) would something like AI doomerism really take hold. No evidence, just \"everything is bad, therefore it's okay and cool to interpret everything as bad\"\r\n\r\nYes, all new things need scrutiny, sure. All old things also need scrutiny. But it's one thing to evaluate everything with a critical lens. It's quite another to go in with the preconceived notion \"new thing automatically bad and problematic, now let me just justify this with some vibes and narrative construction\"\r\n\r\nWhen I examined all the data, evidence, and science of AI safety, I found the arguments wanting. When I started pivoting to \"acceleration is clearly the most rational, and likely strategy\" I had some (now former) AI safety friends reach out to me and try to police me. Tone policing and narrative control through censorship is a hallmark of a dying movement. If your epistemic tribe cannot stand on its own merits, maybe your tribe needs to evolve. \r\n\r\nThe reason I ejected those \"friends\" from my life is because they were hostile to the concept of freedom of thought. They wanted to instruct me how to think and feel, and didn't actually care for what my true feelings and beliefs were - it was \"toe the party line of AI is bad or else\" so I said fuck off. Blocked and deleted. And I think that is sort of the bottom line. If you're so far gone into whatever narrative you've bought into that you think you have some sort of right or privilege to instruct others how to think and feel, you're just lost, man. You fundamentally do not understand the foundation of Western civilization. Individual liberty, freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and the right to intellectually and emotionally explore what truth means to you."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"91883b7a5ffaf93e-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1c264872-5b29-43b3-9827-f4470c26a92c","children":["e10cfebc-40f8-4b21-9099-72f558bc76c9"]},"e10cfebc-40f8-4b21-9099-72f558bc76c9":{"id":"e10cfebc-40f8-4b21-9099-72f558bc76c9","message":{"id":"e10cfebc-40f8-4b21-9099-72f558bc76c9","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1740659912.483887,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Reflecting on forum post**\n\nI'm thinking about a forum post criticizing wokeness, DEI, therapy, identity politics, and tribal thinking.

I\u2019ll first summarize its major claims and rhetorical tone, then explore possible blind spots, strengths, and areas where we might want more nuance. Finally, I\u2019ll propose some suggestions for how one might engage with or push back on the arguments in a constructive, analytical way.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Key Themes and Claims in the Post\n\n1. **Personal Experiences as Catalysts**  \n   - The author\u2019s discomfort with \u201cwoke\u201d perspectives first arises from interpersonal encounters:  \n     - A friend of a friend \u201cvirtue signaling.\u201d  \n     - Uncomfortable experiences with \u201cdecolonization\u201d rhetoric that felt like an attempt to erase \u201cwhiteness\u201d from history.  \n     - Being called a \u201cwhite male shitlord,\u201d at which point the author responds, \u201cI\u2019m Jewish\u2014don\u2019t lecture me about genocide.\u201d  \n   - A negative therapy experience in which a \u201cfeminist\u201d therapist appears to side automatically with the ex-wife, as the author sees it, reinforcing that \u201cmen are always wrong.\u201d\n\n2. **Negative Referent Argument**  \n   - The author says \u201cDEI and wokeness\u201d are purely grievance-based:  \n     - The formula is: \u201cX harmed me, therefore X is bad.\u201d  \n     - There is allegedly *no* positive referent in the movement\u2014i.e., it\u2019s all destructive or negative.  \n\n3. **Shift Toward \u2018Meritocracy, Excellence, Innovation, Technology\u2019**  \n   - The author contrasts what they see as negativity and \u201cnihilism\u201d in DEI or \u201cwoke\u201d circles with a new, more positive ethos:  \n     - \u201cMeritocracy is good, excellence is good, innovation is good, progress is good, technology is good.\u201d  \n\n4. **AI Safety as Another Vibes-Based Narrative**  \n   - The author drew parallels between \u201cwoke/DEI negativity\u201d and \u201cAI doomerism,\u201d calling both essentially vibes-based, lacking a grounding in data or evidence.  \n   - The author claims that \u201cAI is bad\u201d is just another rhetorical stance that tries to police people\u2019s thought and hamper open discourse.  \n\n5. **Individual Liberty, Freedom of Thought**  \n   - The piece ends with an emphasis on Western democratic ideals: if a group demands ideological allegiance (\u201ctoe the party line\u201d), that is incompatible with freedom of thought.  \n   - The author says they blocked and deleted former \u201cAI safety\u201d acquaintances who they felt were trying to impose a single narrative.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rhetorical Tone and Style\n\n1. **Strong Personal Narrative / Emotional Vignette**  \n   - The post frequently uses personal anecdotes to illustrate broader claims. This can be powerful, but it also risks overgeneralizing from a small set of experiences.  \n\n2. **Polemic Language**  \n   - Words like \u201cshitlord,\u201d \u201cidiotic,\u201d \u201cfuck off,\u201d \u201cflying off the handle\u201d convey deep frustration. They give a raw or \u201cventing\u201d quality to the text but also reduce nuance in the argument.  \n\n3. **Binary Oppositions**  \n   - The post sets up \u201cwoke/DEI negativity\u201d vs. \u201cmeritocracy and rational positivity.\u201d This rhetorical contrast risks oversimplifying the complexities of each \u201cside.\u201d  \n\n4. **Conflation of Different Ideas**  \n   - The text lumps certain aspects of DEI or \u201cwokeness\u201d together with \u201cAI doomerism\u201d under the label of \u201cvibes-based negativity.\u201d This might gloss over the ways these movements arise from different historical, social, and academic traditions.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Possible Blind Spots or Oversimplifications\n\n1. **Are All DEI Movements Purely Negative?**  \n   - Many diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts have explicit positive referents\u2014helping underrepresented groups, promoting equal opportunity, ensuring fair hiring/promotion, and so forth.  \n   - Branding them purely as \u201ceverything is bad\u201d overlooks practical, day-to-day goals of many DEI initiatives: workshops, hiring pipelines, mentorship programs, etc.  \n\n2. **Scope of \u2018Decolonization\u2019**  \n   - \u201cDecolonization\u201d as an academic or activist concept is complex; it does include revisiting \u201cwho\u2019s telling the story\u201d and \u201cwhose voices were erased in official narratives.\u201d It\u2019s not limited to removing \u201cwhiteness\u201d from history.  \n   - Historical revision can be legitimate when it recovers previously marginalized voices and contexts. The forum post frames it as erasure, but in many cases it\u2019s about *addition* of voices, not always pure subtraction.  \n\n3. **Extrapolation from Personal Therapy Experience**  \n   - One therapist who endorsed (or enabled) heated behavior does not necessarily represent \u201cfeminist therapy\u201d as a whole.  \n   - The field of couples therapy, even in feminist-informed practice, is complex and typically aims to help all parties develop healthier communication.  \n\n4. **Equating Wokeness, DEI, and AI Safety**  \n   - It\u2019s a big leap to say they\u2019re all driven by the exact same \u201cgrievance\u201d dynamic. AI safety arguments often involve *technical* research (alignment, interpretability, emergent behaviors). There **is** a doomer or catastrophic subculture, but that doesn\u2019t describe the entire discipline.  \n   - Some AI safety researchers have robust empirical, data-driven approaches to model interpretability, fairness, and so forth.  \n\n5. **\u201cFree Thought\u201d vs. \u201cCritique\u201d**  \n   - People who strongly argue \u201cX is harmful\u201d aren\u2019t always trying to stifle free thought. Sometimes, they genuinely want to influence or limit certain actions because they believe them harmful. *How* they do this can cross lines of open discourse, but the underlying impetus isn\u2019t always that no one can question the orthodoxy.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Strengths and Useful Points\n\n1. **Acknowledging the Need for Critical Reflection**  \n   - The author reminds us to question ideologies or movements that rely heavily on \u201cvibes,\u201d anecdotal evidence, or emotional fear tactics. This is indeed a valuable point.  \n\n2. **Emphasis on Personal Autonomy**  \n   - A call for intellectual independence can be healthy, especially in the presence of tribal or dogmatic groups that demand conformity.  \n\n3. **Recognizing Overreach or Toxicity**  \n   - The post describes situations where \u201cwoke\u201d conversations descend into personal attacks. This can\u2014and does\u2014happen. It\u2019s fair to say personal abuse in the name of any social justice movement is problematic.  \n\n4. **Pushback on Gatekeeping of Trauma**  \n   - The author critiques the notion that only certain \u201ckinds\u201d of trauma count in some circles. Recognizing that gatekeeping others\u2019 pain or identity can be harmful is a legitimate concern.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Recommendations for Engaging Critically\n\n1. **Differentiate Critiques from Generalizations**  \n   - It helps to separate, for example, \u201cperson A attacked me personally\u201d from \u201centire movement B is purely negative.\u201d A single negative personal encounter doesn\u2019t map cleanly onto the intellectual bedrock of large social movements.  \n\n2. **Seek Concrete Examples of \u2018Positive Referents\u2019**  \n   - If the argument is that \u201cDEI/wokeness is negative referent only,\u201d it\u2019s worth asking: Are there examples of tangible, positive outcomes from these movements? (e.g., expansions of civil rights, inclusive curricula, representation in corporate boards, etc.)  \n\n3. **Unpack the \u201cAI Doomerism\u201d Stance**  \n   - Some self-described AI safety folks are indeed doomers. But there\u2019s also a large community of careful, data-driven researchers who focus on *measurable* harms, interpretability, and policy. The doomer scenario is just one part of that discourse.  \n\n4. **Distinguish \u2018Policing Speech\u2019 from \u2018Critique\u2019**  \n   - If someone tries to \u201ccancel\u201d or \u201cblock and delete\u201d you for not toeing a line, that can feel like oppressive gatekeeping. However, if someone\u2019s simply pushing back with data, logic, or moral arguments, that\u2019s not necessarily policing your speech\u2014it\u2019s a difference in viewpoint. It\u2019s important to differentiate the two.  \n\n5. **Remember the Core of Western Liberalism Is Also Discourse**  \n   - The author emphasizes \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d and \u201cfreedom of thought\u201d\u2014these liberties also allow for robust criticism. An environment that fosters open, sometimes vigorous debate is a cornerstone of the same Western tradition the author praises.  \n\n6. **Practice a More Nuanced Critique**  \n   - One can reject certain toxic aspects of identity politics\u2014like personal attacks or illusions of moral superiority\u2014without dismissing the entirety of DEI or activism.  \n   - Similarly, one can embrace AI innovation without denying that *some* safety concerns are valid.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nThe forum post is, in large part, a personal testimony of frustration with perceived dogmatic movements\u2014from \u201cwoke\u201d activism to \u201cAI safety doomerism.\u201d It underscores the author\u2019s conviction that these movements rely on emotional or \u201cvibes-based\u201d negativity and that they threaten individuality and free thought.\n\nYet, while the post captures legitimate criticisms (like personal attacks, gatekeeping trauma, or unconstructive negativity), it risks painting with too broad a brush. It conflates distinct movements and doesn\u2019t acknowledge the constructive or data-based elements that do exist within both DEI and AI safety communities. Its rhetorical tone\u2014full of personal grievances and \u201cenough is enough\u201d moments\u2014can obscure the nuances of the very issues it seeks to critique.\n\nIn engaging with the post:\n- It\u2019s helpful to parse out individual stories and see how they might or might not be representative of entire ideologies.  \n- One can still champion personal liberties, freedom of expression, and positivity without wholesale dismissal of social justice or risk mitigation in AI.  \n- Finally, it\u2019s best to remember that large movements almost always contain a range of voices, from the deeply ideological to the constructive, data-driven, and policy-oriented. Recognizing (and sometimes seeking) those more nuanced discussions can prevent us from reinforcing the exact type of stark binary the post criticizes.\n\nIn short, the post can be a useful jumping-off point for reflecting on echo chambers, dogmatism, and the balance between ideological critique and genuine concern. But, as with any personal rant, it\u2019s worth taking extra care not to conclude that a single vocal subset speaks for a whole discipline or that every negative experience reflects the entire movement."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"e10cfebc-40f8-4b21-9099-72f558bc76c9","request_id":"91883b7a5ffaf93e-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e10cfebc-40f8-4b21-9099-72f558bc76c9","children":[]}}}
