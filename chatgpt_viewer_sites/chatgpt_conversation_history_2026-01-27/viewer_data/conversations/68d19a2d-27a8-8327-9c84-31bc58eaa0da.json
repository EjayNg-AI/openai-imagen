You can poll for completion or subscribe to events/webhooks. This is explicitly recommended for models like **o3** and for multi-minute tasks such as deep research. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search7\ue202turn2search18\ue201\n\n2) Prefer **streaming** when you need interactive progress (and fewer perceived timeouts)  \n- Streaming is the standard pattern in production notes; it reduces the risk that a single long request hits a hard client/proxy timeout by delivering output incrementally as the model reasons and writes. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search19\ue202turn2search22\ue201\n\n3) If you do hit a timeout, **retry with backoff** (and consider raising client timeouts)  \n- The official error guide describes **APITimeoutError** and says to retry after a brief wait. In practice, you should implement exponential backoff and **increase the HTTP client timeout** if you expect long reasoning (especially without background mode/streaming). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n4) Keep requests \u201cright-sized\u201d for reasoning latency  \n- OpenAI\u2019s reasoning guides emphasize that these models can take longer; keep prompts concise and reserve tokens appropriately (i.e., don\u2019t bloat context). This reduces the window where timeouts occur and improves reliability. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue202turn1view2\ue201\n\n5) For multi-minute tool use (e.g., **deep research**, web search), **background mode** is the recommended path  \n- The deep-research guide calls out that these tasks \u201ccan run for several minutes\u201d and are **best used with background mode** to avoid timeouts and connectivity issues. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search7\ue201\n\n6) Operations inside **GPT Actions/Agents** have explicit timeout thresholds  \n- Production notes for GPT Actions specify concrete timeout limits for downstream API calls; design your tool calls beneath those thresholds or switch to background mode patterns for anything that may exceed them. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search8\ue201\n\n---\n\n### Minimal, production-oriented patterns\n\n- **Best default (long tasks):** Background mode + webhook  \n  - Kick off `responses.create({ background: true, ... })`, store the `response.id`, handle a completion webhook (or poll) and then fetch the final output. This avoids client and proxy timeouts entirely. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search4\ue201\n\n- **Best interactive UX:** Streaming  \n  - Use `stream=true` and render tokens as they arrive. This shortens perceived latency and reduces the chance of a connection timing out while waiting for a single large payload. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search22\ue201\n\n- **Fallbacks you should always add:**  \n  - **Retry** on `APITimeoutError` with exponential backoff.  \n  - **Increase SDK/client HTTP timeouts** when you deliberately avoid background mode and expect long generations. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n---\n\n### Quick decision guide\n\n- \u201cMy o3/o1-class call might take minutes.\u201d \u2192 Use **background mode** (plus webhook or polling). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search2\ue201  \n- \u201cI need the answer as it\u2019s produced, and it might be big.\u201d \u2192 **Stream** the response. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search22\ue201  \n- \u201cI still got a timeout.\u201d \u2192 **Retry** with backoff; consider **raising client timeout** or moving the call to **background mode**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can sketch a small Node/Python snippet showing both background mode + webhook and a streaming loop that\u2019s sane for o-series calls."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search7\ue202turn2search18\ue201","start_idx":543,"end_idx":602,"safe_urls":["https://openai.com/index/new-tools-and-features-in-the-responses-api/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/deep-research?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=responses&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Background mode - OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Background mode enables you to execute long-running tasks on models like o3 ...

In background mode, your initial POST returns immediately (status `queued`), so you\u2019re no longer bound by client/proxy timeouts. You don\u2019t need to set a timeout value on the long-running generation itself\u2014only on your short polling requests or your webhook receiver (which are quick). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search6\ue202turn6search1\ue201\n\nBelow are minimal, production-oriented patterns (Python + Node) copied straight from the official behavior described in the docs.\n\n---\n\n# 1) Fire-and-poll (no explicit timeout needed for the generation)\n\n### Python\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport time\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n# Kick off long-running reasoning task in background\nresp = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"o3\",                 # or your reasoning model\n    input=\"Do the multi-step analysis ...\",\n    background=True             # <-- key: background mode\n)\nrid = resp.id\n\n# Poll until complete\nwhile True:\n    r = client.responses.retrieve(rid)\n    if r.status in (\"completed\", \"failed\", \"cancelled\", \"incomplete\", \"expired\"):\n        break\n    time.sleep(2)  # short sleep between quick status checks\n\nif r.status == \"completed\":\n    # Extract output tokens\n    print(r.output_text)\nelse:\n    raise RuntimeError(f\"Background task ended with status={r.status}\")\n```\n\n### Node (TypeScript/JS)\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\n\nconst client = new OpenAI();\n\nconst start = await client.responses.create({\n  model: \"o3\",\n  input: \"Do the multi-step analysis ...\",\n  background: true,            // <-- key: background mode\n});\n\nconst id = start.id;\n\nwhile (true) {\n  const r = await client.responses.retrieve(id);\n  if ([\"completed\", \"failed\", \"cancelled\", \"incomplete\", \"expired\"].includes(r.status)) {\n    if (r.status !== \"completed\") throw new Error(`status=${r.status}`);\n    console.log(r.output_text);\n    break;\n  }\n  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 2000));\n}\n```\n\n- The docs explicitly say to **poll while status is `queued` or `in_progress`** and read the result when it becomes `completed`. Status values include `queued | in_progress | failed | completed | canceled` (and some surfaces also document `incomplete/expired`). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6search6\ue201  \n- This pattern **avoids setting any long request timeout** on the generation; your only network calls are fast `GET /responses/{id}` polls. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search6\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 2) Fire-and-webhook (best when you don\u2019t want to poll)\n\nConfigure a webhook and let OpenAI call you back when the background job finishes (event: **`response.completed`**; also handle `response.failed`). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn5search5\ue201\n\n### Kickoff (Python/Node are analogous)\n```python\nresp = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"o3\",\n    input=\"Do the multi-step analysis ...\",\n    background=True,\n    # If your project/webhook is configured in the dashboard, you don't need to pass URL here.\n    # Some integrations allow passing a webhook override in the request; prefer project config per docs.\n)\n```\n\n### Minimal webhook handler (Express)\n```ts\nimport express from \"express\";\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json()); // raw body if you verify signatures\n\napp.post(\"/openai/webhooks\", (req, res) => {\n  const event = req.body; // verify signature per docs before trusting!\n  // event.type is typically \"response.completed\" or \"response.failed\"\n  if (event.type === \"response.completed\") {\n    const response = event.data; // contains id, status=completed, output\n    // persist response.output_text (or items[]) to your DB / queue downstream processing\n  }\n  res.sendStatus(200);\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\n- OpenAI\u2019s **Webhooks guide** documents subscribing to background response events such as **`response.completed`**. This eliminates polling entirely and removes any need to set a timeout value for long generations. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn5search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 3) Do I really have to set any timeout number?\n\n- **For the long reasoning run**: **No**\u2014that\u2019s the point of background mode. Your long-lived work happens server-side; your client just receives an immediate `queued` response and later a quick poll result or webhook POST. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search6\ue201  \n- **For synchronous calls** (not using background): the SDKs/clients have defaults (commonly ~10 minutes). Official guidance for long tasks is to **use background mode** (or streaming) rather than trying to disable timeouts. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- **For polling**: keep the HTTP client\u2019s timeout modest (these are short GETs). Even if you never tune it, you\u2019re not waiting minutes on a single request\u2014your loop just retries. (If you *do* hit a timeout, the **Error Codes** page says: retry with backoff.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search18\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 4) When to prefer streaming instead\n\nIf you actually want the text as it\u2019s produced (interactive UX) and to reduce perceived timeouts for long outputs, use **streaming** (SSE). It\u2019s a separate technique from background mode; use it when you need progressive tokens in one live connection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n---\n\n## References (key, official)\n- **Background mode** overview and polling guidance. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search6\ue202turn6search1\ue201  \n- **Webhooks** and **`response.completed`** event for background results. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn5search5\ue201  \n- **Streaming responses** (SSE) for interactive output. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n- **Deep Research** guide explicitly recommending background mode for multi-minute tasks. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- **Error handling**: retry on `APITimeoutError`. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search18\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can tailor these snippets to your exact stack (FastAPI vs Express, webhook signature verification, retry/backoff policy, and a compact status table logger)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search6\ue202turn6search1\ue201","start_idx":384,"end_idx":416,"safe_urls":["https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Background mode - OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Background mode enables you to execute long-running tasks on models like o3 and o1-pro reliably, without having to worry about timeouts or other connectivity ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Background mode - OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"To check the status of background requests, use the GET endpoint for Responses.
