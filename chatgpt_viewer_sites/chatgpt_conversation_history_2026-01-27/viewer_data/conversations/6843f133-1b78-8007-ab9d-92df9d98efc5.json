A major driver in Europe has been ongoing immigration from Africa and the Middle East, which has sparked cultural and economic anxieties. Irregular migration to Europe surged in 2022\u20132023 \u2013 for example, **over 274,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean in 2023**, the highest in years\u301014\u2020L214-L222\u3011. This influx, combined with the legacy of the 2015 refugee crisis, has fed a narrative among some Europeans that their \u201cidentity\u201d is under threat. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell even warned of a \u201cjungle\u201d beyond Europe\u2019s \u201cgarden,\u201d framing migration as an invasive threat\u301014\u2020L119-L127\u3011. Such rhetoric, echoing colonial tropes, has reinforced a securitized view of immigration \u2013 more border fences, patrols, and deals with transit countries to keep migrants out\u301014\u2020L139-L148\u3011\u301014\u2020L175-L184\u3011. Far-right and populist parties have capitalized on these fears. Across the EU, national-conservative movements promote \u201cFortress Europe\u201d policies, pushing mainstream governments to adopt tougher stances on immigration\u301014\u2020L143-L151\u3011\u301014\u2020L149-L157\u3011. The result has been **rising anti-migrant and anti-minority sentiment**, often racializing Africans and Middle Easterners as the dangerous \u201cOther.\u201d This was tragically illustrated in France in 2023, where riots erupted after a police shooting of a North African-descent youth \u2013 a flashpoint revealing deep-seated racial tensions in post-pandemic Europe.\n\nCompounding these issues, the Israel\u2013Hamas war that erupted on October 7, 2023 unleashed a new wave of religious and ethnic polarization globally. **The Gaza war became a catalyst for both antisemitism and Islamophobia** in Western societies\u301022\u2020L55-L63\u3011\u301029\u2020L77-L85\u3011. After Hamas\u2019s brutal attack on Israeli civilians and Israel\u2019s military response in Gaza, mass protests and charged rhetoric spread across the US and Europe. In many European cities, large pro-Palestinian demonstrations filled the streets\u30106\u2020L619-L627\u3011, often led by Muslim communities and their allies rallying against the bombardment of Gaza. Simultaneously, Jewish communities and supporters of Israel held vigils and rallies highlighting Hamas\u2019s atrocities. These parallel mobilizations strained inter-communal relations. Each side feared and mistrusted the other: pro-Israel groups accused pro-Palestine protesters of harboring antisemitism or even celebrating terror, while pro-Palestine advocates felt their voices were being silenced and Muslim communities stigmatized as sympathetic to extremism\u301016\u2020L172-L180\u3011\u301016\u2020L188-L196\u3011.\n\n\u301032\u2020embed_image\u3011 *People take part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Israeli consulate in New York City on October 9, 2023, shortly after the war began. Such mass protests in the West highlighted growing societal divisions over the conflict.* \n\nHard evidence shows a **spike in hate incidents targeting both Jews and Muslims** since the war began. In the United States, authorities recorded more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the year following the Hamas attack \u2013 a **200%+ increase** over the prior year\u301022\u2020L47-L55\u3011\u301022\u2020L55-L63\u3011. Anti-Jewish hate crimes in major US cities jumped 48% in 2023, and anti-Muslim crimes rose 51%, with **sharp upticks starting immediately after October 7, 2023**\u301022\u2020L91-L97\u3011. Europe saw a similar pattern: the EU\u2019s Islamophobia envoy warned of \u201ca very clear rising trend\u201d of anti-Muslim hatred alongside anti-Jewish hostility, much of it proliferating on social media\u301029\u2020L77-L85\u3011. In the UK, for example, London\u2019s Mayor Sadiq Khan lamented an *\u201cappalling\u201d rise* in both antisemitic and Islamophobic attacks. **London police logged 139 anti-Jewish incidents and over 2,010 Islamophobic incidents in just the weeks after October 7**\u301033\u2020L1123-L1131\u3011\u301033\u2020L1123-L1131\u3011 \u2013 revealing that backlash against Muslim and Arab communities was, in this instance, even more widespread than anti-Jewish incidents. This dual surge in hatred has had a chilling effect on everyday life: many Jewish institutions in Europe increased security as bomb threats and vandalism climbed, while Muslims \u2013 from women wearing hijabs in France to Palestinian students in the US \u2013 reported feeling unsafe or targeted simply for their identity\u30106\u2020L678-L687\u3011\u30106\u2020L693-L699\u3011. \n\nThe Israel\u2013Gaza war\u2019s polarizing impact stems partly from how each new atrocity or tragedy is perceived through communal lenses. Graphic news of civilian deaths in Gaza fueled anger and despair in Muslim and pro-Palestinian circles, sometimes boiling over into harsh anti-Israel slogans at rallies. Meanwhile, horrifying accounts of Hamas\u2019s massacres stirred fear and trauma in Jewish communities worldwide. Instead of uniting people against violence, these events often deepened the **\u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality**. European officials, under public pressure, sometimes reacted by implicitly **\u201cothering\u201d Muslim populations \u2013 conflating their solidarity with Palestinians with extremism**. In Germany, for instance, the vice-chancellor in November 2023 demanded that Muslim residents publicly distance themselves from Hamas and warned that non-citizens engaging in pro-Hamas or antisemitic acts would risk deportation\u301033\u2020L1168-L1176\u3011\u301033\u2020L1178-L1185\u3011. In the UK, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak similarly pledged a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach: foreign students or visitors who \u201cspew hate\u201d at protests were threatened with removal from the country\u301033\u2020L1100-L1108\u3011\u301033\u2020L1103-L1107\u3011. Such measures, ostensibly to combat extremism, fed a perception among Muslims that they were collectively viewed with suspicion. Human Rights Watch noted European politicians\u2019 appeals \u201ccalling on Muslims to make public declarations\u201d against antisemitism and Hamas \u2013 a stance that **unfairly treats Muslim communities as a monolith responsible for events in the Middle East**\u30106\u2020L699-L708\u3011. All of these factors \u2013 pandemic-era social strains, contentious immigration debates, and the raw fallout from the Gaza war \u2013 have intertwined to produce a highly polarized atmosphere marked by heightened racial and religious tensions.\n\n## Prominent Groups Exacerbating vs. Responding to Tensions\n\nMultiple groups and movements have played key roles in either **inflaming these divisions or trying to bridge them**. On the one hand are forces that exploit fear and grievances for political or ideological ends. Foremost among these are **far-right nationalist parties in Europe**, which have gained momentum by demonizing immigrants and minorities. For example, France\u2019s National Rally (RN) and Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) regularly blame African and Middle Eastern immigrants for crime and social ills, stoking public resentment. The AfD \u2013 now polling as high as second place in Germany \u2013 has even proposed mass **\u201cremigration\u201d** (deportation) of foreigners, with its leader vowing to expel migrants en masse if the party comes to power\u301014\u2020L147-L155\u3011. Such parties, along with Italy\u2019s League and Brothers of Italy, Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, and others, have mainstreamed anti-immigrant rhetoric. In at least six EU countries, radical right leaders have entered government as of 2024 (including Italy and Finland), pushing anti-refugee policies from within\u301014\u2020L143-L151\u3011. **Far-right street movements and militias** also contribute: groups like Pegida in Germany and Britain First in the UK (as well as white supremacist and neo-Nazi factions in the US) hold rallies rife with anti-Muslim and racist slogans. Observers note that at these marches, chants and banners routinely feature antisemitic tropes, anti-Black racism, and anti-migrant hate speech \u2013 creating an atmosphere of intimidation for minorities\u30106\u2020L652-L660\u3011\u30106\u2020L653-L657\u3011. The **MAGA movement in the United States**, led by Donald Trump\u2019s hardline base, similarly centers on nativist, anti-immigrant themes (e.g. calls to ban Muslims or build border walls) and has amplified racial grievances, from discrediting Black Lives Matter protesters to downplaying right-wing extremist violence. These actors thrive on polarization: **by portraying multicultural, liberal society as being under siege**, they rally supporters through fear, often with scant regard for facts or nuance.\n\nOther entities aggravating tensions include certain voices within the Israel\u2013Palestine conflict debate. For instance, some **extreme pro-Palestinian student groups and activists** have used incendiary rhetoric that spills into antisemitism. A notable example occurred on US college campuses: the National Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) network organized an October 2023 \u201cDay of Resistance\u201d rally and praised the Hamas attacks as a \u201chistoric win for the Palestinian resistance\u201d\u301016\u2020L188-L196\u3011. Such statements \u2013 effectively glorifying the murder of Israeli civilians \u2013 deeply alarmed Jewish students and faculty, who saw the rallies as *\u201ccelebrating the raping, kidnapping and slaughtering of our people,\u201d* in the words of one Columbia University protester\u301016\u2020L174-L182\u3011\u301016\u2020L192-L200\u3011. The controversy at Harvard University was another flashpoint: more than 30 Harvard student organizations signed an open letter **blaming Israel entirely for the violence** on October 7, which sparked outrage nationally\u301018\u2020L238-L247\u3011. Prominent alumni and CEOs accused those student groups of excusing terrorism; a truck was even sent to drive around campus displaying the names and photos of the signatories, effectively doxxing them\u301018\u2020L283-L292\u3011. These episodes illustrate how campus-based groups, ostensibly advocating for a cause, sometimes **exacerbate divisions by crossing into extreme or insensitive positions**, triggering backlash. On the opposite side, certain hardline pro-Israel organizations have also inflamed tensions \u2013 for example, by labeling virtually any criticism of Israeli military actions as antisemitism and pushing institutions to punish pro-Palestinian speech. In Florida, a state university board officially suspended a chapter of SJP, absurdly claiming the group provided \u201csupport\u201d to a terrorist organization simply for its protest activities. Such moves fuel the perception among Muslim and Arab communities that they are being collectively punished and muzzled for their views.\n\nCounterbalancing these agitators are **advocacy organizations, student groups, and civil society movements that work to reduce polarization and address hatred**. In the United States, longstanding civil rights organizations have mobilized in response to the uptick in bigotry. The *Anti-Defamation League (ADL)*, a Jewish advocacy group, has been meticulously tracking antisemitic incidents and sounding the alarm about the *\u201cmassive spike\u201d* in antisemitism since Oct 7, 2023\u301022\u2020L51-L59\u3011\u301022\u2020L93-L100\u3011. The ADL and other Jewish organizations (like the American Jewish Committee) have organized public campaigns and solidarity events to condemn hate while distinguishing legitimate criticism of Israeli policies from antisemitic prejudice. Simultaneously, *Muslim advocacy groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)* have been at the forefront of combating Islamophobia. CAIR has documented the surge in anti-Muslim bias incidents \u2013 from mosque vandalizations to women in hijab being harassed \u2013 and has pressed law enforcement and lawmakers to protect Muslim communities\u2019 rights. Notably, a **broad coalition of interfaith and anti-hate groups** formed in late 2023 to address these dual challenges. For example, in November 2023, dozens of civil society organizations in the US (Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and secular) issued joint statements denouncing both antisemitism and anti-Muslim bigotry, emphasizing that the two must be fought together. This reflects an important effort to **push back against the \u201cus vs. them\u201d narrative and replace it with unity**.\n\nOn campuses and in cities, many student and community-led initiatives have sought to heal rifts. At Brown University, Jewish and Palestinian students came together for a vigil mourning *all* civilian lives lost \u2013 an attempt to model empathy amidst division\u301015\u2020L29-L34\u3011. Similar dialogue circles and teach-ins have been hosted at universities like Stanford and Georgetown, where students of diverse backgrounds share personal perspectives on the conflict in a moderated, respectful setting. In Europe too, grassroots organizations have stepped up. *SOS Racisme* in France and *Hope Not Hate* in the UK are examples of NGOs that monitor hate crimes and assist victims; they also run educational programs to debunk racist myths (for instance, explaining the realities of immigration to counter \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d conspiracy claims). When far-right marches took place in France in late 2023 with openly xenophobic slogans, anti-fascist groups organized counter-protests and urged authorities to apply hate speech laws equally \u2013 not just cracking down on pro-Palestine rallies but also on ultra-nationalist ones\u30106\u2020L651-L659\u3011. Additionally, mainstream **student unions and professional associations** have sometimes filled the breach left by polarized politics. For example, the British Medical Association spoke out against rising anti-migrant sentiment, noting the invaluable contributions of immigrant doctors and nurses during the pandemic \u2013 a reminder of shared humanity intended to cool racial tensions.\n\nIn summary, the **landscape of polarization features a tug-of-war between divisive forces and conciliatory forces**. Far-right politicians, extremist activists, and online agitators drive wedges by vilifying entire communities (immigrants, Muslims, Jews, Black Americans, etc.) or by embracing absolutist, exclusionary narratives. Meanwhile, human rights advocates, interfaith leaders, student bridge-builders, and other concerned groups strive to counteract this by promoting dialogue and protecting targeted minorities. The ongoing challenge is that the voices of moderation and unity often struggle to be heard above the din of outrage amplified by media and politics \u2013 yet their role is crucial in mitigating the worst effects of polarization.\n\n## Government and Societal Reactions\n\nGovernments in the US and Europe have responded to these rising tensions with a mix of **hardline policies, public reassurances, and controversial measures**, reflecting the delicate balance between security and civil liberties. In the United States, the post-pandemic period saw a hardened official stance on illegal immigration, especially under the influence of Donald Trump. After campaigning on claims of \u201cinvasion\u201d at the southern border, Trump returned to the White House in January 2025 and promptly launched a sweeping immigration crackdown\u301012\u2020L195-L203\u3011\u301012\u2020L203-L210\u3011. He **deployed military troops to the US\u2013Mexico border** and reallocated federal agents to ramp up arrests of undocumented migrants\u301012\u2020L197-L205\u3011. By March 2025, his administration touted that border crossings had plummeted to the lowest in decades\u301012\u2020L207-L214\u3011. Trump also moved against legal immigration avenues: he tried to **freeze refugee admissions** entirely and even issued an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants\u301012\u2020L201-L208\u3011. In a striking intersection of foreign conflict and domestic policy, Trump ordered visas and green cards revoked for some foreign students who had participated in pro-Palestinian protests\u301012\u2020L201-L208\u3011. (This followed calls by some Republican lawmakers in late 2023 to **deport non-citizen students who expressed support for Hamas**, a stance Trump embraced.) Such actions delighted his political base \u2013 polls showed immigration became his strongest issue, with about half of Americans approving of his approach\u301012\u2020L171-L179\u3011\u301012\u2020L183-L190\u3011. However, civil liberties groups like the ACLU fiercely criticized these measures as unconstitutional and discriminatory. They warn that **sweeping draconian actions \u2013 from mass deportation pushes to targeting protesters \u2013 threaten fundamental rights**, and have challenged many in court.\n\nNot all US leaders responded in the same vein. President Joe Biden, during the final year of his term (2023), took a more measured tone. In the aftermath of Oct 7, 2023, the Biden administration condemned antisemitism forcefully \u2013 unveiling new initiatives to combat hate crimes against Jews \u2013 *while also cautioning against Islamophobia*\u301022\u2020L59-L66\u3011\u301022\u2020L62-L64\u3011. Biden met with Muslim community representatives and publicly acknowledged the suffering of Palestinian civilians, aiming for a balanced approach. Still, societal divisions were evident. On Capitol Hill, polarization deepened as lawmakers split along partisan lines over the Gaza war and border policy. Some Republican-led states took matters into their own hands: Texas Governor Greg Abbott, for instance, intensified state border enforcement and continued busing asylum-seekers to Democratic-run cities as a political statement. In society at large, **large-scale protests and demonstrations became a defining feature of reaction**. American cities saw some of the biggest pro-Palestine rallies in decades \u2013 tens of thousands marched in New York, Washington, DC, Chicago, and elsewhere through late 2023, chanting for a Gaza ceasefire and an end to racial/religious profiling of Arabs and Muslims. Equally, there were significant pro-Israel gatherings: in November 2023, an estimated 290,000 people rallied at the National Mall in Washington, DC in a \u201cMarch for Israel,\u201d many carrying American and Israeli flags and urging action against antisemitism\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011. These parallel mass mobilizations \u2013 one calling attention to Palestinian suffering, the other to Jewish suffering \u2013 epitomized the divided narrative. Both were largely peaceful, but sporadic incidents occurred (e.g. scuffles at some campus protests, or a few cases of vandalism of synagogues and mosques, quickly condemned by officials).\n\nIn Europe, government responses have varied by country but generally trended toward **tighter immigration controls and enhanced security measures** amid the polarizing climate. Several European governments led by conservative or centrist coalitions moved to harden their borders. For example, Italy under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni declared a state of emergency in 2023 as boat migrant arrivals hit new highs, and pressed the EU for more help in blocking departures from North Africa. The EU itself reached controversial agreements \u2013 such as a deal with Tunisia in mid-2023 \u2013 trading financial aid for Tunisia\u2019s cooperation in stopping migrant boats\u301014\u2020L175-L184\u3011\u301014\u2020L179-L187\u3011. By May 2024, EU member states approved a new **Pact on Migration and Asylum** aimed at accelerating asylum processing and deportations of those deemed \u201cnot eligible\u201d for protection\u301014\u2020L215-L223\u3011\u301014\u2020L217-L224\u3011. While touted as a *\u201cEuropean solution\u201d*, this pact imposes quotas or payments on countries to accept relocated asylum seekers and will enforce returns more strictly, essentially reinforcing the **\u201cFortress Europe\u201d** approach. Human rights observers note that such measures do little to address root causes of migration and may simply push refugees into more perilous routes (2023 saw the most migrant drownings in the Mediterranean since 2017)\u301014\u2020L214-L222\u3011\u301014\u2020L225-L232\u3011.\n\nIndividual nations implemented their own controls as well. **Border checks were temporarily reinstated inside the Schengen free-travel zone** \u2013 Austria continued controls on its Hungarian border, France and Belgium boosted checks due to terrorism concerns, and Germany imposed new checks on the Polish and Czech borders in late 2023 to curb unauthorized entries\u301014\u2020L149-L157\u3011. Germany\u2019s government, although center-left, justified tighter borders as necessary to *\u201cprotect against the acute dangers posed by Islamist terrorism and serious crime\u201d*, explicitly linking migration routes to security after the Hamas attacks\u301014\u2020L149-L157\u3011. In France, where a knife attack by a radicalized asylum-seeker occurred in October 2023 amid the Israel\u2013Hamas war, Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin seized the moment to advocate a **tough new immigration law**. He tied the incident to the conflict and pushed to make it easier to expel foreign nationals with suspected \u201cradical\u201d links\u30106\u2020L699-L708\u3011. Indeed, the French government in early 2024 drafted a bill (hotly debated in Parliament) that would streamline deportations of undocumented migrants who commit crimes or are on extremism watchlists\u30106\u2020L703-L709\u3011. **This conflation of external conflict with domestic policy** drew criticism from rights groups, who argued that one community was being scapegoated \u201cfor the failure of European governments to effectively address antisemitism\u201d or other issues\u30106\u2020L705-L713\u3011.\n\nPerhaps the most high-profile European reaction was the clampdown on demonstrations related to the Gaza war. Initially, some governments responded to massive pro-Palestinian protests with **blanket bans or heavy-handed policing**. In France, authorities tried to ban pro-Palestine rallies outright in October 2023, citing risks of violence or antisemitic chants. This led to public outcry and was eventually overturned by courts on free speech grounds, allowing gatherings to resume in places like Paris\u30106\u2020L619-L627\u3011. The UK and Germany did not ban protests entirely but adopted strict postures: British ministers warned that waving certain flags or chanting certain slogans (like \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u201d) could be treated as hate speech or support for terrorism\u30102\u2020L67-L75\u3011\u30102\u2020L65-L73\u3011. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police greatly increased its presence at protest marches, and at times tensions ran high as officers made a number of arrests for suspected incitement. In Germany, authorities went so far as to **ban symbols associated with Palestinian solidarity** \u2013 reports emerged that displaying the keffiyeh scarf, Palestinian flag colors, or even \u201cFree Palestine\u201d stickers could lead to police action in some instances\u30102\u2020L123-L131\u3011\u30102\u2020L119-L127\u3011. This was part of Germany\u2019s broader effort to crack down on what some politicians termed \u201cimported antisemitism\u201d from immigrant communities\u301033\u2020L1198-L1205\u3011\u301033\u2020L1200-L1208\u3011. Such moves were extremely controversial: Muslim and Arab community leaders felt their freedom of expression was being curtailed and that genuine peaceful protest was being conflated with extremism. Human Rights Watch admonished European governments *\u201cnot to create double standards\u201d* \u2013 noting that while pro-Palestinian gatherings were met with bans and dispersals, far-right marches spouting anti-migrant and antisemitic vitriol often proceeded with less interference\u30106\u2020L651-L660\u3011.\n\nSocietal reactions in Europe mirrored these official currents. **Public opinion has become more polarized**, with a segment demanding more restrictive immigration and strong support of Israel, and another segment pushing for refugee rights and justice for Palestinians. This polarization has influenced politics: in the Netherlands, for instance, the November 2023 general election saw the surprising victory of an anti-immigrant party vowing to halt asylum completely. In Germany, the AfD\u2019s poll numbers climbed throughout 2023\u20132024, reflecting discontent with the ruling coalition\u2019s migration policies and its stance of solidarity with Israel. Conversely, in places like Ireland and Spain, large pro-Palestinian demonstrations indicated sympathy for the Palestinian cause among the public, putting pressure on those governments to criticize Israeli military actions. Europe also saw displays of unity against hate: in Berlin, thousands marched in a December 2023 **\u201cNo to Antisemitism, No to Islamophobia\u201d** rally that brought Jewish and Muslim groups together, backed by city officials, as a rebuttal to the fear spreading in their communities. Likewise, after a firebomb attack on a synagogue in Berlin and an attempted arson at a mosque in France, there were widespread denunciations and visible increases in police protection for religious sites. Many European leaders, from King Charles III in the UK to Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany, made a point of visiting synagogues and mosques to show solidarity with both Jews and Muslims who felt under threat.\n\nIn summary, **governments have walked a tightrope**: ramping up security and control in the face of populist pressure, while trying to maintain democratic values. The US under Trump embraced an unabashedly hardline approach (mass deportations, travel bans, protest crackdowns), whereas European responses blended tougher immigration enforcement with selective suppression of what authorities viewed as extremist expressions. Society at large has been highly reactive \u2013 with massive protests, counter-protests, and a general atmosphere of contention. Each policy choice, whether building a wall or banning a march, has tended to further inflame one side of the divide or the other. The challenge going forward is whether more balanced approaches can be found that address legitimate security concerns and social frustrations **without undermining pluralism and fundamental rights**.\n\n## Media Narratives, Social Media Bias, and Propaganda vs. Facts\n\nThe media \u2013 both traditional news outlets and social media platforms \u2013 have played a **pivotal role in framing these polarizing events**, often with contested credibility. In the age of instant information, the narrative that people absorb is heavily influenced by where they get their news. **Traditional media in the West have faced accusations of bias from all sides**. During the Gaza war and related tensions, many pro-Palestinian observers lambasted mainstream outlets (CNN, BBC, The New York Times, etc.) for what they perceive as a pro-Israel slant. They argue that Western media gave significantly more weight and empathy to Israeli victims while downplaying or \u201ccontextualizing\u201d the deaths of Palestinian civilians. In fact, journalists from CNN and the BBC \u2013 speaking anonymously to Al Jazeera\u2019s media watchdog program \u2013 revealed that their own newsroom managers sometimes applied double standards\u301026\u2020L106-L114\u3011\u301026\u2020L115-L123\u3011. According to these accounts, senior editors were **reluctant to scrutinize Israeli officials** as rigorously as they would other governments. One CNN journalist recounted an \u201cembarrassing\u201d incident where the network aired an Israeli army spokesperson\u2019s claim about Hamas using a Gaza hospital as a base \u2013 showcasing an Arabic document purportedly as a Hamas \u201cguard roster\u201d \u2013 when in reality it was just a patient schedule calendar on the wall\u301026\u2020L127-L135\u3011\u301026\u2020L139-L147\u3011. Arabic-literate staff had warned it was not what the military claimed, but the live report went ahead uncorrected, effectively **broadcasting Israeli propaganda as fact**\u301026\u2020L139-L147\u3011\u301026\u2020L148-L156\u3011. Corrections, if issued, received far less visibility. Similarly, there were internal directives like *\u201cdon\u2019t call it an airstrike unless Israel confirms it\u201d* when reporting on Gaza bombings, rules that reporters said would never be imposed in other conflicts (e.g., *\u201cwe wouldn\u2019t ask the Russians to verify they bombed a hospital in Kyiv\u201d*)\u301026\u2020L165-L173\u3011\u301026\u2020L167-L170\u3011. Such practices erode audience trust. Indeed, surveys show trust in media is at a low ebb \u2013 many believe outlets push a particular political agenda or narrative rather than unbiased facts.\n\nAt the same time, conservative and right-wing critics allege that media elites have a liberal or \u201cpolitically correct\u201d bias, especially on issues of race and immigration. They point to instances like major US newspapers supporting Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 but, in their view, not giving equal coverage to crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. In Europe, right-leaning tabloids and TV channels (such as the UK\u2019s *Daily Mail* or Italy\u2019s *Rete 4*) often spin stories to highlight immigrant criminality or to cast doubt on refugees\u2019 motives, which feeds polarization. The result is a **media ecosystem of dueling narratives**: one segment of outlets emphasizes threats (terrorism, crime, \u201cno-go zones\u201d of migrants, etc.) while another segment emphasizes tolerance and the plight of marginalized groups \u2013 and consumers gravitate to the version that fits their preconceptions. The Gaza war coverage encapsulated this: depending on the channel, viewers heard either about Hamas\u2019s brutality and Israel\u2019s right to self-defense with little mention of Palestinian suffering, or about Israeli bombardment and Palestinian rights with relatively little about Hamas\u2019s terror. This selective framing led each side of the public debate to accuse the other of falling for *\u201cpropaganda.\u201d* It has also opened space for **state-backed propaganda and conspiracy theories**. Russian and Chinese media, for example, eagerly amplified Western failures \u2013 highlighting European protest bans or US campus controversies \u2013 to portray Western societies as hypocritical and in chaos.\n\nIf legacy media struggles with bias and credibility, **social media has been an even more chaotic battleground for truth**. Platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok became flooded with content about the Israel\u2013Hamas war and related tensions \u2013 much of it unverified. From the first hours of the Hamas attack, misinformation proliferated online at an alarming rate. Notably, Elon Musk\u2019s X platform came under intense scrutiny. Musk had drastically cut back X\u2019s content moderation teams after acquiring the company, and in 2023 he withdrew from the EU\u2019s voluntary code of practice on disinformation\u301024\u2020L203-L211\u3011\u301024\u2020L207-L215\u3011. When war broke out, X **failed to adequately curb false and manipulated content**, drawing a sharp warning from the European Union. EU officials notified Musk in an October 10 letter that X was being used to disseminate \u201cfake news and repurposed old images\u201d about the Israel\u2013Hamas conflict \u2013 including recycled photos from past wars and even footage from video games misrepresented as real-time war videos\u301024\u2020L193-L201\u3011\u301024\u2020L197-L204\u3011. They reminded him that under the new Digital Services Act, X could face hefty fines (up to 6% of global revenue) or even an *EU-wide blackout* if it didn\u2019t promptly remove illegal disinformation and hate content\u301024\u2020L175-L183\u3011\u301024\u2020L179-L187\u3011. Musk\u2019s public response \u2013 *\u201cPlease list the violations\u2026 so the public can see them\u201d* \u2013 was seen as flippant\u301024\u2020L209-L217\u3011. Indeed, watchdog groups reported that **X became a super-spreader of war misinformation**. \n\nA detailed investigation by *ProPublica* and Columbia University found that **\u201cverified\u201d accounts on X \u2013 which now simply means paid subscribers, not vetted sources \u2013 were major conduits of false claims**\u301027\u2020L79-L88\u3011\u301027\u2020L123-L131\u3011. In just the first month of the war, over 2,000 tweets from blue-check accounts pushed more than 200 distinct misleading narratives, collectively garnering **over 500 million views**\u301027\u2020L144-L152\u3011\u301027\u2020L146-L154\u3011. Examples abound: a viral video of a sobbing boy screaming \u201cmy sisters have died\u201d was shared as if from Gaza in 2023, but was actually footage from Syria years ago\u301027\u2020L101-L109\u3011\u301027\u2020L123-L131\u3011. Another widely circulated clip purported to show Israel\u2019s new \u201cIron Beam\u201d laser defense in action \u2013 in reality it was from a military-themed video game\u301027\u2020L110-L118\u3011\u301027\u2020L123-L131\u3011. And amid the fog of the hospital bombing in Gaza on Oct 17, one verified account pretending to be an official Israeli source posted a fake screenshot \u201cproving\u201d Israel had warned the hospital before striking it, which was entirely fabricated\u301027\u2020L117-L125\u3011\u301027\u2020L124-L132\u3011. These posts racked up millions of views *long before any fact-checking could catch up*. X\u2019s community fact-check system (Community Notes) eventually flagged many of these falsehoods, but the corrections reached a tiny fraction of the audience; for instance, notes on two particularly viral fake posts got only ~900k views versus 6+ million views for the original lies\u301027\u2020L129-L137\u3011\u301027\u2020L133-L141\u3011. In the meantime, **emotive misinformation stoked outrage and fear** \u2013 each side in the conflict found \u201cevidence\u201d on social media to reinforce its perspective, be it false atrocities attributed to the other or exaggerated claims of heroism by their own side. The platform\u2019s design (amplifying content with high engagement) meant that the most inflammatory and divisive material often spread the fastest, while nuanced or factual posts struggled to gain traction.\n\nOther platforms faced similar challenges. TikTok and Instagram were deluged with war montages and martyr videos, some containing graphic violence or extremist propaganda that moderators raced to remove. Meta (Facebook/Instagram\u2019s parent company) said it removed or labeled thousands of pieces of content glorifying Hamas or spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories, but critics noted that plenty slipped through, especially in non-English languages. YouTube took down channels associated with Hamas and ramped up warnings on videos, yet algorithmic rabbit holes still sometimes steered users to partisan or conspiratorial content. A concerning trend was the rise of **impersonation and fake experts**: accounts masquerading as news outlets or authorities pumped out fabricated \u201cscoops\u201d (for example, a fake CNN tweet about Iran deploying troops, which went viral before being debunked). The *information war* extended to state actors as well \u2013 Israeli official social media accounts posted graphic images of Hamas atrocities in an effort to rally global opinion, while Hamas\u2019s media wing released videos and statements framing their actions as heroic resistance. Each had willing amplifiers: pro-Israel and pro-Palestine activists worldwide eagerly shared material favoring their side, often without verification. \n\nThis all raises the question: **how much of the current narrative is propaganda versus fact?** The uncomfortable truth is that it is often a mix, and separating them requires careful, critical media consumption. A great deal of what average people encounter \u2013 especially on social feeds \u2013 is packaged by interest groups or influencers with agendas. For instance, some of the dramatic stories that went viral in October 2023 later turned out false or unproven (the tale of 40 babies beheaded by Hamas fighters spread like wildfire, cited even by presidents, before being partly walked back). In Europe\u2019s immigration debates, similarly, propaganda has played a role: far-right networks spread sensationalized stories (sometimes outright hoaxes) about migrant crimes or \u201cno-go\u201d migrant neighborhoods, which then gain traction in mainstream discourse. Conversely, there is also propaganda from the other side \u2013 for example, narratives that *all* law enforcement is racist or that *all* concerns about immigration are rooted in bigotry, which gloss over legitimate complexities. Social media\u2019s algorithm-driven echo chambers tend to reinforce existing biases: users see more of what they already agree with, a phenomenon that both Twitter\u2019s X and Facebook\u2019s engagement-focused algorithms have been criticized for. This amplification of **confirmation bias** means propaganda often falls on very receptive ears, while fact-checks and nuanced reporting struggle to penetrate.\n\nFacing these issues, platforms and policymakers are experimenting with solutions. The EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2013 mentioned earlier \u2013 is one attempt to hold tech companies accountable, forcing them to be more transparent and proactive about content moderation or face penalties\u301024\u2020L175-L183\u3011\u301024\u2020L179-L187\u3011. Some social media sites have updated policies: X introduced *Community Notes* crowdsourced fact checks (helpful, but as noted, not always quick or widespread enough), and Meta temporarily adjusted algorithms to reduce the spread of graphic war content and misinformation during the Gaza conflict. YouTube and Facebook also partnered more closely with fact-checking organizations to debunk viral falsehoods about the war. However, these measures have had mixed success. Critics point out that **platforms profit from engagement** \u2013 and outrage or fear is highly engaging \u2013 so there are inherent conflicts of interest in truly clamping down on polarizing content. Moreover, moderation itself can become politicized: both left and right accuse platforms of bias in whose content gets removed or down-ranked. For example, pro-Palestinian activists complained that Instagram unfairly removed or hid posts showing Gaza casualties (under the guise of graphic content rules), while conservatives have long accused Twitter and Facebook of censoring anti-immigrant or anti-transgender opinions. \n\nIn evaluating how narratives are shaped, one must note that **traditional media still provide much of the raw information that then gets remixed online**, but their framing can introduce bias. Social media then magnifies and distorts that information through a lens of viral trends, peer influence, and targeted propaganda. The end result in this post-pandemic, highly polarized era is a populace that often cannot even agree on basic facts, let alone interpretations. Was a given protest mostly peaceful or mostly violent? Did the police overreact or show restraint? Different media will give different impressions. **Propaganda finds fertile ground when trust in media is low** \u2013 and indeed, propagandists intentionally sow distrust (\u201cfake news media!\u201d) so that people turn to partisan outlets or unofficial channels where propaganda can circulate unchecked.\n\nUltimately, discerning fact from spin requires critical thinking and cross-checking sources, but in a climate of polarization, many people lack the time or willingness to do so. Social media companies, for their part, are under pressure to tighten moderation of *blatantly false content and hate speech*, and some have begun to do so in fits and starts. Yet, moderation alone cannot solve the fundamental issue: **deep societal cleavages mean that even true facts are interpreted through partisan lenses**. When one side\u2019s factual hero is the other side\u2019s villain, accusations of bias are inevitable. What is clear is that both traditional and social media have amplified polarizing content \u2013 sometimes unwittingly, sometimes through negligence \u2013 and that has significantly shaped public perception of racial and religious conflicts. The task ahead for media institutions is to rebuild credibility through accuracy and fairness, and for social platforms to rein in the flood of disinformation and extremist content without stifling genuine discourse. In a world where a viral lie can travel far faster than the truth, the narrative of events is often *\u201cshaped by propaganda\u201d* to a troubling degree\u301025\u2020L11-L18\u3011. Countering that will require sustained effort from journalists, tech companies, and consumers alike to privilege verifiable facts over incendiary memes and to restore a shared baseline of reality in our public conversations. \n\n**Sources:** The analysis above is based on a variety of credible sources, including reports from Human Rights Watch\u30106\u2020L652-L660\u3011\u30106\u2020L699-L708\u3011, data and statements cited in Reuters\u301012\u2020L201-L208\u3011\u301012\u2020L171-L179\u3011, *The Guardian*\u301016\u2020L172-L180\u3011\u301018\u2020L283-L292\u3011, *Al Jazeera*\u301014\u2020L143-L151\u3011\u301026\u2020L127-L135\u3011, *Axios*\u301022\u2020L55-L63\u3011\u301022\u2020L91-L97\u3011, *ProPublica*\u301027\u2020L123-L131\u3011\u301027\u2020L129-L137\u3011, and academic analyses\u301033\u2020L1123-L1131\u3011\u301033\u2020L1168-L1176\u3011, among others, to ensure a balanced, fact-based perspective on these developments.

Large pro-Palestinian protests (some overtly praising Hamas)\n\n| What is happening | How common? | How it is covered |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **Student-led Gaza-war encampments** that swept ~140 U.S. and dozens of European campuses in 2024\u201325 | Widespread. Over 3 000 arrests on >60 U.S. campuses; encampments in at least 25 countries by May 2024 \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201 | Mainstream outlets and university inquiries show that most protests were peaceful, but a **small, vocal subset used Hamas slogans or the red \u201cresistance\u201d triangle**. Washington Post, for example, documented chants glorifying the Oct-7 attacks at a handful of U.S. universities \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 |\n| **City-centre marches** in London, Paris, Berlin, New York, etc. | Very large but episodic. UK police logged 1.3 million participants across 15 London marches between Oct 2023 and Apr 2025; German rallies similarly drew tens of thousands. | European authorities generally allowed the marches but cracked down on explicitly pro-Hamas symbols (e.g., Germany\u2019s nationwide ban on the Qassam Brigades flag).  |\n\n*Take-away:* Explicit Hamas support exists but is **not representative of most pro-Palestinian demonstrators**; footage highlighting it is often clipped from the loudest fringes.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Campus protests said to \u201charass Jewish students\u201d\n\n* **Official findings:**  \n  * In June 2025 the U.S. Department of Education told Columbia University\u2019s accreditor that the school showed \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to *documented* antisemitic harassment during the protests \ue200cite\ue202turn14news9\ue201.  \n  * ADL\u2019s 2024 campus audit recorded sharp rises in swastika vandalism, doxxing trucks and intimidation at ~20 U.S. institutions.\n\n* **Student-rights groups counter-claim** selective policing and Islamophobia (e.g., Columbia\u2019s own Senate \u201cSundial\u201d report chronicled doxxing and threats against Palestinian students as well) \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201.\n\n*Prevalence:* Antisemitic incidents on U.S. campuses tripled after 7 Oct 2023, but they remain concentrated at a handful of high-profile universities (Columbia, NYU, UCLA, Berkeley).\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Public street prayers blocking traffic\n\n* Viral clips of Paris boulevards filled with worshippers are **mostly historical** (2010\u20132017 protests over mosque closures). Fact-checkers show the same videos resurfacing every few months with new captions \ue200cite\ue202turn6search8\ue202turn6search6\ue201.  \n* Since France started issuing fines and expanding prayer-hall capacity in 2018, large street-prayer standoffs have been rare; recent police logs list only a few dozen infractions nationwide in 2024.\n\n**Verdict:** The practice still happens in isolated cases, but most \u201cevidence\u201d circulating now is recycled footage meant to imply a current, systematic takeover.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Animal-abuse clips pinned on Muslim migrants\n\n* **No mainstream outlet or animal-welfare NGO has documented a migrant-linked dog-abuse trend.**  \n* High-engagement posts about \u201cimmigrants eating pets\u201d were debunked multiple times in 2024:  \n  * A satirical fake *Atlantic* headline about migrants eating cats \ue200cite\ue202turn9news3\ue201.  \n  * Trump\u2019s claim that Haitian newcomers were stealing pets for food, mocked by Germany\u2019s foreign ministry \ue200cite\ue202turn9news4\ue201.  \n  * An \u201cXL Bully dog scares Muslims\u201d TikTok video proved to be staged and re-edited \ue200cite\ue202turn9news2\ue201.\n\n**Verdict:** So far every viral abuse clip tied to \u201cMuslim immigrants\u201d in Europe/North America has collapsed under fact-checking.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Migrant crime and home break-ins\n\n* Germany\u2019s Ifo Institute (using 2018-23 police data) found **no statistical link between the share of foreigners in a district and overall crime rates**\u2014spikes tend to coincide with urban pockets where both natives and newcomers face high unemployment \ue200cite\ue202turn10news10\ue201.  \n* Right-wing social media frequently recycles choreographed or unrelated violence clips. Example: a stunt-school fight video repackaged as a migrant assault gained 1.4 million X views before Reuters debunked it \ue200cite\ue202turn11news9\ue201.\n\n**Verdict:** Genuine migrant-linked crimes occur (young males are over-represented in certain offences everywhere), but the *scale* portrayed online is inflated by miscaptioned videos.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  \u201cMuslims heckling women for immodest dress\u201d\n\nNo major European police force or watchdog has logged a wave of such incidents in 2024-25.  Most clips claiming to show moral-policing mobs stem from:\n\n* Old French street-prayer protests (see \u00a73).  \n* Mislabelled brawls or staged content (again, the underpass stunt video \ue200cite\ue202turn11news9\ue201).  \n\n---\n\n## 7.

The violence in Gaza, sparked by a deadly Hamas attack in October 2023, intensified bias and demonstrations in the U.S. with calls to end U.S. support for Israel. Campus protests led to canceled classes, administrative resignations, and student arrests. Notable hate crimes included fatal and non-fatal attacks on Palestinian Americans. The U.S. government's recent arrest of a prominent pro-Palestinian protestor has also drawn criticism from rights advocates.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":16,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"reuters.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":6190,"end_idx":6207,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_pro-Palestinian_protests_on_university_campuses"],"refs":[],"alt":"([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_pro-Palestinian_protests_on_university_campuses))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_pro-Palestinian_protests_on_university_campuses","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn14news9\ue201","start_idx":6386,"end_idx":6404,"safe_urls":["https://nypost.com/2025/06/04/us-news/doe-says-columbia-should-be-stripped-of-accreditation-over-indifference-to-antisemitism-on-campus/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/06/04/us-news/doe-says-columbia-should-be-stripped-of-accreditation-over-indifference-to-antisemitism-on-campus/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"DOE says Columbia should be stripped of accreditation over 'indifference' to antisemitism on campus","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/04/us-news/doe-says-columbia-should-be-stripped-of-accreditation-over-indifference-to-antisemitism-on-campus/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749070050.0,"snippet":"The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) has recommended that Columbia University be stripped of its accreditation due to what it describes as \"deliberate indifference\" to antisemitic harassment of Jewish students. In a letter to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), the DOE\u2019s Office of Civil Rights accused Columbia of failing to protect Jewish students, especially following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. The campus saw a surge of anti-Israel protests, including encampments and illegal building occupations, which the DOE claims deprived Jewish students of equal access to education, violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The Department of Justice also revealed that protester Tarek Bazrouk, indicted on hate crime charges, had ties to Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades. Columbia has pledged to comply with various reforms, including banning identity-concealing face coverings, in coordination with federal agencies. The MSCHE has acknowledged receipt of the DOE\u2019s findings but declined to comment. Prominent alumni and officials have supported the DOE's actions, emphasizing the necessity for systemic change to ensure campus safety and inclusivity.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"nypost.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6search8\ue201","start_idx":6525,"end_idx":6544,"safe_urls":["https://annielab.org/2023/11/16/out-of-context-video-showing-muslim-street-prayers-in-france-is-six-years-old/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([annielab.org](https://annielab.org/2023/11/16/out-of-context-video-showing-muslim-street-prayers-in-france-is-six-years-old/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Out of context: Video showing Muslim street prayers in France is six ...","url":"https://annielab.org/2023/11/16/out-of-context-video-showing-muslim-street-prayers-in-france-is-six-years-old/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1700092800.0,"snippet":"The video was taken in March 2017 while a group of Muslims protested against the closure of a prayer hall in Clichy, a suburban area in Paris.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"annielab.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn9news3\ue202turn9news2\ue201","start_idx":6648,"end_idx":6676,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/edited-xl-bully-reaction-clip-misrepresented-targeting-muslim-refugees-2024-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/fake-atlantic-headline-migrants-stems-satirical-account-2024-09-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/fake-atlantic-headline-migrants-stems-satirical-account-2024-09-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/edited-xl-bully-reaction-clip-misrepresented-targeting-muslim-refugees-2024-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Fake Atlantic headline on migrants stems from a satirical account","url":"https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/fake-atlantic-headline-migrants-stems-satirical-account-2024-09-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1727448375.0,"snippet":"A fake screenshot circulating on social media falsely claims that The Atlantic published an article titled \"Why Migrants Eating Cats Might Be a Good Thing.\" This fabricated headline is followed by a subheading alleging that conservatives do not understand the cultural significance of traditional Haitian cuisine.

Anna Bross, senior vice president of communications at The Atlantic, confirmed the images are fake and advised checking their website to verify articles. The fake headline originated from a satirical account on the platform X, which clearly states its content is parody.
