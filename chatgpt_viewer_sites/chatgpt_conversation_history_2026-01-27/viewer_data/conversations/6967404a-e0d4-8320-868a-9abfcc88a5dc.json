\u2014 in fact the differences go to \\(0\\) **much faster** than a geometric rate.\n\nLet\n\\[\nf(x)=\\frac{x^2+4}{2(x-1)},\\qquad x_{n+1}=f(x_n),\\quad x_1=4.\n\\]\nThe fixed points satisfy \\(x=f(x)\\iff x^2-2x-4=0\\), hence\n\\[\nr:=1+\\sqrt5,\\qquad s:=1-\\sqrt5\n\\]\nare the two fixed points.\n\n## 1) Two exact identities (key)\nUsing \\(r^2-2r-4=0\\) (and similarly for \\(s\\)),

x_n+r^2}{2(x_n-1)}\n=\\frac{(x_n-r)^2}{2(x_n-1)}.\n\\]\nLikewise,\n\\[\nx_{n+1}-s=\\frac{(x_n-s)^2}{2(x_n-1)}.\n\\]\nTherefore, for the ratio\n\\[\nt_n:=\\frac{x_n-r}{x_n-s},\n\\]\nwe get the *exact* squaring law\n\\[\nt_{n+1}=\\left(\\frac{x_{n+1}-r}{x_{n+1}-s}\\right)\n=\\left(\\frac{x_n-r}{x_n-s}\\right)^2\n=t_n^2.\n\\]\nNow\n\\[\nt_1=\\frac{4-r}{4-s}=\\frac{3-\\sqrt5}{3+\\sqrt5}\\in(0,1),\n\\]\nso\n\\[\nt_n=t_1^{\\,2^{\\,n-1}}\\quad\\text{(double-exponential

\\(x_n-r\\):\n\\[\nx_n-r=\\frac{(r-s)t_n}{1-t_n}=\\frac{2\\sqrt5\\,t_n}{1-t_n}.\n\\]\nSince \\(t_n\\to 0\\), for all sufficiently large \\(n\\) we have \\(t_n\\le \\tfrac12\\), hence\n\\[\n0<x_n-r\\le 4\\sqrt5\\,t_n = 4\\sqrt5\\,t_1^{2^{n-1}}.\n\\]\nAlso \\(x_n\\searrow r\\) (indeed \\(x_{n+1}-r=\\frac{(x_n-r)^2}{2(x_n-1)}>0\\) and \\(x_{n+1}<x_n\\) when \\(x_n>r\\)), so\n\\[\n|x_{n+1}-x_n|=x_n-x_{n+1}=(x_n-r)-(x_{n+1}-r) < x_n-r.\n\\]\nThus for all sufficiently large \\(n\\),\n\\[\n|x_{n+1}-x_n| < 4\\sqrt5\\,t_1^{2^{n-1}}.\n\\]\n\n## 3) Compare to \\(c^n\\)\nPick

Concretely, for \\(c=\\tfrac12\\) the inequality\n\\[\n4\\sqrt5\\,t_1^{2^{n-1}} < \\left(\\frac12\\right)^n\n\\]\nis equivalent (taking logs) to\n\\[\n2^{n-1}|\\ln t_1| > n\\ln 2 + \\ln(4\\sqrt5),\n\\]\nand the left-hand side grows like \\(2^n\\) while the right-hand side grows like \\(n\\), so it holds for all sufficiently large \\(n\\).\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, such a
