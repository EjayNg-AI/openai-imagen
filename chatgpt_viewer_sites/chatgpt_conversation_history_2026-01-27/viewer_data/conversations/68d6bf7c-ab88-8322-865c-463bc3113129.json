(not literally)\r\n\r\nHere's how it plays out:\r\n\r\nStep 1: The nation doubles down on AI and robotics full tilt. This is ostensibly a good thing. Businesses, government, and the whole economy orient towards this. Military, all of it. Just as we're seeing. Acceleration is the default policy. So far, so good. \r\n\r\nStep 2: This is where it gets dicey. As automation takes more and more jobs, we get hit with a quadruple crisis:\r\n\r\n>> Household income craters (citizens unhappy)\r\n>> Consumer demand plummets (businesses unhappy)\r\n>> Tax base dries up (governments unhappy)\r\n>> Credit crunch from hell (banks unhappy)\r\n\r\nThis isn't just a lose-lose scenario, it's a lose-lose-lose-lose scenario that could lead directly to technofeudalism. \r\n\r\nWhy? Because that much catastrophe could lead to a complete deconstruction of the current status quo, and pivot to a more \"managed capitalism\" via privatization, elite captures, and that rentier economy where \"you will own nothing and be happy\"\r\n\r\nStep 3: That's the capture phase that happens after the credit crunch from hell and debt crisis. If we fail to prepare for that, it will be the most painful Great Depression the world has ever seen, and not because productivity is low, but because allocation has fundamentally broken. \r\n\r\nStep 4: Technofeudalism that is difficult to escape. Governments in shambles, locked up by debt. Then corporations step in to pick up the pieces. \r\n\r\nBUT\r\n\r\nThere's a path out of this, which right now I think is the default path. The new path would require a national mission to totally refactor capitalism and democracy around this fast-approaching reality. But, the problem with this is that each step must be politically and economically viable.

The U.S. Congress did not pass legislation to align the U.S. with the global tax deal, maintaining a lower 10% minimum corporate tax from Trump's 2017 tax cuts.

Here\u2019s a hard-nosed stress test of each step\u2014and a concrete, politically-viable escape path.\n\n# 1) Is the 4-step \u201ctechnofeudalism\u201d spiral plausible?\n\n**Step 1 (full-tilt AI/robotics):** Absolutely happening. But diffusion is uneven and task-by-task, not a binary replacement. The best empirical frame is the **task-content** view: automation displaces some tasks while new tasks/augmentations reinstate labor elsewhere. Net labor demand moves with the *balance* of displacement vs. reinstatement, not with \u201cAI intensity\u201d per se. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n**Step 2 (quadruple crisis):** This requires three conditions to line up:\n- **Labor share falls faster than new incomes arise** \u2192 aggregate demand weakens because high-income households have lower MPCs than low-income ones. This pattern is well-documented (labor share down; MPCs strongly heterogeneous). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn3search4\ue201  \n- **Automatic stabilizers too weak** \u2192 income shock transmits into a demand slump instead of being cushioned. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search15\ue201  \n- **Private leverage is high** \u2192 deleveraging triggers a **credit crunch** (Minsky-style dynamics; BIS credit-to-GDP gap literature). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search16\ue201  \n\nThese are *contingent*, not fate. Early AI evidence also shows **big productivity gains in augmentation**, especially for lower-skilled workers, which *countervails* Step 2 if we design policy to spread the gains. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n**Steps 3\u20134 (capture \u2192 technofeudalism):** This is the real tail-risk if demand collapses while monopoly/\u201cgatekeeper\u201d power rises and states lose fiscal capacity. The diagnosis is not fringe\u2014see \u201csuperstar firms\u201d and the EU\u2019s DMA enforcement push. Varoufakis\u2019 \u201ctechnofeudalism\u201d is a polemical label, but it points at the same choke points: platform control over access, data, and distribution. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0news87\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n**Bottom line:** David\u2019s spiral is *conditional*. It materializes if (i) distribution tilts hard to capital, (ii) stabilizers lag, and (iii) concentration/finance amplify shocks. None are immutable.\n\n---\n\n# 2) What would actually break the spiral (without \u201cthrowing out capitalism\u201d)?\n\nThink **allocation & stabilization first**, not make-work. A feasible package looks like this:\n\n### A. Keep household demand resilient (automatic, rules-based)\n- **Stronger automatic stabilizers** (bigger EITC/negative-income-tax phase-ins; longer UI durations with automatic triggers). These cushion income shocks and sustain consumption where MPCs are high. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn3search12\ue201\n- **Direct-to-wallet fiscal rails** so support can turn on automatically at macro triggers. Use proven **digital public infrastructure** (the India stack\u2014Aadhaar/UPI/DBT\u2014is a working template). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search16\ue201\n\n### B. Modernize the tax base **without** \u201crobot taxes\u201d\n- **Tax neutrality between labor and capital** (close base-erosion, lean on destination-based VAT with prebates, land value taxes, and enforce corporate minima internationally). \u201cRobot taxes\u201d are clumsy; better to shore up broad-base corporate taxation (OECD Pillar Two where possible) and profit-shifting rules. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0news84\ue201\n\n### C. Capture and socialise *some* AI rents, simply\n- **Sovereign/municipal wealth vehicles** can hold broad market/AI-exposed assets and pay a *dividend* (Alaska PFD/Norway are canonical blueprints\u2014translate to an \u201cAI dividend\u201d funded by general rents, not per-bot levies). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search14\ue201\n\n### D. Contain gatekeeper power ex-ante\n- **Interoperability, portability, fair-dealing rules and structural remedies** for gatekeepers (DMA-style). Tie public procurement and subsidies to **open APIs, non-discriminatory access to models/compute/data**, and auditability. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news87\ue201\n\n### E. Macro-prudential guardrails for the \u201ccredit crunch from hell\u201d\n- Monitor **credit-to-GDP gaps**, debt-service ratios and asset-price leverage; build **counter-cyclical capital buffers** earlier in booms. These are boring but decisive. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search10\ue201\n\n### F. Labor market transition\u2014aim for *up-skilling + augmentation*, not job guarantees\n- **Lifelong learning accounts**, portable benefits, and employer cost-sharing for redeployments in automating firms.

But the \u201cdefault path out\u201d is real and implementable **now** with boring but potent tools: automatic stabilizers on modern rails, neutral tax bases that actually collect, early macro-prudential tightening, and gatekeeper rules that keep markets open.

In China, physical gold demand weakened, with local dealers offering steep discounts of $31\u2013$71 per ounce compared to global prices\u2014the widest in years. This decline is attributed to investor interest in Chinese equities, especially the CSI300 Index, which has shown gains. Despite the slump, trading volumes remain high on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.\n\nConversely, demand in India stayed strong, with premiums holding at up to $7 per ounce\u2014highest since November 2024\u2014as investors increasingly bought coins and bars despite record-high prices. The surge is driven by expectations of continued gold price increases and ahead of traditional festivals like Dussehra and Diwali.\n\nIn other key Asian markets, including Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan, moderate premiums persisted ($1.50\u2013$2.50), indicating steady demand. Analysts expect the gold-buying trend to continue, particularly if prices dip, as physical gold remains a preferred investment for many in the region.

U.S. gold futures for December delivery also remained steady at $3,774.50. Despite the subdued trading, spot gold has gained 1.6% for the week. The improved sentiment stems from stronger-than-expected U.S. economic indicators\u2014particularly declining jobless claims and robust Q2 GDP growth\u2014leading investors to lower the probability of Fed rate cuts in October and December.\n\nMeanwhile, new tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, set to take effect on October 1, bolstered gold\u2019s appeal as a safe-haven asset. Market focus is now on the upcoming U.S. core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, expected to rise 0.3% monthly and 2.7% annually in August.\n\nElsewhere in the precious metals market, silver declined nearly 1% to $44.83 per ounce, while platinum rose 0.8% to $1,541.39, nearing a 12-year high, and palladium increased 0.9% to $1,261.59.

Here's Why Experts See It Rising Even Higher","snippet":"Gold prices have reached an all-time high of approximately $3,780 per ounce, and experts forecast continued growth, potentially exceeding $4,000 by the end of 2025. This surge is driven by a combination of global economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, central bank purchases, a weakening U.S. dollar, and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. The real inflation-adjusted gold price also broke records for the first time since 1980.\n\nCentral banks are heavily increasing their gold reserves due to its role as a geopolitical hedge and a means of diversification, as many expect a decline in the U.S. dollar's prominence in global reserves. The dollar has fallen over 10% this year, influenced by trade tensions, recession fears, and a loss of confidence in U.S. economic policy, partially attributed to Trump-era policies.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve's moves to cut interest rates and potential political interference in its operations are enhancing gold's appeal. Investment managers, like Jeffrey Gundlach, now advocate for significant portfolio allocation to gold, anticipating strong future performance amid ongoing financial instability and declining trust in the U.S. dollar.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758575536.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gold.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-demand-trends/gold-demand-trends-q1-2025/central-banks","title":"Central Banks - Gold Demand Trends: Q1 2025","snippet":"Apr 30, 2025 \u2014 Central bank demand presented here comprises aggregate reported changes as well as an estimate for unreported buying.

These measures may include controlling interest rates, regulating capital movements, direct lending to the government, and tighter regulations on financial institutions. Consequently, savers often earn returns below inflation, leading to reduced purchasing power. The term was introduced by Stanford economists Edward S. Shaw and Ronald I. McKinnon in 1973 to criticize policies impeding economic growth in emerging markets. Such repression can undermine economic growth and innovation by diverting funds from private investments, potentially leading to capital flight. Recent implementations, like post-2008 financial crisis policies, have aimed to reduce public debt but can hinder economic efficiency and damage savers' interests.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1311267600.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68d6c106a934832cb079d994599258f3","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching historical examples of financial repression and debt reduction","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98542d307affa3d0-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"6bd0bb5f-2533-49e8-a2d0-0837d76ad3b1","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6bd0bb5f-2533-49e8-a2d0-0837d76ad3b1","children":["e53ea954-3094-45d6-8fd0-f2f4a4ca7217"]},"e53ea954-3094-45d6-8fd0-f2f4a4ca7217":{"id":"e53ea954-3094-45d6-8fd0-f2f4a4ca7217","message":{"id":"e53ea954-3094-45d6-8fd0-f2f4a4ca7217","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758904623.454382,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Structuring the gold argument","content":"I want to address the user's instinct that \"most paths are good for gold.\" \n\nHere\u2019s a quick summary: \"You're partially right\u2014many paths support gold, but not all.

Enacted under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it prohibited banks, financial institutions, and the Federal Reserve from exchanging U.S. dollars for gold. This act followed other emergency measures during the 1933 banking crisis, such as the Emergency Banking Act and the Glass-Steagall Act. Roosevelt's Executive Order 6102 required the public to exchange their gold for U.S. dollars, leading to the suspension of the gold standard. The Gold Reserve Act fixed the dollar's weight in gold and increased its nominal price, thus increasing the Treasury's gold value. Although it resulted in several Supreme Court cases challenging its constitutionality based on the Fifth Amendment, the court ultimately ruled in favor of the government's authority over the money supply and compensation terms. The price of gold remained fixed until President Nixon ended the gold convertibility of the dollar in 1971, creating a fiat currency system.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1205168400.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68d6c106a934832cb079d994599258f3","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Formulating arguments and scenarios for gold outlook","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98542d307affa3d0-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"b4a88140-c4dc-475f-be12-d036756498a5","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b4a88140-c4dc-475f-be12-d036756498a5","children":["af5cdb15-8edb-40ed-951c-7d79ea51adca"]},"af5cdb15-8edb-40ed-951c-7d79ea51adca":{"id":"af5cdb15-8edb-40ed-951c-7d79ea51adca","message":{"id":"af5cdb15-8edb-40ed-951c-7d79ea51adca","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758904632.167841,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"World Gold Council strategic case for gold portfolio allocation 2-10%\"}, {\"q\": \"How much gold in a portfolio WGC portfolio analysis 2023 2024\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"World Gold Council strategic case for gold portfolio allocation 2-10%"},{"type":"search","q":"How much gold in a portfolio WGC portfolio analysis 2023 2024"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching gold portfolio allocation guidance from WGC","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98542d307affa3d0-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"ea878fa0-482a-4062-b0e6-b47578e9e425","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"ea878fa0-482a-4062-b0e6-b47578e9e425","children":["4f7ce963-2fdd-47fa-81ef-478c4259ce30"]},"4f7ce963-2fdd-47fa-81ef-478c4259ce30":{"id":"4f7ce963-2fdd-47fa-81ef-478c4259ce30","message":{"id":"4f7ce963-2fdd-47fa-81ef-478c4259ce30","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1758904639.096518,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_model_queries":{"type":"search_model_queries","queries":["World Gold Council strategic case for gold portfolio allocation 2-10%","How much gold in a portfolio WGC portfolio analysis 2023 2024"]},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching gold portfolio allocation guidance from WGC","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98542d307affa3d0-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"af5cdb15-8edb-40ed-951c-7d79ea51adca","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"af5cdb15-8edb-40ed-951c-7d79ea51adca","children":["a5c5c820-f38e-4c8e-a3d2-65759402462e"]},"a5c5c820-f38e-4c8e-a3d2-65759402462e":{"id":"a5c5c820-f38e-4c8e-a3d2-65759402462e","message":{"id":"a5c5c820-f38e-4c8e-a3d2-65759402462e","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1758904639.076437,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gold.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/relevance-of-gold-as-a-strategic-asset","title":"Gold as a strategic asset: 2025 edition","snippet":"Jan 23, 2025 \u2014 Gold has a key role as a strategic long-term investment and as a mainstay allocation in a well-diversified portfolio.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1737619200.0,"attribution":"www.gold.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/portfolio-continuum-rethinking-gold-alternatives-investing","title":"The Portfolio Continuum: Rethinking Gold in Alternatives ...","snippet":"Jul 24, 2025 \u2014 Building on our previous research, this paper explores how gold can serve as a complementary asset within alternative allocations.

The inflow of $38 billion marked a significant rebound following a period of outflows between 2021 and 2023 due to high interest rates, and a modest net inflow in 2024. The resurgence is attributed to heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty caused by a trade war linked to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, driving investors toward gold as a safe haven. Global gold ETF holdings increased by 397.1 metric tons, bringing total holdings to 3,615.9 tons by June's end\u2014the highest since August 2022. U.S.-listed funds led with 206.8 tons added, while Asia-listed ETFs followed with 104.3 tons.

Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters anticipate a reduction in their dollar-denominated reserves, an increase from 62% in the previous year. This shift comes amid a backdrop of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, contributing to gold\u2019s appeal as a safe haven, inflation hedge, and portfolio diversifier. Gold prices have surged, reaching a record $3,500.05 per ounce in April 2025\u2014up 95% since the Ukraine conflict began in early 2022. Central banks have consistently purchased over 1,000 metric tons of gold annually for the past three years, a notable rise from the earlier average of 400-500 tons.

This rally is primarily driven by heavy central bank purchases and increased investment demand, particularly through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Central banks, especially from developing countries, are buying gold to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar after sanctions froze part of Russia's reserves. Annual central bank gold purchases have topped 1,000 metric tons since 2022, making up 23% of total demand \u2014 double the average from the 2010s.\n\nMeanwhile, jewellery demand has declined sharply due to high prices, with a 14% drop in the second quarter of 2025 led by decreases in China and India. Gold jewellery fabrication is projected to fall 16% in 2025. In the retail investment market, demand for gold bars rose 10% in 2024, while coin purchases dropped 31%. Investment in gold ETFs is seeing a resurgence, with the largest first-half inflow since 2020, totaling 397 tons.

The drop was largely attributed to significant fluctuations in gold exports influenced by fears surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's inconsistent tariff policy. Early in the year, bullion exports surged as investors in the U.S. hedged against potential gold import tariffs. However, in April, gold was excluded from the tariffs, reversing export flows and contributing to increased import expenses.\n\nData from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) revealed that while Switzerland earned 28.2 billion francs from gold exports, it faced 38 billion francs in expenses, resulting in a 9.7 billion franc trade deficit in gold. Despite monthly volatility, total gold exports remained steady into Q3. Analysts, including UBS economist Maxime Botteron, view the surplus contraction as temporary and not alarming, expecting stabilization going forward.

This surge is driven by a combination of global economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, central bank purchases, a weakening U.S. dollar, and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. The real inflation-adjusted gold price also broke records for the first time since 1980.\n\nCentral banks are heavily increasing their gold reserves due to its role as a geopolitical hedge and a means of diversification, as many expect a decline in the U.S. dollar's prominence in global reserves. The dollar has fallen over 10% this year, influenced by trade tensions, recession fears, and a loss of confidence in U.S. economic policy, partially attributed to Trump-era policies.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve's moves to cut interest rates and potential political interference in its operations are enhancing gold's appeal. Investment managers, like Jeffrey Gundlach, now advocate for significant portfolio allocation to gold, anticipating strong future performance amid ongoing financial instability and declining trust in the U.S. dollar.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758575536.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"fred.stlouisfed.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10","title":"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant ...","snippet":"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis, Inflation-Indexed (DFII10) ; 2025-09-24: 1.78 ; 2025-09-23: ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=2wv","title":"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant ...","snippet":"Graph and download economic data for Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis-Market Yield on ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=TzTj","title":"10-Year Real Interest Rate | FRED | St. Louis Fed","snippet":"For further information regarding treasury constant maturity data, please refer to the H.15 Statistical Release notes and the Treasury Yield Curve Methodology.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=DFII10%2CDFII5%2CDFII20%2CDFII30%2C","title":"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year ... - FRED","snippet":"Graph and download economic data for Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis, Inflation-Indexed ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10","title":"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant ...","snippet":"View a 10-year yield estimated from the average yields of a variety of Treasury securities with different maturities derived from the Treasury yield curve.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=dHwR","title":"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant ...","snippet":"The breakeven inflation rate represents a measure of expected inflation derived from 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Securities.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gold.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-etfs-holdings-and-flows","title":"Gold ETF: Stock, Holdings and Flows","snippet":"4 days ago \u2014 Flows and holdings data are updated on the website weekly and monthly.

The corporate tax rate is a flat 17%, but effective rates can be lower due to various incentives, particularly for startups which can receive tax exemptions up to S$125,000 on the first S$200,000 of income during their first three years. Capital gains are generally not taxed, and the top marginal personal income tax rate is 24% for income above S$1 million starting from 2024, up from 22% for income over S$320,000 prior to that.\n\nAdditionally, certain industries like foreign banking and offshore funds benefit from specific tax exemptions. Despite offering financial privacy, Singapore enforces due diligence measures to combat money laundering and may cooperate with foreign authorities in criminal investigations. The Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates the financial sector. Singapore maintains a stable, high-income economy with strong infrastructure and human capital development. Investors can access Singapore\u2019s markets through direct stock purchases, ADRs, ETFs, or mutual funds. Overall, its favorable tax policies and financial regulations position Singapore as a key global hub and effective tax haven.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1465322400.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68d6c106a934832cb079d994599258f3","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Verifying Singapore capital gains tax regulations","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98542d307affa3d0-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"f3877c15-ec1a-4327-b6ae-e9ae052ff623","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f3877c15-ec1a-4327-b6ae-e9ae052ff623","children":["91aca035-55c1-4471-97c8-0cd97d20afb0"]},"91aca035-55c1-4471-97c8-0cd97d20afb0":{"id":"91aca035-55c1-4471-97c8-0cd97d20afb0","message":{"id":"91aca035-55c1-4471-97c8-0cd97d20afb0","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758904700.224125,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for 2m 30s"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":150,"request_id":"98542d307affa3d0-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"8d28ee63-906e-4f57-8bee-aca2a78d10e2","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8d28ee63-906e-4f57-8bee-aca2a78d10e2","children":["d3d3d2a0-5654-4cab-b383-190694fe088a"]},"d3d3d2a0-5654-4cab-b383-190694fe088a":{"id":"d3d3d2a0-5654-4cab-b383-190694fe088a","message":{"id":"d3d3d2a0-5654-4cab-b383-190694fe088a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758904679.042398,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Your instincts aren\u2019t crazy\u2014but \u201calmost all paths are good for gold\u201d is too strong.

Of the 73 central banks surveyed between February 25 and May 20, 2025, 76% expect their gold holdings to rise over the next five years, up from 69% last year. Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters anticipate a reduction in their dollar-denominated reserves, an increase from 62% in the previous year. This shift comes amid a backdrop of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, contributing to gold\u2019s appeal as a safe haven, inflation hedge, and portfolio diversifier. Gold prices have surged, reaching a record $3,500.05 per ounce in April 2025\u2014up 95% since the Ukraine conflict began in early 2022. Central banks have consistently purchased over 1,000 metric tons of gold annually for the past three years, a notable rise from the earlier average of 400-500 tons. The survey also indicates that 95% of respondents foresee a growth in global central bank gold reserves over the next year, with the Bank of England being the preferred storage location. Trade tensions and tariffs, particularly in emerging and developing economies, were also key factors influencing reserve management strategies.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201","start_idx":2465,"end_idx":2484,"safe_urls":["https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/nam/en/insights/markets-and-investing/is-it-a-golden-era-for-gold?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([J.P.

though warning signs are emerging. The S&P 500 (SPX) is still in an uptrend with key support levels at 6,550, 6,500, 6,340\u20136,360, and 6,200. However, a recent decline triggered a new McMillan Volatility Band (MVB) sell signal \u2014 the fourth since June, with the previous three resulting in losses. Despite robust technical indicators like a low VIX and continued strength in cumulative volume breadth, market breadth has been weakening. Both equity-only put-call ratios and breadth oscillators have turned over, signaling possible short-term pullbacks.\n\nVolatility remains low but slightly up, with VIX not yet entering \u201cspiking\u201d mode. The structure of volatility derivatives still supports bullish conditions. The report advises some cautious hedging moves, including put spreads and breadth-oscillator-based trades, while suggesting profit-taking via rolling in-the-money options. A range of open options positions are discussed, with instructions to adjust or hold them based on market movements or technical indicators. Overall, while the long-term market trend remains bullish, short-term caution is warranted due to emerging bearish signals.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758829740.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"m.economictimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/enjoy-the-calm-now-goldman-sachs-says-market-volatility-may-return-in-october/articleshow/124160099.cms","title":"Enjoy the calm now - Goldman Sachs says market volatility may return in October","snippet":"In September 2025, U.S. stock markets experienced their strongest performance in 15 years, with the S&P 500, as tracked by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), gaining 3.6% \u2014 the best September since 2010.

The S&P 500 has already risen 13% this year, setting new records after a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, with expectations of further cuts potentially fueling more gains. Spitznagel believes the index could surpass 8,000 points before crashing by as much as 80% due to economic fragility and high borrowing costs.\n\nUniversa, a $20 billion Miami-based fund, uses derivatives like stock options and credit default swaps to profit from extreme market downturns. Known for its bearish positioning, the fund has earned impressive long-term returns, including major gains during the 2020 pandemic market turmoil. While bullish in the short term, Spitznagel warns that the market is currently in a euphoric phase driven by lingering effects of ultra-loose monetary policy since 2008.

Two problems: (i) 2020\u2019s pattern (-34% in ~1 month, immediate V-rebound) is not the base case; (ii) the initial phase of a dash-for-cash often hits **everything** (including gold) before policy backstops arrive. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\nBelow is a compact, rules-driven playbook that preserves your skepticism without turning it into open-ended opportunity cost.\n\n# A. Park cash intelligently (SG context)\n- **Short bills / SSB ladder** while you wait, then roll into risk as triggers fire. The latest **6-month T-bill** cut-off was ~**1.38\u20131.44%**, and current **SSB** 10-year averages sit under ~2%\u2014low carry, but non-trivial versus zero. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n- Keep a **USD sleeve** if your shopping list is USD assets; in panics the USD can squeeze higher even as risk sells off. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n# B. Replace \u201cone big buy\u201d with **tranches + signals**\n1) **Drawdown tranches (price-based):** pre-commit amounts at index drawdowns (example)  \n  \u2022 \u201315%: deploy 20% of your cash sleeve  \n  \u2022 \u201325%: +30%  \n  \u2022 \u201335%: +30%  \n  \u2022 \u201345%: +20%  \nThis removes guessing and forces you to scale *into* pain.\n\n2) **Stress overlays (flow/vol-based):** only fire the *next* tranche when at least **one** of these is true:  \n  \u2022 **VIX \u2265 35\u201340** (panic zone),  \n  \u2022 **US HY OAS \u2265 ~700 bps**,  \n  \u2022 **Bid\u2013ask / FRA-OIS** shows funding stress.  \nThese are the same plumbing cracks that defined March 2020. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n3) **Time backstop:** if neither price nor stress triggers hit within **N months** (pick 6\u201312), deploy a time-based tranche anyway. This caps the \u201cforever waiting\u201d risk. Evidence on \u201cmissing the best days\u201d is mixed, but the *broad* point stands: staying out indefinitely is expensive when rebounds cluster. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n# C. Gold: treat as a **rebalance hedge**, not a one-way bet\n- Keep a target band (say **8\u201315%** of liquid net worth) and rebalance **both ways**. Note that during the **initial** COVID dash-for-cash, gold **dipped** with risk before ripping once policy landed; don\u2019t be shocked if it happens again. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n- Watch **central-bank demand** and **USD**: both have dominated gold\u2019s tape recently even with positive real rates. If those flows stall, expect more variance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n# D. If you want to be paid while you wait\n- **Cash-secured put ladder** on broad indices or quality names you\u2019d love to own at your tranche levels. You either collect premium or get your desired entry price (with gap-risk caveats in crashes). This is a *rules* substitute for discretionary buys; it enforces discipline.\n\n# E. A minimal **always-on core**\nHold a **small, permanent equity core** (even 10\u201320% of your intended equity risk). Why: the early phase of recoveries is violent and policy-driven; entirely waiting in cash tends to miss a big chunk of the right tail. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n# F. Your dashboard (flip these to \u201cTrue\u201d to start deploying faster)\n- **Price:** S&P/Nasdaq down \u2265 20\u201330% from highs (your tranche map).  \n- **Vol:** **VIX \u2265 35\u201340** (panic), term structure inverted. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- **Credit:** **HY OAS \u2265 ~700 bps** (stress spilling into funding). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n- **Plumbing:** FRA-OIS or bid-ask in USTs widening (funding/liquidity strain). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- **Policy:** emergency facilities / coordinated cuts\u2014historically the point when buying *into* weakness has the best expectancy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n# G. What would *falsify* the \u201csit in cash\u201d thesis?\n- **Orderly disinflation + productivity boom** (real yields up, volatility subdued): equities grind higher without the air-pocket you\u2019re waiting for; gold underperforms; VIX anchored in the mid-teens (roughly where it is now). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\nKeep the powder\u2014but **put it on a timer and a trigger**, not on vibes. Ladder your entries by drawdown, confirm with stress signals, keep a small always-on core, get paid with cash-secured puts if you can, and treat gold as a rebalance hedge.

This comes as the fund, managing an estimated $936 billion and ranked as the seventh-largest globally by Global SWF, also reduced transparency in its annual report. GIC has scaled back disclosures on asset class distribution and geographic allocations, making it harder to assess its risk exposure, particularly in regions like China and developed market equities. The fund now reports more generalized regional groupings and does not individually detail holdings in areas like the euro zone or UK.\n\nGIC increased its equity allocation to 51% while reducing fixed income to 26%. Despite boosting U.S. equity investments, the fund\u2019s cautious stance amid high valuations held back potential gains. The shift toward opacity coincides with public demands in Singapore for greater fund transparency, especially from the opposition Workers\u2019 Party.

This growth was driven by the strong performance of listed Singapore firms and direct investments in China, India, and the U.S. Temasek noted that major U.S. economic risks\u2014such as immigration policy changes, tariffs, and fiscal tightening\u2014have likely peaked. Although cautious about ongoing trade developments initiated by U.S. President Donald Trump, the company sees signs of economic recovery due to Federal Reserve rate cuts and regulatory easing.\n\nThe U.S. remains Temasek's largest investment destination outside Singapore, comprising 24% of its portfolio, up from 22% the previous year. China is the third-largest market with 18% exposure, where Temasek identifies opportunities in green technology, life sciences, and strong domestic brands. Looking ahead, the fund plans to emphasize investments with stable cash flows, large domestic market access, and resilience to geopolitical risks, particularly in infrastructure and AI. Temasek has invested in AI-focused firms like Nvidia, Databricks, and Veeam and recently joined a Microsoft- and BlackRock-backed consortium to expand AI infrastructure.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752044639.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68d6c6459a288332b27c047fe1ae3dc7","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Evaluating Singapore's AI Strategy and Sovereign Wealth Funds","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98544e1fa9f0a3d0-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"31e752ff-db97-4053-8b59-fe963deb4def","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"31e752ff-db97-4053-8b59-fe963deb4def","children":["cc7bca35-ca89-40ba-b33e-a6fc784f9e17"]},"cc7bca35-ca89-40ba-b33e-a6fc784f9e17":{"id":"cc7bca35-ca89-40ba-b33e-a6fc784f9e17","message":{"id":"cc7bca35-ca89-40ba-b33e-a6fc784f9e17","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758905930.037848,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into NIRC details","content":"I need to gather some info on how much of Singapore\u2019s budget comes from the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC).

Here\u2019s a clean, critical take.\n\n# Why Singapore starts ahead\n**1) Fiscal firepower that turns productivity into broad demand.**  \nRoughly **~20%+ of annual spending** is funded\u2014systematically\u2014by investment returns on past savings (**NIRC**), which lets the state stabilize demand without heavy new taxes or debt. The mechanism is constitutional and smoothed over long horizons, not ad-hoc. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search10\ue201\n\n**2) Two-cap SWF model with credible long-run returns.**  \nGIC\u2019s rolling 20-year **real** return is **3.8%**; Temasek\u2019s net portfolio value reached **S$434bn** in FY2025. This supports the NIRC and buffer capacity, even if returns vary cycle-to-cycle. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search14\ue201\n\n**3) \u201cPragmatic AI\u201d posture with concrete plumbing.**  \n- **National AI Strategy 2.0 (Dec 2023)** spells out compute, talent and adoption goals (incl. plans to **scale compute** and grow talent to ~15k). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- **AI governance that\u2019s usable:** **AI Verify** and the **Model AI Governance Framework for GenAI (2024)** give standardised safety/eval practices instead of blanket bans. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- **Digital public infrastructure** (Singpass, **MyInfo**, **SGFinDex**) already exists\u2014rails you can use for targeted, rules-based support if allocation breaks. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search7\ue201\n\n**4) Compute & data-centre realism.**  \nThe **DC moratorium** was lifted with sustainability constraints; the **Green Data Centre Roadmap (2024)** and new capacity awards make room for AI while managing power/carbon. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search9\ue202turn2search3\ue201\n\n**5) Adoption over hype:** IMDA is subsidising SME GenAI take-up and just expanded programmes to bring **2,000** firms onto AI, plus an \u201cAI-fluent workforce\u201d push. That tilts tech from concentration \u2192 diffusion. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search20\ue202turn2search11\ue201\n\n# Where the thesis can fail (watch these)\n**A. Returns & transparency risk.**  \nIf long-horizon SWF returns compress\u2014or if perceived opacity rises\u2014political latitude to use NIRC narrows. Note the (modest) scrutiny of GIC\u2019s disclosure this year. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news50\ue201\n\n**B. Compute dependence & scale.**  \nSingapore is a price-taker on advanced chips and hyperscale clouds; power/land caps remain binding even with the green roadmap. That\u2019s a chokepoint big platforms can exploit. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search12\ue201\n\n**C. Gatekeeper power.**  \nCompetition tools exist (CCCS guidance, merger rules) but SG hasn\u2019t enacted an EU-style DMA. Without strong **interoperability/portability** in practice (PDPC\u2019s data-portability duty is **not yet in force**), switching costs can recreate platform tolls. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\n**D. Small open economy exposure.**  \nExternal shocks (USD financial conditions, energy) can transmit quickly; that argues for pre-committed, automatic stabilisers riding your DPI rails.\n\n# Anti-feudal playbook (Singapore-specific, feasible now)\n1) **Compute commons, not just subsidies.**  \nScale a **national, neutral compute pool** with **fair-access rules** (queueing, published prices, SME quotas). Tie **cloud credits** (e.g., the **Enterprise Compute Initiative**) to **data/export interoperability** and non-discriminatory access. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search14\ue201  \n2) **Turn data portability \u201con.\u201d**  \nBring the **Data Portability** obligation into force with technical standards (APIs, schemas) and enforcement. This is your low-drama antidote to gatekeeper lock-in. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201  \n3) **Procure for openness.**  \nCondition government AI/compute procurement on: (i) open APIs, (ii) audit logs for access decisions, (iii) model-agnostic interfaces. Use **AI Verify** tests as a baseline for suppliers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n4) **Automatic support on digital rails.**  \nPre-authorise **rules-based transfers** (training stipends, Workfare-style top-ups) that trigger on macro indicators, funded within NIRC. The rails\u2014**Singpass/MyInfo/SGFinDex**\u2014already exist. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \n5) **Credit-cycle brakes.**  \nKeep MAS-style counter-cyclical buffers keyed to credit-to-GDP and debt-service ratios\u2014prevents the \u201ccredit crunch from hell\u201d amplification David worries about.  \n6) **National dividend (small, rules-based).**  \nIf SWF/NIRC outperformance persists, pilot a **modest dividend** (vouchers/cash) as an *automatic stabiliser*, not ideology. Keep it contingent and reversible.\n\n# Simple dashboard (green = resilient, red = drift to feudalism)\n- **NIRC share & SWF 20-yr real returns** (sustained drop \u2192 fiscal room shrinks). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- **Compute access metrics** (GPU-hours available to SMEs/academia; queue times).  \n- **Interoperability in the wild** (number of live data-portability corridors; time-to-switch). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201  \n- **Market power** (CCCS cases/merger remedies in digital). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \n- **AI adoption breadth** (SME programmes hitting targets). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search20\ue201\n\n## Bottom line\nSingapore has **the right levers**\u2014reserves-funded stabilisation (NIRC), credible SWFs, DPI rails, pragmatic AI governance, and a realistic compute plan. That\u2019s a better starting point than the US, which lacks a national DPI and faces more polarised fiscal politics. But you **still** need to harden the weak points: formalise data portability, make compute access neutral, and buy openness with procurement.

This comes as the fund, managing an estimated $936 billion and ranked as the seventh-largest globally by Global SWF, also reduced transparency in its annual report. GIC has scaled back disclosures on asset class distribution and geographic allocations, making it harder to assess its risk exposure, particularly in regions like China and developed market equities. The fund now reports more generalized regional groupings and does not individually detail holdings in areas like the euro zone or UK.\n\nGIC increased its equity allocation to 51% while reducing fixed income to 26%. Despite boosting U.S. equity investments, the fund\u2019s cautious stance amid high valuations held back potential gains. The shift toward opacity coincides with public demands in Singapore for greater fund transparency, especially from the opposition Workers\u2019 Party. With about one-fifth of government spending sourced from investment returns of GIC, Temasek, and the central bank, the lack of detailed performance data undermines confidence in Singapore\u2019s previously lauded fiscal governance and transparency.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search12\ue201","start_idx":2537,"end_idx":2570,"safe_urls":["https://www.imda.gov.sg/resources/press-releases-factsheets-and-speeches/press-releases/2024/sg-announces-green-data-centre-roadmap?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/singapore/management-of-data-centres-in-singapore---an-esg-perspective?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Infocomm Media Development Authority](https://www.imda.gov.sg/resources/press-releases-factsheets-and-speeches/press-releases/2024/sg-announces-green-data-centre-roadmap?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"announces Green Data Centre Roadmap for sustainable ...","url":"https://www.imda.gov.sg/resources/press-releases-factsheets-and-speeches/press-releases/2024/sg-announces-green-data-centre-roadmap?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1717036200.0,"snippet":"May 30, 2024 \u2014 The Green Data Centre (DC) Roadmap to guide digital sustainability and chart green growth pathways for DCs, supporting AI and compute developments.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Management of data centres in Singapore - an ESG ...","url":"https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/singapore/management-of-data-centres-in-singapore---an-esg-perspective?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Dec 16, 2024 \u2014 Following from a moratorium on new data centre projects that was implemented to manage the growth and curtail the energy consumption of the ...","attribution":"Bird & Bird"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":12}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Infocomm Media Development Authority"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search2\ue201","start_idx":2853,"end_idx":2898,"safe_urls":["https://www.cccs.gov.sg/anti-competitive-practices/dominance-and-conduct/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/newsroom/announcements-and-media-releases/cccs-revises-competition-guidelines-for-greater-clarity-and-guidance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/overview-of-pdpa/the-legislation/personal-data-protection-act/data-protection-obligations?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([CCCS](https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/newsroom/announcements-and-media-releases/cccs-revises-competition-guidelines-for-greater-clarity-and-guidance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"CCCS Revises Competition Guidelines for Greater Clarity ...","url":"https://www.cccs.gov.sg/media-and-events/newsroom/announcements-and-media-releases/cccs-revises-competition-guidelines-for-greater-clarity-and-guidance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Dec 31, 2021 \u2014 ... market power and types of potentially abusive conduct in the digital era;. b) The CCCS Guidelines on Substantive Assessment of Mergers were ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Dominance and Conduct","url":"https://www.cccs.gov.sg/anti-competitive-practices/dominance-and-conduct/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"If you are uncertain if your business's trade practice may constitute an abuse of dominance, you can seek guidance or decision from CCCS.
