I\u2019ll structure this by phases, then drill into tech, business cycles, society, and what to watch.\n\n# 1) Four phases (2025\u20132039)\n\n## Phase I \u2014 The Acceleration Peak (2025\u20132027)\n- **AI capex and adoption boom.** Enterprises push copilots/agents into customer support, sales ops, finance ops, software maintenance, research workbenches. ROI is real but uneven; \u201clast-mile reliability\u201d is the bottleneck.\n- **Energy becomes binding.** Datacenter buildouts collide with grid interconnection queues, local politics, and water constraints. With fusion delayed, **gas, nuclear fission, hydro, and big transmission** carry the load; long-duration storage and demand shaping mature.\n- **Benchmarks \u2260 reality.** Repeated \u201cAGI-ish\u201d claims ride benchmark wins. Buyers learn that *secure, verifiable automation in a messy stack* is the prize, not leaderboard scores.\n\n## Phase II \u2014 The Digestif (2028\u20132030)\n- **Reality checks.** Model quality keeps rising, but hallucinations/steerability/data provenance remain stubborn. Procurement tightens: CFOs require auditable reliability and clear unit-economics (cost per verified task, not cost per token).\n- **Consolidation.** Many AI startups and some fusion ventures fail or sell; hyperscalers, chipmakers, and a handful of vertically focused platforms gain share. Open-weight ecosystems narrow the gap with frontier labs for many workloads.\n- **\u201cCompute sobriety.\u201d** Investors re-rate from \u201cinfinite scaling\u201d to **efficiency and verification**. Multiples compress even as operational usage grows.\n\n## Phase III \u2014 Verified Autonomy in Narrow Domains (2031\u20132033)\n- **Reliability stack hardens.** Tool-use, retrieval, typed APIs, constrained decoding, multi-agent cross-checking, and *programmatic evaluation* become standard. Systems are designed to *fail safely* and escalate to humans.\n- **Specialized agents take ground.** Logistics planning, tax/compliance drafting, pharmacovigilance, grid dispatch support, silicon verification, and formalizable back-office processes reach high degrees of automation (not 100%, but economically decisive).\n- **Energy and siting reshape geography.** Datacenters co-locate with firm power and cheap cooling. HVDC corridors, nuclear extensions/repowers, thermal storage, and industrial heat pumps scale. ESG debates turn pragmatic: *deliver electrons first, decarbonize steadily*.\n\n## Phase IV \u2014 Post-Scale Normalization (2034\u20132039)\n- **\u201cAI everywhere, spreadsheets cheaper.\u201d** AI is pervasive but less headline-grabbing. Margins migrate upstream (IP, data rights, safety tooling) and downstream (distribution, integration, change management).\n- **Human-in-the-loop becomes culture, not exception.** Organizations are redesigned around exception handling, governance, and incident response for AI-mediated workflows.\n- **Another hype mini-cycle.** A fresh architecture (e.g., hybrid neuro-symbolic/verification-aware, analog-adjacent, or photonics-rich) sparks a new optimism wave\u2014still bounded by energy, memory, and verification realities.\n\n---\n\n# 2) Technology arcs (where progress concentrates)\n\n**A. Reliability & Governance**\n- **From \u201csmart autocomplete\u201d to \u201cverifiable tooling.\u201d** Winning stacks wrap models with typed tools, sandboxed execution, reference checks, simulation harnesses, and *contract tests* for prompts/APIs. Hallucination rates drop in production not by model magic, but by *systems engineering and constraints*.\n- **Mechanistic interpretability \u2248 safety belt, not cure.** Useful for red-team and regression control, but still partial. Incident postmortems become a norm; insurers require minimum \u201cAI Safety Controls\u201d.\n- **Data exhaustion \u2192 data markets & provenance.** Licensed corpora, synthetic-but-audited data, process-tracing logs, and domain SMEs become scarce assets. Watermarking, lineage, and rights management are mainstream.\n\n**B. Models & Algorithms**\n- **Mixture-of-Experts + Retrieval + Tools** dominate. Pure \u201cbigger is better\u201d slows; *smarter routing* and *problem decomposition* outperform brute scale for enterprise tasks.\n- **Neuro-symbolic hybrids** re-emerge pragmatically: planners/DSLs/solvers + LMs for ambiguity handling.\n- **Evaluation becomes productized.** Domain-specific eval suites with signed baselines (versioned datasets + acceptance thresholds) gate releases, similar to FDA-style processes for high-risk functions.\n\n**C. Compute, Memory, and Networking**\n- **The memory wall is center stage.** Packaging, HBM capacity, CXL, in-memory and near-memory compute, and photonic interconnects matter more than TFLOPs headlines.\n- **Inference > training economics.** Optimization targets latency jitter, tail reliability, and $/verified-action. Batch-ingestion/offline inference workflows expand.\n- **On-prem + colo resurgence for regulated data.** Hybrid cloud wins where sovereignty and cost predictability matter.\n\n**D. Energy & Physical Infrastructure (without fusion)**\n- **Bridging on fission, gas, and wires.** Uprates, life-extensions, SMR pilots, peakers with CCS in select regions, plus *transmission and substations* are the real unlocks. Datacenters procure firm power directly and fund grid upgrades.\n- **Demand shaping and thermal storage.** Inference scheduling, flexible SLAs, chilled-water/ice storage, and electrolyzers as controllable load enter the toolbox.\n- **Water and siting constraints.** Dry cooling and coastal siting with desal/back-pressure recovery become competitive differentiators.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Business cycles & capital flows\n\n**Cycle 1 (\u201925\u2013\u201927):** Investment surge across AI infra, chips, grid, and \u201cagent\u201d software. Equity leadership is narrow; credit markets are receptive to data-center/utility capex.\n\n**Cycle 2 (\u201928\u2013\u201930):** Digestion. Post-hype revenue still grows, but *unit economics scrutiny* and *energy bottlenecks* trigger a valuation reset. Weaker players fold; M&A accelerates; open-weight and integrators pick up assets cheaply.\n\n**Cycle 3 (\u201931\u2013\u201933):** Productivity dividend shows in macro stats. Firms with verified automation gain margin and share; insurers and regulators codify AI controls. Utilities and EPCs enjoy multi-year backlogs; software multiples reward \u201cauditability.\u201d\n\n**Cycle 4 (\u201934\u2013\u201939):** Maturity and dispersion. AI becomes an input to most sectors; profits accrue to infrastructure monopolies/oligopolies (wires, substations, regulated assets), domain data owners, and integrators with distribution. Software TAM remains huge but pricing power migrates to reliability and compliance layers.\n\n**Asset classes most sensitive:**\n- **Winners:** Transmission/EPC, grid equipment, high-quality regulated utilities, cooling/thermal storage, HBM/memory supply chain, eval/governance vendors, domain data licensors, systems integrators with compliance chops.\n- **At risk:** Pure-play frontier-model vendors lacking distribution or data rights; generalist \u201cagent\u201d startups without reliability moats; energy plays predicated on near-term fusion; power-hungry businesses in constrained grids without firm PPAs.\n\n---\n\n# 4) Society & institutions\n\n- **Work reorganizes around exception handling.** Middle-skill roles don\u2019t vanish; they shift to supervising pipelines, resolving edge cases, and assuring compliance. *Verification literacy* becomes core.\n- **Education retools.** Less emphasis on rote outputs, more on problem formulation, supervision of agents, and domain judgment.\n- **Regulation normalizes.** Sectoral rules (finance, health, critical infra) require audits, incident reporting, data lineage, and *capability overhang* disclosures. Safety becomes a procurement checkbox similar to cybersecurity.\n- **Inequality dynamics:** Wage pressure for routine cognitive tasks; premium for *domain expertise + systems thinking + governance*. Regions with power and permitting agility attract capex and talent.\n\n---\n\n# 5) Tensions, failure modes, and wildcards\n\n- **Reliability incidents.** High-profile AI-induced outages or compliance failures (tax, healthcare, grid ops) trigger temporary pullbacks and stricter controls.\n- **Energy politics.** NIMBY vs. necessity battles around wires, substations, nuclear life-extensions; policy whiplash can delay ROI.\n- **Security & misuse.** Advanced synthesis for fraud and intrusion elevates baseline cybersecurity spend; model-stealing/weights-leaks drive defensive postures.\n- **Wildcards (low-probability, high-impact):** Step-change in memory tech or photonics; practical analog accelerators for search/optimization; a regulatory breakthrough that materially speeds fission project timelines; a fusion surprise (you made this low-probability\u2014keep monitoring anyway).\n\n---\n\n# 6) Leading indicators to track (quantitative North Stars)\n\n1. **Cost per verified task** vs. human baseline for target workflows.\n2. **Realized hallucination/incident rates** in production (per 10k actions), not benchmark claims.\n3. **Energy per 10^6 tokens / per task** and **firm power under contract** for major AI operators.\n4. **HBM capacity growth and $/GB**, CXL adoption, NIC bandwidth shipped to AI DCs.\n5. **Grid interconnection queue durations** and HVDC approvals in key regions.\n6. **Share of workflows with policy-grade evaluations** (externally auditable).\n7. **Data rights spend** as % of AI COGS (licensing, provenance, clean-room operations).\n8. **Insurance pricing/coverage** for AI-mediated operations\u2014tells you how actuaries view risk.\n\n---\n\n# 7) Strategic implications (how to be positioned)\n\n**For capital allocators**\n- Prefer *picks-and-shovels* with secular tailwinds (wires, substations, cooling, memory supply chain) and *software with verification moats* (eval, governance, safety-by-construction).\n- Be wary of revenue tied to *benchmarks and demos* rather than *audited production SLAs*.\n- Expect *valuation compression amid usage expansion*; size positions for multi-year hold through Cycle 2.\n\n**For enterprises**\n- Treat AI as **process re-engineering**, not feature sprinkling. Start with high-leverage, evaluable workflows; build an *evaluation and incident response* muscle early.\n- Secure **firm power + siting**; design for **demand shaping**.

In its latest report, the IEA highlights that the U.S., China, and the EU are expected to drive 80% of the projected growth in data centre demand by 2030, largely fueled by AI applications. However, in a \"headwind scenario\" influenced by trade conflicts, electricity consumption by data centres could fall to 670 TWh from the projected 945 TWh. In the U.S., data centres are predicted to account for nearly half of electricity demand growth through 2030. The surge in demand has prompted tech companies to overwhelm power utilities with capacity requests, possibly overestimating future power needs. Additionally, the IEA notes that 20% of planned data centre projects face delays due to grid strain and shortages of essential infrastructure. Notably, 50% of U.S. data centres under development are clustered in existing hubs, raising concerns about localized bottlenecks. The IEA aims to collaborate with tech firms to understand and manage the electricity needs crucial for AI expansion.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":79},"pub_date":1744258099.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/energy-demands-from-ai-datacentres-to-quadruple-by-2030-says-report","title":"Energy demands from AI datacentres to quadruple by 2030, says report","snippet":"A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) warns that global electricity demand from AI datacentres will more than double by 2030, with AI-specific data centers alone expected to quadruple in consumption. By then, the energy used for AI processing in the U.S. could surpass that of traditional energy-intensive industries like steel and cement manufacturing. Despite concerns, the IEA suggests AI could enhance energy efficiencies, potentially offsetting its carbon footprint by optimizing electricity grids, transportation systems, and industrial operations. However, only about half of AI's energy demand might be sourced from renewable resources. Critics, including former EU energy minister Claude Turmes, argue the IEA underplays the risks, asserting that unchecked AI proliferation may reverse energy efficiency gains and reinvigorate polluting energy sources like coal. Additionally, datacentres' high water consumption raises environmental concerns. Turmes calls for stronger regulatory frameworks to manage AI's environmental impact, criticizing the IEA for leniency potentially benefiting major tech firms and U.S. political interests.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":80},"pub_date":1744257618.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.barrons.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/productivity-falls-tariffs-economic-growth-1e947fe3","title":"Productivity Falls for First Time Since 2022. What That Means for Economic Growth.","snippet":"In the first quarter of 2025, U.S. nonfarm business-sector labor productivity fell by 0.8%, marking the first decline since Q2 2022 and defying economists' expectations of a 0.1% decrease. This drop is attributed mainly to reduced output and increasing labor costs, with output contracting by 0.3% and unit labor costs rising sharply at a 5.7% annualized rate. The surge in imports, driven by businesses anticipating new tariffs from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, contributed to the economic volatility. Analysts, including Oliver Allen of Pantheon Macroeconomics, caution that the productivity estimate may be understated due to data noise and external shocks. This decline follows a 1.5% productivity growth rate in Q4 2024 and 2.8% for the full year. Productivity, a key indicator of economic efficiency and driver of long-term growth, typically helps contain inflation and boost profit margins. However, protectionist trade policies are raising concerns about sustained productivity gains. Joe Brusuelas of RSM warns that such policies could hinder competition, misallocate resources, and threaten future economic stability, potentially undoing recent progress in improving productivity after decades of stagnation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":81},"pub_date":1746711660.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69117503f258832d887035a03980f131","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Comparing 2025 market cycle to dot-com eras","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"cb2018dd-5f49-4939-aa00-421d428973c4","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"56b11142-30d7-49f3-80a2-557d24ed8d0f","turn_exchange_id":"b6c13cff-9a76-4aa9-a9a8-7bbaa58860cb","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"56b11142-30d7-49f3-80a2-557d24ed8d0f","children":["ac47de53-7abc-4c2b-903f-cf44502c7130"]},"ac47de53-7abc-4c2b-903f-cf44502c7130":{"id":"ac47de53-7abc-4c2b-903f-cf44502c7130","message":{"id":"ac47de53-7abc-4c2b-903f-cf44502c7130","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762751754.24158,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering concentration data","content":"I\u2019ll focus on getting specifics about the top S&P 500 concentrations, particularly the top 7 companies.

The S&P 500, established in 1957, comprises 504 stocks from 500 leading U.S. companies, with a combined market cap of $52.8 trillion as of July 1, 2025. It uses a free-float, market capitalization-weighted system, meaning larger companies contribute more to index performance.\n\nTop components include Nvidia (8.06%), Microsoft (7.37%), Apple (5.76%), Amazon (4.11%), and Meta (3.12%). The index is heavily weighted toward tech, making sector performance impactful to its overall value. Companies must meet criteria\u2014such as a $22.7B market cap, profitability, and liquidity standards\u2014to be included. While the index itself is not directly investable, ETFs like SPY enable investors to gain exposure.

Nvidia alone now comprises 7.3% of the index, equal in weight to the smallest 231 companies combined. This marks the highest concentration held by a single company in 35 years. The broader phenomenon includes the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d tech stocks (Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Broadcom), which collectively make up 34% of the index. As S&P 500 funds are market-cap weighted, Nvidia\u2019s recent surge due to increasing AI chip demand means investors in such funds are heavily tilted toward tech, potentially compromising diversification.\n\nFor example, Nvidia accounted for about 20% of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF\u2019s (VOO) gains in 2025. Alternative strategies, like investing in equal-weight index ETFs (e.g., Invesco\u2019s RSP), offer more balance but have yielded lower returns this year.

Nvidia, along with Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon, has driven about 60% of the S&P 500's 12% total return for the year. Nvidia alone has accounted for roughly a third of the index's gain, becoming the world's second-most valuable company with a 147% increase in value this year. The top four stocks - Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet - made up nearly 24% of the S&P 500 by the end of May, the highest collective weight in 60 years. There are concerns that the market's performance is overly reliant on these few companies, creating potential vulnerability if their performance falters. However, some investors argue that the concentration is justified due to these companies' strong earnings and competitive positions, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector.

This significant investment highlights the surging interest in AI since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. AI development necessitates substantial computing power, leading to increased demand for specialized data centers that connect thousands of chips in clusters. Microsoft, as a major backer of OpenAI and a leader in the AI sector, aims to expand its data-center network with this investment. More than half of the $80 billion expenditure will target the United States. Analysts predict that Microsoft's fiscal 2025 capital expenditure, including capital leases, will total $84.24 billion.

In a recent report, she highlighted a chart comparing the top 10 most valuable stocks in the S&P 500's index weighting versus their share of total net income. These stocks \u2014 heavily steeped in AI, including companies like Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet \u2014 now account for over 44% of the S&P 500\u2019s value, an all-time high since 1990, but contribute only 34.3% of the index\u2019s total earnings. This 9.9 percentage-point gap nears the 10.3-point gap seen during the 2000 dot-com bubble, suggesting valuations may be outpacing earnings strength.\n\nWhile enthusiasm for AI, particularly following the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, has driven premiums on these stocks amid expected future profits, Calvasina notes the pace of this divergence has accelerated recently. Investor concerns have heightened following Meta\u2019s sharp decline after announcing higher AI spending, even as gains from firms like Amazon helped buoy broader indices. Still, the trend raises red flags about a possible overvaluation reminiscent of past bubbles.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1762208940.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.spglobal.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500-top-10-index/","title":"S&P 500 Top 10 Index | S&P Dow Jones Indices","snippet":"Weight Largest Constituent (%)20.4.

The S&P 500 often experiences gains following periods of extreme concentration, such as those seen in 1932, 1939, 1964, 2009, and 2020, with average returns 23% higher in the subsequent 12 months. Current market valuation metrics are more favorable than prior peaks like 2000, with today's top-10 stocks having lower median valuations and higher profits. While the overall market, especially the S&P 500, is up nearly 25% over recent months, even with signs of consolidation like Nvidia's recent drop, a massive correction isn't guaranteed. Analysts suggest diversifying with equal-weight indices and small caps to manage risk. Therefore, long-term investors should avoid panic selling and focus on staying invested through market fluctuations for potential higher future returns.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1710251941.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.slickcharts.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500","title":"S&P 500 Companies by Weight","snippet":"S&P 500 Index Components ; 10, Berkshire Hathaway \u00b7 BRK.B ; 11, JPMorgan Chase \u00b7 JPM ; 12, Lilly (Eli) \u00b7 LLY ; 13, Walmart \u00b7 WMT ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.slickcharts.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.td.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.td.com/ca/en/asset-management/insights/blog/growing-risk-behind-market-concentration","title":"The Growing Risk Behind Market Concentration","snippet":"17 Sept 2025 \u2014 Today, just 10 stocks make up roughly 36% of the S&P 500's total weight.[1] On the surface, this concentration has been a tailwind for investors ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.td.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/the-top-25-stocks-in-the-s-and-p-500-7554507","title":"Top 25 Stocks in the S&P 500","snippet":"The S&P 500 is a market capitalization-weighted index consisting of 500 prominent companies in the U.S., amounting to 503 stocks as of May 31, 2023, due to some companies having multiple classes of shares. The S&P 500 reflects U.S. economic conditions and includes large-cap companies. The index was established in 1957 and represents the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. Companies must meet specific criteria, including market capitalization and positive earnings, to be included. The index's market cap is calculated by multiplying the stock price by the number of outstanding shares. Larger companies significantly impact the index's value, while smaller companies have minimal influence. The top sectors by weight in the index include information technology and healthcare. As of June 27, 2023, the top 10 holdings in the S&P 500 include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA.

It was a year characterized by both remarkable gains and significant losses. According to IPO researcher Irv DeGraw, it was \"the best of times\" with an average first-day trading gain of 55% for over 400 companies, the second-highest yearly average ever. Companies collectively raised substantial funds, with estimates ranging from $65.8 billion to $92.8 billion, depending on factors like over-allotments. A notable IPO was AT&T's $10.6 billion offering for its wireless unit, the largest in U.S. history.\n\nHowever, the latter part of the year saw a sharp decline, particularly affecting internet stocks traded on Nasdaq. The average IPO lost 38% of its value from first-day closing to mid-December, with some dropping below $1, risking delisting. This year marked a stark contrast to 1999's substantial and sustained gains.

Despite this, the Fed remains open to the possibility of future rate hikes if inflation pressures intensify. The current decision follows a series of aggressive rate hikes that began in March 2022 aimed at combating inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle, as higher long-term rates and a decline in pay increases may help in reducing inflation. Financial markets responded positively to Powell's comments, with stock prices rising and bond yields falling. However, economic growth continues robustly, and inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. The recent increase in long-term Treasury yields has contributed to higher borrowing costs, which may help dampen economic activity and inflation without further rate hikes. Other central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, are similarly pausing their rate increases.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1698805839.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.axios.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/2022/11/30/fed-powell-inflation-no-progress","title":"Fed chair Powell: No \"clear progress\" toward lower inflation","snippet":"Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell announced on Wednesday that there has not been any clear progress in reducing the high inflation rates, despite multiple interest rate hikes and a slowing economy. This statement indicates the Federal Reserve's intention to continue raising interest rates higher than anticipated and maintain them at elevated levels throughout the next year to combat inflation. Powell emphasized at a Brookings Institution event that more evidence is needed to confirm a decline in inflation. The Fed has increased interest rates six times since March, with four of those increases being substantial 0.75 percentage points. There is a possibility that the aggressive rate hike pace might slow down as soon as the December meeting. Despite October's Consumer Price Index report suggesting a potential peak in inflation, Powell remains cautious and notes that past declines have often been followed by renewed increases in inflation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":53},"pub_date":1669836231.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6911af556cbc83209e23780bf2af7e21","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Analyzing Fed Policy: Greenspan vs Powell, Independence, and Responses","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"02e5ba3c-7e15-4e77-822a-76ba4ee5d013","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"324d3357-df50-4cdb-a8fb-1445734ee328","turn_exchange_id":"1143b49e-b81a-4241-9982-d45dc9ea256a","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"324d3357-df50-4cdb-a8fb-1445734ee328","children":["19d1dcb5-8ca5-4747-b91a-915d5d7eed14"]},"19d1dcb5-8ca5-4747-b91a-915d5d7eed14":{"id":"19d1dcb5-8ca5-4747-b91a-915d5d7eed14","message":{"id":"19d1dcb5-8ca5-4747-b91a-915d5d7eed14","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762766690.826284,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring Fed policies and market responses","content":"To address the \"less permissive\" claim, I\u2019ll compare the Fed\u2019s reactions during downturns.

He advised that it might be prudent to slow or pause rate reductions to carefully evaluate the economy. Musalem noted that recent data showed stubbornly high inflation near 3%, arguing for a measured approach to rate adjustments. The FOMC has already reduced the federal-funds rate by 0.75 percentage points since September, currently targeting a range of 4.5% to 4.75%.

This revision from an earlier forecast of two cuts in June and December comes amidst increased recession risks and tariff uncertainties, particularly surrounding President Donald Trump's expected \"reciprocal tariff\" policy announcement. The brokerage now considers a substantial increase in tariff rates more likely, which could contribute to short-term economic weakness. Consequently, Goldman Sachs has raised its 12-month recession probability from 20% to 35%. In March, the Fed maintained its interest rate at 4.25-4.50%, with Chair Jerome Powell acknowledging heightened economic uncertainty. Additionally, Goldman Sachs has reduced its fourth-quarter GDP growth forecast to 1.0% and adjusted its year-end unemployment rate projection to 4.5%.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1743401574.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/mar/31/world-markets-us-dollar-worst-month-2022-trump-trade-war-tariffs-investors-business-live-news","title":"Wall Street recovers from global sell-off as Trump tariffs fuel recession fears - as it happened","snippet":"Amid growing concerns over a global trade war, stock markets worldwide faced sharp declines in March 2025, marking the worst monthly losses since September 2022. Fears escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed his intent to impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs on all countries, which he plans to unveil on April 2, dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"\n\nDespite a late recovery on Wall Street\u2014where the Dow Jones rose 1% and the S&P 500 gained 0.55%\u2014March remained a grim month. The S&P 500 plunged 5.7%, now in correction territory, down over 10% from its February peak. Asian and European indexes also suffered, with Japan's Nikkei down 4% and major European markets losing up to 1.7%.\n\nGold hit a record high amid investor flight to safe assets, while the dollar had its worst month since 2022. Goldman Sachs raised the probability of a U.S. recession to 35%, cutting GDP and earnings forecasts. Meanwhile, the UK expects to be affected by the tariffs, potentially pushing it toward recession.

Excluding food and energy, the core PCE price index also increased by 0.2% in December, maintaining a year-end rate of 2.8% for three consecutive months. Despite peaking above 5.6% in 2022 and decreasing to 2.6% by June 2024, core PCE inflation has since accelerated. The Fed aims for a 2% target but projects this may not be achieved until 2027. Due to the slower progress in curbing inflation, the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady, pausing a sequence of rate cuts that started in September 2024. The December PCE figures aligned closely with economists' forecasts, as the data is based on earlier published government inflation statistics.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1738332960.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6911af556cbc83209e23780bf2af7e21","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for 2025 PCE inflation and financial indices","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"02e5ba3c-7e15-4e77-822a-76ba4ee5d013","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c177f0fb-eb9a-4166-98b9-6b03bde26c63","turn_exchange_id":"1143b49e-b81a-4241-9982-d45dc9ea256a","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c177f0fb-eb9a-4166-98b9-6b03bde26c63","children":["df5b82ec-6367-4ecb-b5bb-9caab9187d4e"]},"df5b82ec-6367-4ecb-b5bb-9caab9187d4e":{"id":"df5b82ec-6367-4ecb-b5bb-9caab9187d4e","message":{"id":"df5b82ec-6367-4ecb-b5bb-9caab9187d4e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762766711.802591,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing approach to permissiveness","content":"I need to ensure I'm using reliable sources\u2014official Fed pages and reputable ones like Reuters.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26 points, but the Wired Index, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 experienced slight increases. Despite the Fed\u2019s efforts to stabilize financial markets domestically and internationally, investors remain skeptical and are already speculating about further rate cuts. While some experts, like Christine Callies of Credit Suisse First Boston, predicted only short-term market reactions, the US market appears moderately valued with expected corporate profit growth. Tech and Internet stocks showcased various performances; Amazon.com soared due to its expanded product offerings, while Yahoo's new cyber-mall also boosted its stock.

This was the ninth rate cut of the year, aiming to encourage consumers and businesses to spend and invest, countering economic weakness. The Fed also cut the discount rate to 2 percent, a level not seen since 1958. The cuts are expected to reduce the prime lending rate to 5.50 percent, affecting millions of loans. Despite these measures, a recession appears unavoidable, with many predicting negative GDP growth for the remainder of the year.

Traders also raised the probability of another rate cut in October. Although the Fed indicated borrowing costs might fall this year, it moderated the pace of anticipated rate cuts, influenced by tariff plans from the Trump administration. U.S. rate futures now imply a 50 basis-point cut in 2025, consistent with the Fed\u2019s forecast and unchanged from projections in March and December. The Fed also reduced the outlook for cuts in 2026 and 2027 to 25 basis points each year. Freedom Capital Markets' strategist Jay Woods noted the Fed\u2019s cautious approach reflects ongoing economic uncertainty, despite no significant recent changes in economic data.

This shift implies that while the Fed's current rate-cutting cycle is on hold, it could resume if necessary, a situation described as \"pause lite\".

Compared with the Greenspan era, today\u2019s Fed (Powell) has been more willing to keep policy **restrictive** and to separate financial-stability plumbing from outright monetary easing\u2014even amid market pressure and politics.\n\n**Why I agree (with receipts):**\n- **Greenspan\u2019s \u201cput\u201d vs. Powell\u2019s stance.** Under Greenspan the Fed eased rapidly around market stress (1987 crash; three cuts incl. an **inter-meeting** cut during the 1998 LTCM crisis). That\u2019s the origin of the \u201cGreenspan put.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search10\ue201  \n- **Powell prioritized inflation credibility.** After the 2022\u201323 surge, Powell said policy would be \u201csufficiently restrictive\u201d and kept rates high until inflation neared ~3% YoY on core PCE before beginning to ease. That\u2019s a tighter, data-first reaction function than cutting at the first sign of market wobble. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n- **Real rates stayed positive before easing.** As of the Oct 29, 2025 decision, the funds rate is **3.75\u20134.00%** while core PCE was ~**2.9%** YoY\u2014i.e., still **positive real policy rates**. That isn\u2019t \u201cpermissive.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n- **Liquidity backstops, not broad easing.** The Fed let the **BTFP** expire on schedule (Mar 11, 2024) and **closed the arbitrage** in Jan 2024, signaling it wouldn\u2019t let an emergency facility morph into stealth stimulus. The newer **Standing Repo Facility** is a ceiling tool to manage market plumbing, not a risk-asset booster. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201  \n- **Balance sheet: QT concluded\u2014after inflation progress.** Only on **Oct 29, 2025** did the Fed both cut 25 bps **and** announce it would **end balance-sheet runoff on Dec 1**\u2014a normalization step timed to the macro, not to politics or a market dip. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n- **Independence rhetoric backed by behavior.** Powell has been unusually explicit about staying out of politics (mid-2024 remarks; 2025 statement after meeting with Trump) and the 2025 rate path/cut cadence is consistent with that messaging. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n\n**Caveat (so you\u2019re not blindsided):**\n- The Powell Fed *will* ease when the data turn (e.g., 2019\u2019s \u201cmid-cycle\u201d insurance cuts when inflation was below target), and it will open liquidity spigots in true crises (2020 pandemic). But those are **state-contingent** moves, not a standing promise to support asset prices. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn5search16\ue201\n\n**Bottom line:** relative to Greenspan, today\u2019s Fed has a higher bar for rate cuts and balance-sheet accommodation, and it has repeatedly underscored political independence. Expect **\u201crestrictive-until-compelled\u201d** policy rather than the old implied \u201cput.\u201d If inflation drifts back up or financial conditions ease too much on their own, they\u2019re unlikely to \u201ccave\u201d simply to keep liquidity high. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn2search8\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search10\ue201","start_idx":518,"end_idx":564,"safe_urls":["https://www.chicagofed.org/-/media/publications/economic-perspectives/2001/1qepart1-pdf.pdf","https://www.chicagofed.org/-/media/publications/economic-perspectives/2001/1qepart1-pdf.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/1998/19980929/","https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/1998/19980929/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2023/q1_federal_reserve","https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2023/q1_federal_reserve?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2023/q1_federal_reserve?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Fed, the Stock Market, and the \"Greenspan Put\"","url":"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2023/q1_federal_reserve?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1678251600.0,"snippet":"The \"put\" notion grew in 1998, when the Fed cut rates out of concern about the deteriorating state of global credit markets.

This new target is still 10.6% higher than the index's last close of 5,572.07. The S&P 500 experienced its largest one-day drop since December 18 on Monday, erasing $4 trillion from its recent peak. The steep decline is partly due to a 14% decrease in the share prices of the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks, leading their price-to-earnings ratio to drop from 30x to 26x. Analysts noted that the market's volatility was driven by heightened policy uncertainty related to tariffs, economic growth concerns, and a significant repositioning among hedge funds.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":57},"pub_date":1741753853.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.barrons.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/m2-money-supply-gain-22b793d5","title":"The M2 Money Supply Posts Its Biggest Gain in 30 Months","snippet":"In January 2025, the M2 money supply in the U.S. rose by 3.9%, marking the largest year-over-year increase since July 2022.

However, the total money supply, now at $21.56 trillion, includes $6.1 trillion more than pre-pandemic levels, posing potential challenges for the Federal Reserve's inflation control efforts. Despite Chairman Jerome Powell's stance that M2 lacks significant economic implications, some economists view it as a strong indicator of consumer spending and financial market activity.

Speaking in New York, Waller, a leading contender to succeed Jay Powell as Fed Chair, indicated he would back another 0.25% cut at the Fed's October 29 meeting, echoing recent remarks by Powell. The current federal funds rate is 4\u20134.25%, following a similar cut in September. However, Waller opposed a larger 0.5% cut, citing mixed signs from the economy, which remains strong due to AI-driven investment and high consumer spending among wealthy Americans.\n\nWaller emphasized a need for prudence, warning against hasty policy moves amid conflicting economic signals. He suggested more aggressive easing\u2014such as the cuts advocated by Trump ally Stephen Miran\u2014would only be justified if labor market conditions deteriorated and inflation remained stable. Miran, who supports a 1.25 percentage point reduction by year-end, has linked his push to renewed trade tensions with China. Despite Miran\u2019s urgings, Waller\u2019s stance suggests any rate adjustments will proceed gradually, disappointing those, including President Trump, seeking more aggressive monetary easing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":59},"pub_date":1760619686.938,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6911b1977e40832caf0ac068de15370c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Analyzing Fed Policy Impact on Economic Cycle Dynamics","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"101a6608-1cd4-4c22-966e-6ffd2091d9c3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"a20803db-1bc6-40a9-b826-d801c2cf7747","turn_exchange_id":"bc88e527-2532-4186-92aa-4793446aeb03","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a20803db-1bc6-40a9-b826-d801c2cf7747","children":["70115af5-a131-43cc-9752-cb2c2d8f5323"]},"70115af5-a131-43cc-9752-cb2c2d8f5323":{"id":"70115af5-a131-43cc-9752-cb2c2d8f5323","message":{"id":"70115af5-a131-43cc-9752-cb2c2d8f5323","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762767261.034651,"update_time":1762767261.042976,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"open\": [{\"ref_id\": \"turn0search6\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Reviewing FOMC PDF and press release details","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"101a6608-1cd4-4c22-966e-6ffd2091d9c3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"4630b2ae-cf7d-4694-b34d-2efff157f881","turn_exchange_id":"bc88e527-2532-4186-92aa-4793446aeb03","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"4630b2ae-cf7d-4694-b34d-2efff157f881","children":["79eec074-c6bd-4441-9968-ed40868749b6"]},"79eec074-c6bd-4441-9968-ed40868749b6":{"id":"79eec074-c6bd-4441-9968-ed40868749b6","message":{"id":"79eec074-c6bd-4441-9968-ed40868749b6","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1762767261.1450248,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.federalreserve.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm","title":"Federal Reserve Board -

The Options Adjusted Spread (OAS) on the ICE BofA High Yield Index climbed significantly from 342 bp the previous day. Investment-grade bond spreads also rose to 106 bp, the highest since August 2024. Junk bond spreads, which reflect investor risk appetites and credit market conditions, remain historically low compared to past crises, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic (over 1,000 bp) and the 2008 financial meltdown (above 2,100 bp), but the recent rising trend marks growing unease. The ICE BofA junk index experienced its steepest one-day drop since mid-2022, as investors shifted from risky assets to the safety of U.S. Treasuries. The yield on Treasuries fell further on Friday after China responded to Trump's tariffs with retaliatory measures, escalating trade tensions and renewing recession fears. Investment-grade bond prices rose slightly, though not as much as Treasury prices, deepening the spread gap.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1743767911.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/bed8b6d5-8ed8-4bd6-8cd9-e61f2e740644","title":"Surge in Chinese listings drives boom for US small-cap IPO market","snippet":"The U.S. small-cap IPO market is experiencing a significant boom, largely driven by a surge of Chinese firms listing on the Nasdaq. This increase, beginning in late 2024, saw 83 small IPOs in just two quarters\u201453 from China and Hong Kong\u2014making it the most active period in 15 years, according to Capital Markets Gateway. These IPOs often involve speculative ventures, with many stocks seeing steep drops post-listing despite occasional explosive gains like Diginex and EPWK Holdings. The rush precedes Nasdaq's new rule, effective April 11, requiring minimum capital raises for the smallest listings. Despite this stricter regulatory environment and trade tensions under the Trump administration, small IPOs persist, aided in part by speculative retail investor behavior. Prominent underwriters such as Dominari Securities and RF Lafferty have been especially active, with ties to key Trump properties and figures. While concerns about listing transparency and geopolitical risks remain, experts suggest U.S. policy changes are more likely to target major Chinese state-owned enterprises than the smaller firms now entering the U.S. market.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1747108831.281,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.kiplinger.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/ipos/government-shutdown-puts-ipo-resurgence-at-risk","title":"Government Shutdown Puts IPO Resurgence at Risk","snippet":"The article discusses the potential risk a U.S. government shutdown poses to the recent resurgence in the initial public offering (IPO) market. After a slowdown earlier in the year due to macroeconomic uncertainties, including tariff policies, IPO activity rebounded strongly in Q3 2025. A total of 64 IPOs raised $15.3 billion, marking the most active quarter since 2021. Notable IPOs included crypto firm Bullish and design software maker Figma, both initially successful but later underperforming. Texas-based data center developer Fermi also saw a successful debut, raising $683 million.\n\nHowever, the government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, threatens to stall this momentum. IPOs require regulatory review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is operating with minimal staff during the shutdown. While electronic filing systems like EDGAR remain functional, SEC staff are furloughed, delaying the review process for companies' filings, particularly the critical S-1 forms. Despite this disruption, experts remain optimistic that IPO activity will continue to grow if the shutdown is resolved promptly.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1759419890.0,"attribution":"www.kiplinger.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6911b1977e40832caf0ac068de15370c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching financial conditions, market trends, and economic impact","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"101a6608-1cd4-4c22-966e-6ffd2091d9c3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"ea10ee98-e3b2-4d7b-a114-a3abae86982c","turn_exchange_id":"bc88e527-2532-4186-92aa-4793446aeb03","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ea10ee98-e3b2-4d7b-a114-a3abae86982c","children":["c1f8f02a-1aa0-4bee-9092-1d187b612a51"]},"c1f8f02a-1aa0-4bee-9092-1d187b612a51":{"id":"c1f8f02a-1aa0-4bee-9092-1d187b612a51","message":{"id":"c1f8f02a-1aa0-4bee-9092-1d187b612a51","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762767287.97197,"update_time":1762767288.013292,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"Shiller CAPE November 2025 value\"}, {\"q\": \"S&P 500 CAPE ratio 2025 multpl.com\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"Shiller CAPE November 2025 value"},{"type":"search","q":"S&P 500 CAPE ratio 2025 multpl.com"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching Shiller CAPE ratio for November 2025","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"101a6608-1cd4-4c22-966e-6ffd2091d9c3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"0793a817-4e2e-4a5f-86ad-1f1e1b40e7bb","turn_exchange_id":"bc88e527-2532-4186-92aa-4793446aeb03","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"0793a817-4e2e-4a5f-86ad-1f1e1b40e7bb","children":["30fe4119-737e-4282-89b7-a7696a1faae6"]},"30fe4119-737e-4282-89b7-a7696a1faae6":{"id":"30fe4119-737e-4282-89b7-a7696a1faae6","message":{"id":"30fe4119-737e-4282-89b7-a7696a1faae6","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1762767288.222122,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_model_queries":{"type":"search_model_queries","queries":["Shiller CAPE November 2025 value","S&P 500 CAPE ratio 2025 multpl.com"]},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Shiller CAPE ratio for November 2025","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"101a6608-1cd4-4c22-966e-6ffd2091d9c3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c1f8f02a-1aa0-4bee-9092-1d187b612a51","turn_exchange_id":"bc88e527-2532-4186-92aa-4793446aeb03","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c1f8f02a-1aa0-4bee-9092-1d187b612a51","children":["7d3bbb99-dbfe-41a2-b465-8eb413f3631b"]},"7d3bbb99-dbfe-41a2-b465-8eb413f3631b":{"id":"7d3bbb99-dbfe-41a2-b465-8eb413f3631b","message":{"id":"7d3bbb99-dbfe-41a2-b465-8eb413f3631b","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1762767288.2187328,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.multpl.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe","title":"Shiller PE Ratio","snippet":"Shiller PE ratio for the S&P 500.

It highlights the CAPE ratio, developed by economist Robert Shiller, as a key metric for determining whether stock prices are overvalued. Historically, high CAPE ratios have preceded market crashes, like in 1929 and 2000. As of December 2023, the S&P 500 CAPE ratio stood at 32.22, higher than before the 2008 crash but not as high as before the 2000 dot-com bust.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's historical and current monetary policies play a significant role in market dynamics, and tightening policies can have unintended consequences, as seen in 1929. Modern measures like quantitative easing and circuit breakers have been introduced to mitigate crash impacts. However, evolving risks such as computer-driven trading and global economic interconnectedness continue to pose threats. Despite numerous warning signs and efforts to predict market movements, crashes remain unpredictable. Notably, severe losses occur when panic selling follows a crash, underscoring the importance of measured responses and long-term investment perspectives.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1516116900.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/capex-supercycle-and-governments-running-it-hotpersuade-bnp-strategists-to-boost-target-prices-for-s-p-500-and-eurostoxx-600-d09ff182","title":"Government spending and capital expenditure 'supercycle' drive latest S&P 500 target boost","snippet":"BNP Paribas Exane has raised its year-end target for the S&P 500 from 5,900 to 6,700, driven by increased government spending across the U.S., Europe, and China, along with potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The updated forecast assumes 6% EPS growth this year and 8% next year, with a stable P/E ratio of 28. BNP estimates a further upside is possible should the P/E expand to 30, pushing the S&P up to 7,100. The outlook is underpinned by expectations that Trump's finalized tariffs won't exceed current announcements, inflationary effects are temporary, and corporations will successfully pass costs onto consumers.\n\nDespite the positive long-term outlook, BNP strategists, led by Dennis Jose, caution of a short-term market correction due to potential bond-market instability, inflation from tariffs, and large fiscal deficits caused by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

In its latest report, the IEA highlights that the U.S., China, and the EU are expected to drive 80% of the projected growth in data centre demand by 2030, largely fueled by AI applications. However, in a \"headwind scenario\" influenced by trade conflicts, electricity consumption by data centres could fall to 670 TWh from the projected 945 TWh. In the U.S., data centres are predicted to account for nearly half of electricity demand growth through 2030. The surge in demand has prompted tech companies to overwhelm power utilities with capacity requests, possibly overestimating future power needs. Additionally, the IEA notes that 20% of planned data centre projects face delays due to grid strain and shortages of essential infrastructure. Notably, 50% of U.S. data centres under development are clustered in existing hubs, raising concerns about localized bottlenecks. The IEA aims to collaborate with tech firms to understand and manage the electricity needs crucial for AI expansion.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1744258099.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ai-forecast-to-fuel-doubling-in-data-centre-electricity-demand-by-2030-htd2zf7nx","title":"AI forecast to fuel doubling in data centre electricity demand by 2030","snippet":"The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that global electricity consumption by data centres will more than double by 2030, with artificial intelligence (AI) expected to be the primary driver. Data centres could consume 945 terawatt-hours annually by then, almost triple the UK\u2019s 2023 usage. AI-optimized centres are projected to quadruple in electricity demand, though total data centre consumption will still represent only 3% of global electricity use. Despite concerns, the IEA believes AI's contribution to climate change may be overstated, noting emissions from data centres may rise to 300 million tonnes by 2035\u2014under 1.5% of global energy emissions\u2014while AI-driven efficiencies could reduce energy-related emissions by around 5%. Major tech companies are pursuing nuclear power deals to mitigate supply issues. However, increased pressure on electricity grids and regional disparities in power availability pose challenges. In the UK, companies advocate for zonal pricing to incentivize data centre development in high wind-energy regions like northern Scotland.

By then, the energy used for AI processing in the U.S. could surpass that of traditional energy-intensive industries like steel and cement manufacturing. Despite concerns, the IEA suggests AI could enhance energy efficiencies, potentially offsetting its carbon footprint by optimizing electricity grids, transportation systems, and industrial operations. However, only about half of AI's energy demand might be sourced from renewable resources. Critics, including former EU energy minister Claude Turmes, argue the IEA underplays the risks, asserting that unchecked AI proliferation may reverse energy efficiency gains and reinvigorate polluting energy sources like coal. Additionally, datacentres' high water consumption raises environmental concerns. Turmes calls for stronger regulatory frameworks to manage AI's environmental impact, criticizing the IEA for leniency potentially benefiting major tech firms and U.S. political interests.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1744257618.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6911b1977e40832caf0ac068de15370c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching

While ECB rate cuts had boosted some lending demand, overall credit growth remains moderate amid ongoing geopolitical and tariff-related uncertainty. Credit standards remained unchanged in France, Italy, and Spain. Despite tighter credit, corporate loan demand modestly increased, driven by lower lending rates and needs for debt refinancing or restructuring. Lending for businesses grew by 2.9% in September\u2014a near two-year high but still below pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, banks expect stable credit standards and loan volumes in the fourth quarter. For housing loans, standards remained steady across the bloc, although Germany again tightened access.

This marks the first positive demand report in two years. Despite this rise, banks have tightened lending standards for these loans. The increase in business loan demand could be attributed to the Fed's 100 basis points interest rate cut last year. However, demand for other loans such as commercial real estate, household real estate, credit cards, and consumer loans either remained unchanged or weakened, with auto loan demand remaining stable. Fed officials considered these findings along with economic conditions and policy uncertainties when deciding to maintain the short-term borrowing costs in the range of 4.25%-4.50%.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1738618026.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-survey-finds-tighter-standards-weaker-demand-loans-first-quarter-2025-05-12/","title":"Fed survey finds general ease in first-quarter credit demand","snippet":"A Federal Reserve survey released on May 12, 2025, revealed a marked decline in credit demand from businesses and consumers during the first quarter of the year, signaling a reversal from the brief increase seen in the previous quarter. The drop in demand was most pronounced among small firms, marking the weakest interest in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans in a year, while large firms also showed reduced borrowing interest. Concurrently, banks tightened lending standards for business loans to levels not seen in over a year, citing economic uncertainty, regulatory concerns, and decreased risk tolerance.\n\nHousehold lending standards remained relatively steady, although demand fell across residential real estate, credit cards, and other consumer loans. The drop in credit card demand was the most significant since Q2 2020. The uncertain economic climate was partly attributed to President Trump's return and his aggressive trade policies, including high tariffs, which have clouded the economic outlook, potentially driving up inflation and unemployment.\n\nHowever, optimism returned on the announcement of a temporary trade deal with China, easing some tariff pressures and boosting financial markets. The deal prompted traders to delay expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut until September, according to Fed Governor Adriana Kugler.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1747083937.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"eyeonhousing.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://eyeonhousing.org/tag/sloos/","title":"Tag: Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS)","snippet":"According to the Federal Reserve Board's July 2024 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS), lending standards were essentially unchanged for all residential ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"eyeonhousing.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6911b1977e40832caf0ac068de15370c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey results","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"101a6608-1cd4-4c22-966e-6ffd2091d9c3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"58c23532-e534-4c2f-bc9d-1e0dcc26f5df","turn_exchange_id":"bc88e527-2532-4186-92aa-4793446aeb03","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"58c23532-e534-4c2f-bc9d-1e0dcc26f5df","children":["a048b114-a094-4fd3-b553-07d856a23bfe"]},"a048b114-a094-4fd3-b553-07d856a23bfe":{"id":"a048b114-a094-4fd3-b553-07d856a23bfe","message":{"id":"a048b114-a094-4fd3-b553-07d856a23bfe","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762767332.041264,"update_time":1762767332.057095,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"finance\": [{\"ticker\": \"SPY\", \"type\": \"fund\", \"market\": \"USA\"}, {\"ticker\": \"QQQ\", \"type\": \"fund\", \"market\": \"USA\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Crafting analysis with financial data and visuals","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"101a6608-1cd4-4c22-966e-6ffd2091d9c3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"59d901d0-6f85-45fd-a658-680088691f2b","turn_exchange_id":"bc88e527-2532-4186-92aa-4793446aeb03","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"59d901d0-6f85-45fd-a658-680088691f2b","children":["75d41da4-ad6e-4963-b7c6-a35ceaa8bc75"]},"75d41da4-ad6e-4963-b7c6-a35ceaa8bc75":{"id":"75d41da4-ad6e-4963-b7c6-a35ceaa8bc75","message":{"id":"75d41da4-ad6e-4963-b7c6-a35ceaa8bc75","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1762767332.2151444,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6911b1977e40832caf0ac068de15370c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Crafting analysis with financial data and visuals","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"101a6608-1cd4-4c22-966e-6ffd2091d9c3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"a048b114-a094-4fd3-b553-07d856a23bfe","turn_exchange_id":"bc88e527-2532-4186-92aa-4793446aeb03","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a048b114-a094-4fd3-b553-07d856a23bfe","children":["8e95ee87-0c8d-4fd4-abcd-2b768077be91"]},"8e95ee87-0c8d-4fd4-abcd-2b768077be91":{"id":"8e95ee87-0c8d-4fd4-abcd-2b768077be91","message":{"id":"8e95ee87-0c8d-4fd4-abcd-2b768077be91","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1762767332.4789858,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\u3010turn6finance0\u3011 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is a fund in the USA market.

Georgieva emphasized the urgency of preparing workers and businesses for these changes, noting that AI has the potential to boost productivity but also risks increasing misinformation and inequality. She remarked on the global economy's exposure to recent shocks, such as the 2020 pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine, while noting its resilience as global recession fears were not realized last year. Inflation, although strong, is now declining. Additionally, Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan commented that Switzerland's inflation battle is advanced, with the current rate well within the target range, but he cautioned about future uncertainties.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51},"pub_date":1715623531.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"codingscape.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://codingscape.com/blog/40-percent-of-global-employment-is-exposed-to-ai-imf-report","title":"40% of global employment is exposed to AI \u2013 IMF report","snippet":"Nearly 40% of jobs worldwide are at risk from AI, with advanced economies facing higher exposure but also greater potential to leverage AI benefits.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15},"pub_date":1711403544.0,"attribution":"codingscape.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.cesi.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cesi.org/posts/oecd-27-of-jobs-at-high-risk-from-ai","title":"OECD: 27% of jobs at high risk from AI","snippet":"13 Jul 2023 \u2014 The OECD reveals that jobs with a high risk of automation constitute approximately 27% on average across OECD countries.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.cesi.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/17/ai-may-accelerate-job-losses-and-carbon-emissions-report-finds","title":"AI may accelerate job losses and carbon emissions, report finds","snippet":"Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence could lead to short-term increases in unemployment, a rise in carbon emissions and leave regulators trailing in the wake of technological advances, according to an international panel of experts. The inaugural report on the safety of advanced AI, chaired by leading computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, raised concerns about a technology that has gained significant political and regulatory attention. The report, commissioned by the UK government and involving 30 countries, highlights the potential impacts of general-purpose AI on the labor market, with the automation of tasks threatening various professions. While new roles may be created to offset job losses, the transition could result in short-term unemployment due to labor market frictions. Additionally, the growing use of datacentres to operate AI models like ChatGPT could substantially increase CO2 emissions. The panel warns that regulators may struggle to keep pace with rapid technological advancements, and societal and governmental decisions will significantly influence AI's future progression. The report also addresses risks related to bias in AI models and the potential loss of control over AI systems.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1715963833.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-affect-about-40-percent-global-jobs-imf-2024-1","title":"AI will affect about 40% of global jobs: IMF","snippet":"IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicts that AI will impact around 40% of jobs globally, with advanced economies facing greater risks and opportunities due to AI's effect on high-skilled jobs. Georgieva noted that approximately 60% of jobs in advanced economies could be affected, with half potentially benefiting from increased productivity while the other half may see a reduction in labor demand, wages, and hiring. In extreme cases, some jobs may disappear. Emerging markets and developing economies are expected to experience fewer immediate AI disruptions. Georgieva emphasized the need for policymakers to address potential inequalities and social tensions by implementing social safety nets and retraining programs. This perspective aligns with warnings from other institutions like Goldman Sachs, which reported that AI could disrupt over 300 million jobs, and LinkedIn's Annesh Raman, who highlighted the growing importance of soft skills over technical skills.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52},"pub_date":1705290770.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/how-ai-is-used-in-business-8611256","title":"How AI Is Used in Business","snippet":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the business world by improving workflows, customer engagement, data analysis, and automating tasks.

However, the thinktank suggests that the long-term rise in unemployment will be relatively modest, peaking at a few hundred thousand as AI also creates new roles. The annual displacement could reach 60,000 to 275,000 jobs at its peak. Despite the disruptions, job losses will be offset by new jobs generated through increased productivity and economic growth driven by AI, potentially raising GDP by up to 6% by 2035. The report emphasized the importance of upgrading the UK's labor market infrastructure with mechanisms like an early warning system to manage AI's impact on employment. AI is likely to affect administrative, secretarial, sales, and customer service jobs the most, while construction jobs will be less impacted. The thinktank also mentioned scenarios are dependent on developments in AI technology and related policies.

Speaking to Axios, Amodei emphasized that the rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models, is overtaking many human tasks, especially in fields like law, finance, consulting, and technology. Despite these threats, Amodei criticized both the government and AI companies for downplaying the risks, fearing panic or losing ground to China in the AI race.\n\nRecent data from SignalFire supports these claims, showing a steep decline in entry-level hiring, with early-career hires at major tech firms and startups significantly reduced since 2023. Experienced professionals equipped with AI tools are increasingly preferred for junior roles. Additionally, negative stereotypes about Gen Z workers and tighter industry budgets contribute to this trend.\n\nAmodei urged proactive government response and transparency from AI developers while reiterating the importance of public dialogue about AI\u2019s societal impact.

That combination supports your \u201clonger, lumpier\u201d boom, but it also argues for **rotation** in equity leadership, **pricing power shifting to verified-productivity vendors**, and **policy risk** around inequality.\n\n## What credible evidence says about displacement (enough to matter, not apocalypse)\n- **Exposure is large; outright job loss is uneven.** IMF estimates ~**40%** of global jobs and **~60%** of advanced-economy jobs are exposed to AI; roughly **half** of the exposed roles may face negative effects (lower wages/hiring), the rest likely see augmentation. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search10\ue202turn7search5\ue201  \n- **Magnitude of unemployment bump looks modest in the base case.** Goldman\u2019s 2025 work estimates a **~0.5 pp** temporary rise in unemployment during the transition. That\u2019s material for households but not macro-catastrophic. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search14\ue201  \n- **Employer intent is mixed but real.** WEF\u2019s 2025 survey: **~40%** of employers expect headcount reductions where tasks can be automated\u2014counterbalanced by new roles. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search14\ue201  \n- **Quality of impact differs by occupation.** ILO finds the strongest substitution pressure in **clerical/administrative** work; many other functions skew toward **augmentation**. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search12\ue201  \n- **Long-run risk pockets persist.** OECD\u2019s broader automation lens still flags **~27%** of jobs in high-risk occupations across member countries. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search6\ue201\n\n## Macro mechanics: how job losses feed into the cycle\n1. **Productivity vs. demand:**  \n   - As firms replace/augment routine cognitive labor, **unit costs fall** and measured productivity rises. That\u2019s **disinflationary** for many services, easing pressure on the Fed to keep policy tight even as growth continues. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search9\ue201  \n   - Offsetting this, displaced cohorts spend less for a time\u2014so consumption growth is choppier and **sector-specific demand air-pockets** emerge.\n\n2. **Rates & policy path:**  \n   - With AI-driven disinflation and only a modest unemployment uptick, base case is **gradual easing** (positive real rates maintained), not emergency cuts. That stance **lengthens** the cycle by curbing credit binges while letting productivity gains compound. (This aligns with your \u201cless-permissive Fed elongates expansions\u201d thesis.)\n\n3. **Profits and margins:**  \n   - Near-term, margin tailwinds accrue to adopters in customer support, claims processing, software maintenance, tax/compliance drafting\u2014functions that lend themselves to **verified agents + human exception handling**.  \n   - As adoption diffuses, **price competition** passes a chunk of those gains to customers; winners keep a premium only where they control **data rights, distribution, or reliability tooling**.\n\n4. **Inequality & politics (the wildcard):**  \n   - If displacement concentrates in clerical and entry-level white-collar roles, inequality widens without policy offsets. Expect **skills tax credits, rapid-retraining subsidies, portability of benefits**, possibly experimentation with **wage insurance**. Poorly designed responses (or abrupt taxation of \u201cautomation capital\u201d) would dull the productivity dividend and raise policy risk premia.\n\n## Investment & strategy implications (relative to our prior view)\n- **Cycle shape:** Expect a **longer expansion with rolling mini-recessions** by occupation/region. That reinforces the call to avoid chasing one final melt-up; instead, **buy the drawdowns** in businesses that convert AI into *audited, reliable* outputs.\n- **Leadership shift:**  \n  - **Structural beneficiaries:** evaluation/governance stacks; domain-specific integrators; data-rights owners; memory/interconnect vendors (more inference, more tokens); utilities/transmission (productivity \u2260 power-free).  \n  - **At risk:** labor-arbitrage BPOs, generic content farms, entry-level \u201cticket-taking\u201d SaaS, and companies priced for perpetual cheap labor or infinite seat expansion.\n- **Earnings model tweak:** Build in **labor-line compression** where routine cognitive tasks are heavy, but discount some of it via **price normalization** and **compliance overhead** (auditability, incident reporting).\n- **Regional divergence:** Jurisdictions with **permitting reform, retraining pipelines, and firm power** capture more capex and attenuate unemployment spikes. (This is why we keep stressing grid/transmission as a meta-beta.)\n\n## Scenarios to fold into your portfolio sizing\n- **Base (\u224860%) \u2014 \u201cAugment-heavy, modest unemployment bump\u201d:** Unemployment +0.3\u20130.8 pp peak, inflation trend glides lower with productivity; Fed eases slowly; equity returns compound with **periodic 10\u201320% rotations**. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search14\ue201  \n- **Displacement shock (\u224825%) \u2014 \u201cHarder landing in services\u201d:** Unemployment +1\u20132 pp concentrated in admin/support roles; services demand dips; Fed cuts faster but risk premia widen; quality factor outperforms; infra and verification software still bid. (Consistent with high exposure shares. ) \ue200cite\ue202turn7search10\ue201  \n- **Policy-cushioned (\u224815%) \u2014 \u201cFiscal offsets\u201d:** Strong retraining/wage insurance cushions demand; deficits rise; disinflation slows; rates settle higher than markets expect; infra and profitable software still win, long-duration no-profit stories lag.\n\n## What to monitor (early, falsifiable signals)\n1. **Occupational unemployment & hours** in clerical/admin vs. professional/scientific roles; divergence = rising displacement. (ILO/WEF warned this skew.) \ue200cite\ue202turn7search12\ue202turn8search14\ue201  \n2. **Wage growth** spread: routine-cognitive vs. non-routine-manual and analytical. A widening negative spread strengthens the disinflation and inequality channels.  \n3. **Incidence of \u201cAI-mediated\u201d service price cuts** (claims handling, support SLAs) vs. margin protection\u2014tells you pass-through dynamics.  \n4. **Capex and hiring guides** from BPO, call-center, office support, and entry-level professional services vs. integrators/safety vendors.  \n5. **Policy pipeline:** concrete movement on retraining credits, wage insurance, or automation-linked tax proposals\u2014directionally crucial for multiples.\n\n### Bottom line\nAI-related job losses don\u2019t break the cycle; they **reshape** it.
