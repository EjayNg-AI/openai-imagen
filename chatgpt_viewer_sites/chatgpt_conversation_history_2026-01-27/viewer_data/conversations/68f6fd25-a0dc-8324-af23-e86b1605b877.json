P. May \u2014 *A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology*, \u201cCompactly generated spaces\u201d sections.**  \nMay builds homotopical constructions assuming compact generation/weak Hausdorffness; you\u2019ll see how geometric realization, classifying spaces, and colimits are handled cleanly in that setting. (E.g., remarks around compactly generated colimits and product preservation.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n8) **Jardine (lecture notes): CGWH and the model structure.**  \nConcise notes giving characterizations like \u201cX is WH iff the diagonal is closed in X\u00d7X,\u201d and where CGWH fits the Serre/Hurewicz model structures.

CGWH fixes these pathologies \u201cjust enough\u201d: you get exponential laws with the k-ified compact-open topology, better behavior of pushouts (e.g., along closed inclusions), and colimits that play well with homotopy theory (geometric realization, cell attachments). For a compact motivation list, see Wikipedia and Strickland; for a community perspective, also see MathOverflow discussions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn2search6\ue201\n\n- **Categorical properties (what\u2019s actually true).**  \nCGWH is **complete and cocomplete**; limits/colimits are created by the underlying-set functor with mild repairs (k-ify, enforce WH), and the category is **cartesian closed** with function spaces built from the compact-open topology then k-ified. Strickland gives precise pushout/pullback and quotient-stability statements; Wikipedia gives the quick checklist. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue202turn2search15\ue201\n\n- **Model-category context.**  \nWhen you put a Quillen model structure on spaces, the convenient categories (like CGWH) are the right base for enrichment, tensor/cotensor, and simplicial/topological framings. Hovey is the general reference; MMSS shows the pay-off in stable homotopy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn4search0\ue201\n\n# A minimal \u201ccheat sheet\u201d (facts you\u2019ll reuse)\n\n- **Definitions** (Strickland):  \nX is *k* if open/closed sets are detected on compact Hausdorff probes; *WH* if images of compact Hausdorff are closed; **CGWH** = both. Lemma 1.4(c) is your internal test for k-closed subsets. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201\n\n- **Exponentials**: CGWH is cartesian closed; mapping spaces are compact-open, then k-ified (so [X\u2192Y] exists, and the exponential law holds). Background \u201cwhy Top is not cartesian closed\u201d in Borceux/Escard\u00f3; \u201chow to fix it\u201d in Strickland. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn3view0\ue201\n\n- **(Co)limits**: Completeness, cocompleteness; pushouts along closed inclusions stay in CGWH; quotients are well-behaved (see Strickland\u2019s Prop. 2.35\u20132.40-style results). \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201\n\n- **Homotopy-colimit constructions**: geometric realizations and sequential colimits work as expected (this is where many texts assume CGWH without fanfare). May and MMSS use this constantly. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn4search0\ue201\n\n# How I\u2019d study this efficiently (given your background)\n\n1) Read **Strickland** cover-to-cover once;

\ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn5search0\ue201  \n4) When you move into model categories or spectra, check **Hovey** and **MMSS** to see CGWH used in anger.
