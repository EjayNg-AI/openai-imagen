Here's how it's computed:\n\n1. **Obtain Predictions**: First, the logistic regression model is used to make predictions on the test dataset. These predictions are probabilities that a given instance belongs to the positive class.\n\n2. **Sort Predictions**: Next, the predicted probabilities are sorted in descending order. Along with these predictions, the true class labels are also considered.\n\n3. **Compute True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) and False Positive Rate**: Starting from the lowest threshold, the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are calculated for each threshold value. TPR is also known as sensitivity and is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of actual positives. FPR is calculated as the number of false positives divided by the total number of actual negatives.\n\n4. **Plot ROC Curve**: The TPR is plotted on the y-axis, and the FPR is plotted on the x-axis. This results in a curve known as the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve.\n\n5. **Calculate AUC**: The AUC is then computed as the area under the ROC curve. This area ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 represents a perfect classifier, and a value of 0.5 represents a random classifier.\n\nIn summary, the AUC metric provides a single scalar value representing the performance of the classifier across all possible threshold values. Higher AUC values indicate better performance in distinguishing between the two classes."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","default_model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa2767b-6d3d-4daa-b6ea-6e0916d58413","request_id":"87e4f0700fad9e23-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2767b-6d3d-4daa-b6ea-6e0916d58413","children":[]}}}
