For the less adventurous, foie gras with garlic bread or Japanese wagyu paired with pan-fried liver provide decadent alternatives.

You could use \u201clamb offal curry\u201d as a softer alternative.  \n\nWould you like me to rewrite this as:  \n- **(a)** a formal menu description (fine dining tone),  \n- **(b)** a playful social-media style caption, or  \n- **(c)** keep it in this witty \u201cunderground supper club\u201d style?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"986435ba7aa43d99-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"0ef8f4af-0c75-44f1-9193-ea185e114f3b","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0ef8f4af-0c75-44f1-9193-ea185e114f3b","children":[]}}}
