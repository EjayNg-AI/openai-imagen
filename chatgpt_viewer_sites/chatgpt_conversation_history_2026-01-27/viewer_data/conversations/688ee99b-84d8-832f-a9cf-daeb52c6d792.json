Will assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum become integral to the global financial system, or will they remain volatile niches suppressed by policy and competition? This analysis examines both the **bull case** (optimistic scenario) and **bear case** (pessimistic scenario) for crypto over the next 20 years. We consider how major powers\u2019 monetary policies, the global currency landscape, and the explosion of technology (especially AI) might shape these outcomes. The focus is on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and China\u2019s central bank digital currency (the e-CNY), with scenario analysis and **probabilistic forecasts** to gauge the likelihood of each trajectory.\n\n## Monetary Policy Trajectories (US, China) and Global Currency Trends  \n**United States \u2013 Debt, Inflation, and Policy:** The U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions in coming years will critically influence crypto\u2019s fate. If the U.S. continues high deficit spending and accommodative monetary policy, it could fuel inflation or currency debasement, strengthening the bull case for Bitcoin as a **scarce, inflation-hedging asset** (often likened to \u201cdigital gold\u201d)\u30108\u2020L1039-L1047\u3011. In a worst-case fiscal scenario \u2013 for example, a U.S. debt crisis by the 2040s \u2013 the dollar\u2019s value could **sharply decline**, prompting ordinary Americans to seek refuge in Bitcoin much as people in unstable economies flee to the dollar today\u301017\u2020L182-L190\u3011\u301017\u2020L192-L200\u3011. Indeed, one 2025 analysis warned that without major budget reform, U.S. federal debt could reach unsustainable levels by the 2040s, forcing a \u201c**fiscal reckoning**\u201d that might drive citizens toward crypto as the dollar falters\u301017\u2020L182-L190\u3011\u301017\u2020L192-L200\u3011. However, the government\u2019s *response* in such a crisis would be pivotal. In a restrictive scenario, U.S. authorities might try to **suppress crypto** via capital controls, heavy taxation, or even a central bank digital currency (CBDC) designed to monitor and limit transactions\u301017\u2020L199-L207\u3011. This would represent a bear-case outcome where Bitcoin faces Venezuela-style financial repression in the face of a collapsing fiat regime. By contrast, a reformist scenario could see policymakers embrace sound money principles\u2014**even backing the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin reserves** to restore confidence, as an optimistic (if less likely) scenario suggests\u301017\u2020L210-L218\u3011. In short, if U.S. monetary policy remains prudent and the dollar stays strong, crypto may have less of a crisis-driven boost; but if policies lead to debasement or crisis, crypto\u2019s appeal as an alternative could surge (unless governments clamp down in response). \n\n**China \u2013 Strict Control and the Digital Yuan:** China\u2019s monetary stance is fundamentally different: the government has largely banned decentralized cryptocurrencies and instead rolled out its own central bank e-currency (the **digital yuan, or e-CNY**). Over the next 20 years, China is likely to continue leveraging the e-CNY to bolster its monetary control domestically and to promote the renminbi internationally \u2013 a trajectory that presents both challenges and opportunities for crypto. Thus far, the digital yuan has been used mainly for domestic retail payments (over 7 trillion yuan in transactions by mid-2024)\u301026\u2020L53-L60\u3011. It functions as a **fully state-controlled digital cash** for everyday transactions (from paying salaries to transit fares) without needing a bank account\u301026\u2020L49-L57\u3011. Importantly, current policy **limits the e-CNY\u2019s convertibility** \u2013 it *cannot* be freely exchanged for foreign currencies yet\u301026\u2020L57-L64\u3011. This implies that in the near term, China\u2019s CBDC is not a direct global rival to Bitcoin or the U.S. dollar; it\u2019s more a tool of domestic convenience and control. However, China is actively experimenting with cross-border digital yuan use through projects like mBridge (with the BIS)\u301026\u2020L57-L64\u3011. In the coming decades, if China relaxes convertibility and **integrates the e-CNY into international trade**, it could start chipping away at the dollar\u2019s dominance in certain regions. Stanford\u2019s Darrell Duffie notes that the e-CNY, combined with China\u2019s alternative payments infrastructure (like the CIPS network), *could eventually undermine the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance in international payments* if widely adopted\u301025\u2020L197-L201\u3011. For instance, the PBoC has tested systems where a tourist in Hong Kong can pay via e-CNY on their phone, and the merchant instantly receives HK dollars \u2013 bypassing the dollar-based SWIFT system\u301025\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301025\u2020L188-L196\u3011. Such developments indicate China\u2019s intent to **reduce reliance on Western financial rails and the dollar**. In a bull scenario for crypto, this fragmentation of the global system might drive some actors toward neutral, decentralized currencies (as trust in any one nation\u2019s currency wanes). In a bear scenario, however, widespread adoption of state digital currencies like the e-CNY could crowd out decentralized crypto for mainstream usage, especially if other major central banks follow suit.\n\n**Global Reserve Currencies \u2013 USD, EUR, and the Crypto Wildcard:** Today\u2019s global financial system is anchored by the U.S. dollar, which as of 2024 comprises about **58% of disclosed foreign exchange reserves**\u301031\u2020L107-L115\u3011. The euro (\u224820%), yen, and pound make up most of the rest\u301031\u2020L107-L115\u3011. Despite talk of \u201cde-dollarization\u201d by blocs like BRICS and statements from figures such as the ECB\u2019s Christine Lagarde that the dollar\u2019s dominant role \u201cis no longer certain\u201d\u301031\u2020L107-L115\u3011\u301031\u2020L111-L119\u3011, most analysts believe the dollar\u2019s **\u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d** will endure for at least the next couple of decades\u301031\u2020L60-L68\u3011\u301031\u2020L140-L147\u3011. This base-case view \u2013 that no cryptocurrency or rival fiat will soon dethrone the dollar \u2013 underpins a **moderate scenario** where crypto coexists with fiat rather than replacing it. In this world, Bitcoin might solidify a role as a digital reserve asset **complementary** to dollars, euros, or gold, but not a wholesale substitute for major currencies. Indeed, even as central banks slowly diversify (e.g. adding some yuan or gold), the consensus is that a *full* replacement of the dollar is unlikely in the foreseeable future\u301031\u2020L60-L68\u3011. This expectation tempers the probability of an extreme crypto-dominant outcome. Still, subtle shifts in the reserve makeup could benefit crypto indirectly. For example, if the dollar\u2019s share slips to ~50% by 2040 (as some forecasts suggest)\u301031\u2020L111-L119\u3011, we may see a more **multipolar currency world** where confidence in any one fiat is lower. In one **extreme bull scenario**, that possibility expands the \u201cpermission space\u201d for Bitcoin or stablecoins to act as a *neutral global reserve* or medium for some transactions. Notably, the World Economic Forum\u2019s vision for 2030 predicted that *multiple reserve currencies will coexist and digital money usage will soar*\u301019\u2020L109-L117\u3011\u301019\u2020L119-L127\u3011. If trust erodes in traditional currencies (due to debt, geopolitics, or inflation), cryptocurrencies could capitalize as alternative stores of value or transactional currencies not tied to any single country. On the other hand, major powers are **actively defending their monetary turf**: over 90% of the world\u2019s central banks are researching or piloting CBDCs as of mid-2020s\u301032\u2020L131-L139\u3011, aiming to offer digital convenience **without ceding control** to private cryptos. This widespread CBDC push suggests a concerted effort to *maintain central bank influence* \u2013 a trend that supports a bear case where governments blunt crypto adoption by offering state digital currencies and enforcing strict regulations on competitors.\n\n## Technological Disruptors: AI Boom, Blockchain Advancements, and Security Risks  \nRapid technological change will be a double-edged sword for crypto\u2019s future. On one side, the synergy between **blockchain and the AI revolution** could significantly boost the crypto ecosystem (bull case). On the other, emerging technologies (from AI superintelligence to quantum computing) could introduce new threats or superior alternatives to current cryptocurrencies (bear case). \n\n**AI and Automation \u2013 Catalysts for Crypto Adoption:** The next 20 years are likely to see an AI-driven economic transformation, with **artificial intelligence permeating industries and daily life**. Public blockchains like Ethereum may become critical infrastructure for this AI-powered world. Recent research speculates that *crypto could be the \u201craison d\u2019etre\u201d for AI*, providing **transparent, immutable ledgers and token incentives** that AI systems require\u301014\u2020L145-L153\u3011\u301014\u2020L172-L180\u3011. In essence, blockchains solve key \u201ccoordination problems\u201d in a decentralized digital environment \u2013 they offer trustless transparency, data integrity, and clear ownership, which could be vital for verifying AI outputs and governing AI systems\u301014\u2020L172-L180\u3011. By 2030, crypto projects enabling AI services (e.g. decentralized computing power, data marketplaces, or AI model verification on-chain) are projected to generate billions in revenue\u301014\u2020L145-L153\u3011. For example, **tokenized compute networks** might let AI developers tap global GPU resources, while smart contracts ensure fair payment \u2013 a model that rewards participants in crypto tokens. This **integration of AI and blockchain** suggests a virtuous cycle in the bull scenario: as AI\u2019s role in the economy explodes, it **drives demand for decentralized networks** to handle identity, micropayments, data validation, and security for AI applications. Blockchain\u2019s properties of immutability and verifiable scarcity may also help tackle issues like AI-generated content ownership and deepfake authentication\u301014\u2020L172-L180\u3011\u301014\u2020L186-L194\u3011. In practical terms, a world with billions of AI-powered devices (IoT, autonomous agents, etc.) might use cryptocurrencies for machine-to-machine payments and to enforce contracts without human intervention. This would expand crypto usage far beyond human investors \u2013 a true *mainstreaming* across the digital economy.\n\n**Technological Threats \u2013 From Quantum to Enhanced Control:** Conversely, technology could undermine the crypto thesis if it develops in unfavorable ways. A prime concern is **quantum computing**, which within 10\u201320 years may become powerful enough to break current cryptographic algorithms. Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on encryption (e.g. elliptic-curve digital signatures) to secure wallets and transactions. If a sufficiently advanced quantum computer (\u201cQ-day\u201d) arrives by the 2030s without mitigation, it could *theoretically crack private keys* and undermine blockchain security\u301033\u2020L15-L18\u3011\u301035\u2020L224-L234\u3011. Experts note that as of 2025 we are *likely a decade or more away* from that level of quantum capability, and achieving thousands of error-corrected qubits is a major hurdle\u301035\u2020L224-L233\u3011\u301035\u2020L249-L258\u3011. Nonetheless, the **long-term threat is real** \u2013 government and industry groups are already working on \u201cpost-quantum\u201d cryptography, urging the crypto industry to be **quantum-ready by 2030** as a precaution\u301035\u2020L293-L301\u3011. In a bear scenario, if blockchain networks fail to upgrade in time or if an unexpected quantum breakthrough occurs, a loss of confidence in crypto security could be devastating. More likely, though, the crypto community will implement quantum-resistant algorithms well before catastrophe, limiting this to a manageable risk rather than an existential one. \n\nAnother tech-driven bear factor could be **AI itself if misused against crypto**. Highly sophisticated AI could make cyberattacks (like phishing for private keys or writing malware to exploit smart contracts) more effective, potentially eroding trust in the ecosystem. It might also enable **mass surveillance and financial controls** that diminish the relative appeal of decentralized systems. For example, advanced AI combined with CBDCs could give governments fine-grained control over transactions (flagging or blocking undesirable activity instantly). If this technology is effective and public backlash is muted, many users might accept state-managed digital money over crypto, especially if it\u2019s more user-friendly. Indeed, the programmability of CBDCs can be used in *dystopian* ways (e.g. China testing expiration dates on digital yuan to force spending)\u301032\u2020L114-L122\u3011\u301032\u2020L160-L168\u3011, but also in \u201cbenevolent\u201d ways (like automating stimulus payments in crises)\u301032\u2020L149-L158\u3011. Should citizens prioritize convenience and government assurances over privacy, crypto could struggle to gain broad adoption \u2013 a scenario where technology empowers the existing financial order to **absorb or outcompete crypto innovations**.\n\nFinally, consider **blockchain technology\u2019s own evolution**. Over the next 20 years, we expect major improvements in scalability (through layer-2 networks, sharding, etc.), privacy features, and interoperability. This is bullish for leading platforms like Ethereum \u2013 unless a *new technology leapfrogs blockchain entirely*. It\u2019s hard to envision a system that replicates the core advantages of decentralized ledgers while being strictly superior in performance **and** controlled by incumbents. However, one could imagine large tech or financial consortia creating permissioned distributed ledgers that offer 90% of blockchain\u2019s functionality but in a regulated framework, drawing users who prefer familiarity and legal protections. If Ethereum and other public chains fail to scale affordably or suffer repeated exploits, users might migrate to these semi-centralized networks (or to competing layer-1s), diluting the dominance of today\u2019s crypto incumbents. \n\nIn summary, the **rise of AI and tech can bolster crypto\u2019s case** by increasing the need for decentralized trust and native internet value, but it also introduces new risks (quantum, AI-driven attacks) and alternatives (CBDCs, private networks). The net effect will depend on whether the crypto sector can continue to innovate and address its challenges in tandem with technological progress.\n\n## Bull Case Scenario: Crypto Revolution and Mainstream Integration  \nIn the bullish scenario, the 2020s and 2030s bring about a **cryptocurrency revolution** that firmly embeds Bitcoin, Ethereum, and select other digital assets into the fabric of the global economy. This future isn\u2019t necessarily one where fiat currencies disappear, but one where crypto achieves **mass adoption and institutional legitimacy** at multiple levels. Below are the key features of this bull case:\n\n- **Macroeconomic Drivers (Store-of-Value and Reserve Adoption):** In this scenario, loose monetary policies and periodic crises steadily erode faith in traditional money, leading investors and even governments to increasingly favor crypto as a hedge. Bitcoin, with its **provably finite supply**, becomes widely regarded as \u201cdigital gold 2.0\u201d \u2013 a reliable store-of-value in an era of money printing. Unlike fiat, its supply can\u2019t be expanded *indefinitely*, a trait that gains appeal if inflationary episodes occur\u30108\u2020L1040-L1047\u3011. Over time, more institutional investors add Bitcoin to their portfolios for diversification and as \u201chard currency\u201d insurance. By the early 2030s, spot Bitcoin ETFs and regulated custody solutions are ubiquitous, making BTC exposure as common as owning real estate or commodities. In fact, institutional adoption is already rising \u2013 a 2025 survey found **86% of institutional investors had exposure or intended to allocate to digital assets**\u301025\u2020L113-L121\u3011. This trend accelerates such that by 2040, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and corporate treasuries hold meaningful Bitcoin positions as a hedge against fiat weakness and as an uncorrelated asset. ARK Investment Management projects that *nation-state treasuries and corporations will eventually diversify into Bitcoin*, adding to its demand base\u30101\u2020L203-L210\u3011. We could even see a **Bitcoin strategic reserve** in a few smaller nations (as pioneered by El Salvador) or a major economy issuing a digital bond backed partly by Bitcoin reserves. In the bull case, this positive feedback loop culminates in Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization reaching many trillions of dollars, potentially rivaling gold\u2019s, and a price per coin in the high six or seven figures (some analysts\u2019 2030 targets range from ~$300K to $1M+\u30102\u2020L1-L9\u3011). While price is not our focus, it reflects adoption; in this future, Bitcoin would be a globally recognized asset class.\n\n- **Global Currency Role and Financial System Integration:** Unlike today, crypto in this scenario is not just for speculation \u2013 it enjoys **practical use and integration** in the financial system. Internationally, Bitcoin and Ethereum-based stablecoins begin to serve as **intermediary currencies** in trade and remittances, especially in regions with unstable fiat currencies. For instance, imagine importers in an emerging market using a dollar stablecoin on Ethereum or Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network to settle invoices in minutes, sidestepping the SWIFT system. This becomes plausible as regulatory clarity improves and transaction costs fall. If the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance recedes to a more multipolar system (with a stronger euro, yuan, etc.), some actors may prefer truly neutral payment media \u2013 giving Bitcoin or decentralized stablecoins a niche in facilitating trade between countries lacking mutual trust. By 2045, it\u2019s conceivable that a **basket of cryptocurrencies** (including Bitcoin and major stablecoins) accounts for a noticeable share of global forex transactions and reserves, alongside traditional currencies. This aligns with one think-tank\u2019s \u201cinternational monetary anarchy\u201d scenario, where failures of central-bank money lead **private cryptocurrencies to take on much larger roles in national and international transactions**\u301020\u2020L2415-L2423\u3011\u301020\u2020L2423-L2431\u3011. In that extreme vision, non-state units of account become common for pricing goods and services, and both public and private crypto-based payment networks flourish. Even if reality falls short of that anarchic extreme, the bull case envisions crypto *complementing* fiat: e.g. central banks might hold a small percentage of Bitcoin in reserves (following the idea that if you can\u2019t beat digital gold, you join it), and consumers might regularly use stablecoins for everyday payments, with crypto rails operating under the hood of banking apps.\n\n- **Ethereum and the Web3 Boom:** Ethereum, often described as the \u201cworld computer,\u201d is at the heart of the bull case as the infrastructure for a decentralized internet of value. Over 20 years, Ethereum overcomes current scalability limits, making transactions fast and fees negligible. This unlocks a **wave of innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), digital identity, gaming, and tokenized real-world assets**. By the mid-2030s, many financial services have migrated to smart contract platforms: lending, borrowing, and trading can be done peer-to-peer without traditional banks, lowering costs for users. Ethereum\u2019s network becomes a **global settlement layer** for everything from insurance contracts to supply chain management tokens. Corporations and governments may use Ethereum (or interoperable public chains) to issue digital bonds, maintain registries, and execute transparent spending programs. Crucially, Ethereum\u2019s native asset, ETH, benefits from this activity. Since \u201c**ETH must be purchased to utilize Ethereum**\u201d services, widespread network usage drives continuous demand for ETH\u301029\u2020L219-L227\u3011. Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s post-2022 shift to proof-of-stake and the introduction of fee burning (EIP-1559) make ETH a deflationary or yield-bearing asset when network usage is high. In the bull scenario, Ethereum\u2019s economics are extremely attractive: **ETH is \u201cDigital Oil\u201d fueling online applications and a \u201cYield-Bearing Commodity\u201d** because holders can stake it to earn rewards for securing the network\u301029\u2020L156-L164\u3011. VanEck Research describes ETH as having no parallel in traditional finance \u2013 it can function simultaneously as programmable money, a productive asset generating cashflow (via staking yields and burned fees), and even as an \u201cInternet Reserve Currency\u201d underpinning a $ trillion ecosystem of tokens and apps\u301029\u2020L156-L164\u3011\u301029\u2020L165-L168\u3011. By 2040, ETH could be considered a sort of **digital GDP proxy** \u2013 its value tied to the economic activity on a decentralized internet. Price targets in a bull case reflect exponential growth: some analyses foresee ETH potentially exceeding five digits (>$100k) if it captures major chunks of global finance and tech revenue by 2030-2040\u301027\u2020L127-L136\u3011\u301027\u2020L137-L144\u3011. More important than price, Ethereum\u2019s success would mean everyday users interact with blockchain applications (often without even realizing, as friendly interfaces abstract away complexity) \u2013 for example, using a Web3 social network where your profile data is an NFT you control, or playing games where in-game items are tradable on Ethereum\u2019s rails. This **Web3 boom** would extend ownership and monetization to users in unprecedented ways, fulfilling the crypto promise of democratizing finance and the web.\n\n- **Technology and AI Tailwinds:** In the bull narrative, technology trends amplify crypto\u2019s advantages. The AI explosion drives more business on-chain (for reasons discussed earlier), and **crypto becomes indispensable for AI services** \u2013 e.g. AI agents might use micro-payments in crypto to buy data or computational tasks from each other securely. Blockchain\u2019s transparency also helps audit AI decisions, which is crucial in a world where AI is making financial and legal judgements. Additionally, **IoT devices** may commonly use cryptographic tokens to autonomously transact (paying for electricity, bandwidth, etc.), creating an economy of devices with Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network or Ethereum\u2019s layer-2s as the monetary language. By 2045, one could imagine billions of machine wallets conducting high-volume, low-value transactions far beyond human scales \u2013 something only feasible via decentralized cryptocurrencies. Another tech tailwind is the maturation of **layer-2 scaling and interoperability**. Users won\u2019t need to know which blockchain they\u2019re on; value moves seamlessly across chains and traditional systems. For instance, your digital yuan and your USDC stablecoin and your ether can all be exchanged in seconds for one another through decentralized liquidity networks, making currency exchange (and by extension, capital flows) more efficient and less dollar-centric. \n\n- **Government and Regulatory Environment:** Surprisingly, even regulators could play a constructive role in this bull scenario. Faced with innovation, many governments choose to **integrate and regulate crypto rather than ban it**. Clear legal frameworks for crypto-assets, consumer protections, and perhaps moderate taxation give traditional institutions the confidence to participate. Major economies might approve bank custody of crypto, issue tokenized government bonds, or even allow paying taxes in cryptocurrency. Some forward-looking central banks might launch **crypto-friendly CBDCs** interoperable with public blockchains, combining the trust of state money with the innovation of DeFi. (For example, a digital dollar that can be used in Ethereum smart contracts could marry fiat stability with crypto efficiency.) In this environment, outright bans are rare outside of authoritarian regimes. Instead, authorities focus on mitigating risks (KYC/AML compliance via privacy-protecting protocols, etc.) while **embracing the economic potential** of crypto. Notably, even China\u2019s stance could soften if the e-CNY finds a way to coexist with controlled use of public chains. A hint of this came in 2023\u20132024 when Hong Kong (with Beijing\u2019s tacit approval) moved to legalize retail crypto trading, suggesting China might tolerate crypto innovation in certain contexts to remain competitive. Overall, by 2040, crypto in the bull case is as normal as the internet \u2013 it\u2019s regulated but thriving, much like e-commerce eventually gained trust and oversight in the 2000s.\n\n- **Outcomes for Key Players:** **Bitcoin** emerges as a kind of supra-national asset \u2013 **\u201cdigital gold\u201d and reserve 2.0** \u2013 held by institutions and individuals as a long-term store of wealth. It may not replace everyday cash (few people buy coffee with Bitcoin in 2040, just as few buy it with gold today), but it sits in the background as a bedrock of value and a go-to hedge in crises. Its price, while volatile, tends to appreciate as adoption and scarce supply collide. **Ethereum** in this scenario could arguably be even more impactful: it\u2019s the **global settlement layer for Web3**, hosting thousands of applications and tokens that permeate entertainment, finance, and commerce. Ethereum-based networks might handle *trillions of dollars in daily transactions* (much as Visa plus Fedwire do today, but in a decentralized manner). ETH holders benefit from both the utility (paying for gas in all these transactions) and the monetary policy (with high activity causing substantial ETH burn, making ETH deflationary and valuable). **China\u2019s e-CNY** also succeeds on its own terms in this bull world \u2013 it becomes the **first major CBDC** with wide domestic use (perhaps nearly replacing cash in China by 2040) and gains some international foothold (e.g. adopted by Belt & Road partner countries for bilateral trade). However, instead of crushing other cryptos, the e-CNY\u2019s success simply validates the concept of digital currency. It coexists with decentralized coins: for instance, a Chinese exporter might accept e-CNY from an African importer, then convert some to Bitcoin as a long-term reserve. The presence of a dominant digital yuan might *diminish* demand for crypto within China (bearish for local crypto use), but globally it contributes to the fragmentation that allows crypto to find niches. Essentially, the bull scenario is not **Crypto *versus* Governments** \u2013 it\u2019s **Crypto *alongside* Governments**, reshaping finance in a way that even traditional players adapt to. \n\nIn combination, these factors paint a bullish future where crypto technologies are as commonplace and revolutionary as the internet, *increasing global economic freedom and efficiency*. Probabilistically, this scenario is **plausible but not the base case** \u2013 perhaps a 20\u201330% chance by 2045, given significant hurdles remain. It would require favorable outcomes on many fronts: prudent regulation, tech breakthroughs, and some luck in avoiding catastrophic bugs or attacks. Yet, as we\u2019ve seen with the rapid rise of the internet and mobile phones, **20 years can transform nascent tech into global infrastructure**. Crypto\u2019s bull case bets on a similar trajectory of innovation and adoption.\n\n## Bear Case Scenario: Crypto Collapse or Marginalization  \nTurning to the bear case, we explore a scenario in which cryptocurrencies fail to fulfill their disruptive promise and instead become a marginal or strictly controlled part of the financial system. In this future, the headwinds \u2013 regulatory crackdowns, technological challenges, and lack of use cases \u2013 outweigh the tailwinds, resulting in stagnation or even collapse of major crypto assets. Key elements of the bear case include:\n\n- **Aggressive Regulation and Bans:** The single biggest threat in this scenario is a **global wave of regulatory repression** against decentralized crypto. Motivated by concerns over financial stability, illicit activity, and loss of monetary control, governments (especially of major economies) take coordinated actions to constrain crypto usage. This might be triggered by a crisis \u2013 for example, if a future financial panic is blamed (rightly or wrongly) on crypto market instability, regulators could respond with heavy-handed measures. In the bear scenario, one possibility is that central banks introduce **CBDCs that effectively replace cash and bank deposits**, and simultaneously outlaw or severely limit interactions between these CBDCs and crypto. An extreme case was posited by analysts: *if a country fully converts its monetary system to a CBDC, it could outright ban using the CBDC to buy crypto*\u301032\u2020L221-L228\u3011. We can imagine, say, the U.S. launching a \u201cdigital dollar\u201d and making it illegal to exchange that digital dollar for Bitcoin on regulated platforms, under the pretext of preventing capital flight or money laundering. Such policies would dry up liquidity and access, causing crypto prices to plummet and usage to become clandestine. China\u2019s playbook offers a template: by 2021, China had already banned crypto exchanges and mining domestically, driving much activity underground or overseas. In a broad bear scenario, other jurisdictions follow suit \u2013 **crypto becomes a financial pariah** akin to the black market. The FREOPP white paper on potential U.S. fiscal crisis scenarios actually identified a restrictive, anti-Bitcoin crackdown as the *most probable government response* if the dollar were in free-fall\u301017\u2020L199-L207\u3011. Under this outcome, measures could include \u201cVenezuela-style\u201d controls: frozen bank accounts for crypto-related transactions, punitive taxation on crypto holdings, and pervasive surveillance to snuff out peer-to-peer usage\u301017\u2020L199-L207\u3011. Even absent a dramatic trigger, incremental regulation can squeeze crypto over time: high capital requirements and legal uncertainties could discourage banks and institutional investors from touching crypto, securities laws might stifle DeFi and token innovation (e.g. the SEC treating most tokens as illegal securities in the U.S.), and stringent KYC rules could eliminate the anonymity that attracts certain users. If the **regulatory vise tightens globally**, many potential users might simply opt out of crypto for fear of legal consequences or lack of convenience, leaving only a hardcore group of enthusiasts transacting in the shadows. This \u201ccompliance squeeze\u201d is a very plausible component of the bear case, as evidenced by calls from some experts to ban crypto entirely after episodes like the FTX collapse in 2022\u30108\u2020L1140-L1148\u3011.\n\n- **Central Bank Digital Currencies Eclipse Crypto:** Alongside regulation, the rise of CBDCs can dilute many of crypto\u2019s value propositions. In a future where **CBDCs are ubiquitous and well-implemented**, average consumers might have little reason to use cryptocurrencies. Imagine in 2035 you have a Federal Reserve digital wallet that offers instant, feeless payments, accepted everywhere, and even yields some interest \u2013 most people would find that easier than dealing with volatile, complicated crypto wallets. CBDCs are by design **stable (1:1 with fiat), convenient, and integrated into official financial systems**\u301032\u2020L139-L147\u3011. They also can address certain inefficiencies crypto targets: for example, cross-border payments could become faster and cheaper if multiple CBDCs interoperate (projects like mBridge hint at that)\u301026\u2020L57-L64\u3011. In the bear scenario, central banks succeed in co-opting the innovations of crypto \u2013 digitalizing money \u2013 while maintaining control. This leaves decentralized crypto with a *diminished raison d\u2019\u00eatre* for the average user. Why use Bitcoin for remittances if your digital dollar and digital euro do the job instantly? Furthermore, governments could specifically design CBDCs to edge out crypto platforms. Recall that China\u2019s e-CNY is intended to disintermediate private payment apps\u301032\u2020L191-L199\u3011; a similar ethos could apply to displacing crypto exchanges or stablecoins. If authorities program CBDCs to be incompatible with known crypto addresses or impose caps on converting to crypto, it becomes technically difficult to even get funds into the crypto ecosystem. **Importantly, CBDCs also neutralize the \u201cpayments use case\u201d of crypto** by offering equal or better performance. While crypto purists value censorship-resistance and privacy, the mass of users might prefer the legal certainty and recourse that comes with state money. Over 20 years, as younger, more tech-savvy generations grow up with CBDCs as the norm, the novelty of independent cryptocurrencies could wane. The Aberdeen analysis points out a crucial dynamic: CBDCs could either *stifle crypto* by direct competition and crackdowns, or inadvertently *drive people toward crypto* if they overreach on surveillance\u301032\u2020L221-L228\u3011\u301032\u2020L230-L238\u3011. In the bear scenario, assume the former \u2013 that most people accept the trade-off of privacy for convenience, and only a minority flees to Bitcoin for ideological reasons. Thus, by 2045, crypto might be relegated to a **small insurgent financial network** used by privacy advocates, dissidents in authoritarian states, and cybercriminals \u2013 much as early critics characterized it.\n\n- **Persistent Volatility and Trust Issues:** Another pillar of the bear case is that cryptocurrencies simply never overcome their **inherent volatility and trust deficits**, preventing broad adoption as currency or long-term investments. Even as of mid-2020s, the price of Bitcoin and Ether swings wildly, limiting their usefulness for everyday transactions\u30108\u2020L1053-L1061\u3011. In a bearish future, this volatility could continue (or worsen) as speculative fervor cycles boom and bust. If no stable equilibrium of value is found, merchants and consumers won\u2019t price goods in BTC or ETH, and lenders won\u2019t want to write contracts in them. Crypto would remain **primarily a casino** \u2013 reinforcing regulators\u2019 arguments that it lacks fundamental value. Additionally, the series of **scandals and failures** that have plagued the industry might persist, eroding public confidence. The collapse of exchanges like FTX in 2022, hacks draining DeFi protocols, and rampant frauds (Ponzi schemes, rug pulls) have already hurt crypto\u2019s reputation\u30108\u2020L1140-L1148\u3011. In a bear scenario, despite more maturity, such incidents keep happening due to the difficulty of securing complex code and the lack of consumer protections on decentralized platforms. Each major loss event would drive more people away, convincing them crypto is not worth the risk. By 2040, if the average person\u2019s perception of crypto is that of a **scam-ridden Wild West**, adoption beyond a niche will stall. The lack of trust could become self-fulfilling: low adoption means crypto doesn\u2019t achieve the network effects needed to stabilize, and thus remains volatile and marginal \u2013 a vicious cycle.\n\n- **Technological Shortcomings and Competition:** Suppose the much-hyped technical improvements for crypto either *don\u2019t arrive on time* or are *insufficient*. Ethereum, for example, faces competition from newer blockchains boasting higher throughput and lower fees. It\u2019s possible that by 2030, Ethereum loses relevance to some next-generation protocol (or to dozens of specialized chains that fragment the developer community). If Ethereum\u2019s dominance fades, the whole DeFi and Web3 narrative might lose momentum, as no single platform achieves the \u201ccritical mass\u201d to truly challenge Web2 giants. Even if technical solutions come, they might introduce new complexities. For instance, sharded or layer-2 networks could make the user experience confusing (with funds stuck in various bridges, etc.), deterring non-experts. In the bear case, blockchains struggle to compete with Big Tech\u2019s centralized systems that are incredibly user-friendly and integrated. A company like Google or Amazon could offer finance apps with near-zero fees and instant settlement by internally managing databases \u2013 essentially replicating the surface benefits of crypto (speed, cost) without decentralization. Most users might not care about decentralization if the service is \u201cgood enough\u201d and backed by a trusted brand. Thus, crypto\u2019s **value proposition diminishes in the face of centralized tech advancements**. Consider also **energy and environmental concerns**: if Bitcoin continues to rely on proof-of-work mining and there\u2019s a strong global push for carbon reduction, it could face bans or divestment due to its energy consumption. Although miners are moving to renewables in part, public perception could turn against \u201cwasteful\u201d crypto mining, further reducing support. \n\n- **Lack of Real Economic Linkage:** In this bearish world, cryptocurrencies fail to create strong links to the real economy. Tokenization of assets doesn\u2019t take off due to legal barriers \u2013 for example, maybe laws continue to restrict on-chain stocks or property deeds, so the traditional system remains dominant. DeFi protocols may remain confined to trading *other crypto assets* and not real-world assets, making them largely self-referential. Without ties to real economic productivity, crypto\u2019s market becomes a closed loop that can implode if new money stops coming in. The scenario of *cryptocurrencies remaining a speculative side-show* is captured by one academic scenario where **\u201ccryptocurrencies remain marginalized, serving only as volatile assets for speculators,\u201d while the international monetary system continues to reinforce U.S. dollar dominance**\u301021\u2020L1-L4\u3011. In other words, the world in 2040 might not look dramatically different from today\u2019s \u2013 the dollar still king, banks and central banks firmly in control, and crypto a footnote (perhaps analogous to how penny stocks or offshore gambling exist, but in the periphery).\n\n- **Outcomes for Key Players:** In the bear case, **Bitcoin** fails to secure the \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative beyond a devoted cadre. Its price might languish or drift downward in real terms, reflecting diminishing liquidity and interest. It could still exist \u2013 Bitcoin has a resilient core community \u2013 but perhaps with a market cap a fraction of what it could have been (and well below major fiat M2 money supplies). If governments aggressively restrict on-ramps, Bitcoin may trade on black markets at a liquidity discount. **Ethereum** and the broader smart contract sector could similarly stagnate. Maybe Ethereum becomes the Myspace of blockchains \u2013 important in history but overtaken by other solutions or squeezed by regulation that deems most of its tokens as illegal securities. In a harsh regulatory climate, U.S. authorities, for instance, might bar banks from interacting with Ethereum-based networks at all, which would be crippling. DeFi might die on the vine if every on/off ramp is cut and if no new users can legally participate. Some developers could move to more permissible jurisdictions, but global coordination (through bodies like the FATF or IMF) might limit regulatory arbitrage. As for **China\u2019s e-CNY**, in this scenario it *thrives domestically* and perhaps in a few aligned countries \u2013 but its success comes at crypto\u2019s expense. Chinese citizens, who might have been a huge source of crypto demand, are fully captive to the digital yuan system instead. Other major central banks also roll out CBDCs, so the window for private crypto to fill a payments niche closes. One could imagine a future where using Bitcoin is as rare as using gold coin for payment: technically possible but exceedingly unusual and even suspect. It\u2019s worth noting that even in a bear scenario, blockchain technology might still find some adoption \u2013 but likely in heavily permissioned, non-public ways (e.g. banks using private ledgers among themselves, which doesn\u2019t benefit public crypto assets). \n\n- **Social and Political Backlash:** A subtle factor that could drive the bear case is socio-political sentiment. If cryptocurrencies are perceived as tools that mainly benefit the wealthy or criminals, they will lose public support. Already, data shows Bitcoin ownership is quite concentrated \u2013 roughly **1% of Bitcoin addresses control a large majority of the supply** (one report noted ~87% of all Bitcoin is held by the top 1% of holders)\u301017\u2020L221-L230\u3011. If this inequality persists or worsens, it could become a political flashpoint (\u201cthe rich get richer off crypto while others get scammed\u201d). Democracies might not tolerate a financial system that appears to create a new plutocracy, giving impetus to crack down or heavily tax crypto holdings\u301017\u2020L221-L230\u3011. Environmental concerns could likewise turn public opinion against proof-of-work coins if they\u2019re seen as threatening climate goals\u30108\u2020L1123-L1131\u3011. In short, the bear case might be cheered on by a public narrative that *cryptocurrency is a failed experiment \u2013 unstable, used by bad actors, and unnecessary in a well-run financial system*. \n\nIn probability terms, the bear scenario could be assigned perhaps a **20%\u201330% chance** as well (some pessimists might say higher). It effectively materializes if multiple major governments independently decide \u201cno thanks\u201d to crypto, or if one catastrophic event (like a quantum hack or a massive fraud crashing markets) irreparably tarnishes the industry. It\u2019s not the most likely scenario given that outright global bans are hard to coordinate and technology often finds a way to persist. However, elements of the bear case \u2013 particularly **continued regulatory pressure and slow adoption** \u2013 might occur even without an apocalypse, yielding a slower, fizzling outcome rather than a dramatic crash.\n\n## Most Likely Scenario: Moderate Coexistence and Gradual Integration  \nBetween the extremes of the roaring bull and crushing bear, the **most probable outcome** for the next 20 years is a middle path: cryptocurrencies gradually integrate into the global system without supplanting it. In this moderate scenario, we\u2019d see: \n\n- **Coexistence with Fiat:** Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to grow in usage and value but *alongside* traditional currencies, not in replacement of them. The U.S. dollar likely **maintains its reserve dominance through 2045** (analysts widely expect it to remain on top for decades\u301031\u2020L60-L68\u3011), meaning crypto will not overthrow the dollar\u2019s role in trade or central bank reserves. Instead, crypto finds a niche as a **complementary asset class**. Bitcoin might settle into a role akin to a global risk asset (some mix of digital gold and a tech commodity), and its price could stabilize relative to the wild swings of the early days, especially if broad institutional ownership smooths out volatility. But it would still be far too volatile to replace national currencies or to be used for everyday pricing of goods \u2013 so fiat remains the unit of account for economies. Governments, by and large, do not adopt Bitcoin as legal tender (El Salvador and a few outliers aside), but neither do they universally ban it. Moderate regulation brings crypto **into the regulatory perimeter**: for instance, crypto exchanges operate under bank-like rules, large transactions are monitored for AML, and taxable events are enforced. This limits some of crypto\u2019s anarchic appeal but makes it more palatable to mainstream users and institutions. \n\n- **Selective Adoption of Technology:** Many **blockchain innovations get absorbed into the existing financial infrastructure**. For example, central banks and major banks use distributed ledger tech for specific purposes (settling interbank transactions faster, issuing bonds, etc.), but they might use private or permissioned versions. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities could be harnessed in regulated environments \u2013 e.g. stock exchanges might adopt smart contracts for trade settlement, but the tokens traded are digital representations of stocks (not wild new ICO tokens). Essentially, the legacy system upgrades itself by cherry-picking the best ideas from crypto, reducing the need for a wholesale crypto takeover. Decentralized finance likely coexists with centralized finance: some people will get loans from a DeFi protocol, but many will still use their local bank or a fintech app that perhaps *uses DeFi behind the scenes without the user knowing*. \n\n- **Stablecoins and CBDCs:** A key bridging role may be played by **stablecoins**, which are crypto tokens pegged to fiat. In a moderate scenario, fiat-backed stablecoins (like USDC or successors) thrive under regulation, becoming widely used for digital payments, remittances, and as collateral in DeFi. They could act as the **digital glue** between traditional money and crypto \u2013 for instance, a consumer might hold a CBDC in a government wallet but also use a private USD stablecoin on a different blockchain for specific applications. Regulators might support well-audited stablecoins because they reinforce their fiat\u2019s usage (indeed, dollar stablecoins arguably extend dollar dominance into crypto realms). At the same time, **CBDCs will be rolled out by many countries by 2040**, but they will often coexist with cash and other forms of money rather than fully replace them\u301032\u2020L179-L187\u3011. For example, the U.S. could introduce a digital dollar mainly for bank-to-bank settlement or as an opt-in payment method, but keep cash and bank deposits as is, to avoid upsetting the financial system. In this case, CBDCs don\u2019t completely cannibalize the crypto market; instead, both evolve with some overlaps. A Bank of England report has even suggested a model where CBDC and cash coexist, and privacy is considered in design\u301032\u2020L177-L185\u3011\u301032\u2020L179-L187\u3011 \u2013 indicating moderate implementations rather than extremes. \n\n- **Controlled Growth of Crypto Markets:** By 2045, crypto market capitalization might grow significantly from today (reflecting adoption and inflation), but it could remain a *fraction of global equity or bond markets*. For instance, a scenario might be Bitcoin reaching, say, $200k\u2013$500k per coin (making it a multi-trillion asset, comparable to gold\u2019s valuation) and Ethereum in the high five figures, but not an outright replacement for major currencies. These assets could be part of many investment portfolios (much like gold or tech stocks are), yet not something that completely dominates finance. Global finance in 2045 might still be mostly in fiat terms, but crypto could account for perhaps 5\u201310% of global investable assets. That would be a huge growth from today, but still not world-changing dominance. \n\n- **Use Cases Maturing:** In the moderate outlook, certain crypto use cases prove genuinely useful and stick around. **Cross-border payments** is a likely one \u2013 even the IMF and World Bank have acknowledged crypto can reduce remittance costs. By 2040, sending money abroad via crypto rails could be mainstream, possibly even facilitated by banks (e.g. you go to Bank of America and they use XRP or a stablecoin under the hood to send money to a bank in Thailand, but you barely notice). **Tokenization** of some assets happens \u2013 perhaps niche real estate funds, art, or smaller company stocks get tokenized to improve liquidity. **NFTs** evolve beyond art into things like credentials, event tickets, or digital identity verification, but these aren\u2019t shaking nation-states, just improving certain markets. **DeFi** might integrate with TradFi (traditional finance) \u2013 you could have your brokerage offer a yield product that actually farms a DeFi protocol, again abstracted away. \n\n- **Politics and Society:** Public opinion on crypto in this scenario is mixed but not overly polarized. Crypto is no longer seen as a haven solely for criminals (due to better oversight), but it\u2019s also not seen as a cure-all. It\u2019s just another part of the financial landscape, much like derivatives or tech startups \u2013 with benefits and risks to manage. Governments accept that while they lost a bit of control (private money exists in parallel), they didn\u2019t lose the war: they still levy taxes in fiat, still control monetary policy largely (especially if stablecoins are regulated to hold reserves 1:1, central banks indirectly still influence even those), and can enforce laws on major crypto businesses. In authoritarian regimes, crypto remains underground but provides a lifeline for some (e.g. people in sanctioned countries using Bitcoin to bypass restrictions, as is already happening in places like Iran or North Korea)\u30108\u2020L1031-L1040\u3011\u30108\u2020L1117-L1124\u3011. In democratic regimes, crypto might even gain some political lobby power \u2013 by 2040 there could be \u201cBlockchain Caucuses\u201d in parliaments ensuring the industry isn\u2019t unfairly quashed, reflecting its moderate entrenchment.\n\nIn essence, the moderate scenario suggests **crypto becomes an important, but not dominant, piece of the global economy**. It is akin to the role of **alternative investments** today \u2013 significant for those who want them, but largely invisible to someone buying groceries or earning a salary (which still happen in local currency). Probabilistically, this scenario is the **base case (perhaps ~50\u201360% likelihood)** given current trajectories: it acknowledges crypto\u2019s innovative appeal and growth, but also the reality of state power and economic inertia. \n\n## Probabilistic Forecast and Conclusion  \nConsidering the above scenarios, we can assign rough subjective probabilities to each by 2045:\n\n- **Bull Case (Crypto Revolution): ~20% Probability.** This is the scenario of dramatic crypto adoption \u2013 Bitcoin as a major reserve asset, Ethereum/Web3 powering a decentralized economy, and a real challenge to fiat currencies\u2019 supremacy. While not impossible, it faces significant obstacles (policy pushback, technological risk). It would likely require a series of favorable breaks \u2013 possibly including a mishandling of fiat (e.g. high inflation) that drives people to crypto **and** a cooperative regulatory stance that allows innovation to flourish. The bull case is a world of much greater financial democratization and perhaps upheaval of power structures, which is ambitious but not guaranteed. As a frame of reference, some optimistic projections like ARK Invest\u2019s bull scenario see Bitcoin hitting **$1\u20131.5 million** by 2030 and continuing upward\u30102\u2020L1-L9\u3011, implying a future where crypto\u2019s market cap rivals major asset classes. This would be transformative.\n\n- **Bear Case (Crypto Marginalized): ~20% Probability.** This scenario entails severe suppression or a fizzle-out of crypto. It could occur via coordinated regulation (for example, the **G20 agreeing on harsh crypto rules** after a series of crises) or due to a fatal loss of confidence (say a quantum hack in 2030 that steals a large amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum, irreparably damaging trust). Signs that this path is materializing would include multiple major countries banning crypto outright, sustained price declines with no recovery, and a lack of new users beyond a core. While elements of this are already seen in certain countries (China\u2019s ban, for one), a worldwide and lasting marginalization is harder to ensure \u2013 technology often finds cracks to slip through. Still, the bear case cannot be ruled out, especially if **CBDCs become very appealing and governments choose the stick over the carrot** in handling crypto. The historical analogy might be how private banknotes or local currencies largely died out once strong national currencies and banking laws took hold \u2013 crypto could face a similar fate under unyielding state pressure.\n\n- **Base Case (Moderate Coexistence): ~60% Probability.** The most likely outcome is a middle ground where crypto neither conquers nor dies. It becomes somewhat **mainstream as an asset class** (similar to how venture capital or commodities are \u2013 important but not running the entire economy), and its technology influences the broader system. Major powers maintain control over monetary policy; the U.S. dollar likely still accounts for over 50% of global reserves in 2040 (perhaps slightly less than today but not dramatically changed)\u301031\u2020L111-L119\u3011. Crypto\u2019s total market might grow, but in a tempered way, and volatility gradually lessens as the market matures and is more regulated. In scenario planning terms, this is the \u201c**status quo adjusted for innovation**\u201d outcome \u2013 akin to how the internet became pervasive but didn\u2019t eliminate governments or existing currencies (rather, governments adapted to it). Evidence for this trajectory can be seen in how regulators are gradually crafting rules (e.g. many countries implementing crypto exchange registration, stablecoin guidelines) rather than outright banning, indicating an accommodation stance. Also, many large financial institutions are cautiously entering the space (offering custody, research, etc.), which suggests crypto is being absorbed, not eradicated. The Council on Foreign Relations notes that while crypto presents challenges, many governments have so far taken a limited or hands-off approach, and are now starting to regulate more seriously\u30108\u2020L1149-L1152\u3011 \u2013 implying integration into the existing order.\n\nIn conclusion, the next 20 years for cryptocurrency will likely see **significant growth and innovation tempered by oversight and competition**. Monetary policies in the U.S., China, and elsewhere will heavily influence whether crypto\u2019s role expands as a hedge against fiat mismanagement or is contained as a speculative sideline. The global economic system\u2019s trajectory \u2013 whether it remains dollar-centric or shifts to a multipolar/more digital paradigm \u2013 will set the stage for how much space crypto can occupy. Technological advancements, from AI to quantum computing, add further uncertainty: they could either bolster the utility of crypto networks or present new threats to their security and comparative advantage. \n\nA prudent forecast is that **Bitcoin and Ethereum will still be with us in 2045**, likely with higher values and deeper integration than today, but *not* replacing national currencies. Bitcoin may serve as a recognized store of value (held by many but not used for everyday spending), and Ethereum-based networks might underlie many applications (though users might not always realize when they\u2019re using blockchain). **China\u2019s e-CNY** will probably be a success domestically and could inspire other nations to roll out CBDCs, yet these state coins will aim to *complement or reinforce* existing fiat frameworks rather than adopt crypto\u2019s open ethos. In fact, the spread of CBDCs could either stifle private crypto or, if implemented in an authoritarian manner, unintentionally drive more people globally to seek refuge in decentralized currencies\u301032\u2020L230-L238\u3011. \n\nTo navigate these possibilities, scenario analysis is valuable. If one hears that multiple governments are banning crypto conversions or that a major technical flaw was found in cryptographic algorithms, it would tilt the odds sharply toward the **bear case**. Conversely, if inflation surges or a financial crisis undermines faith in central banks (without draconian crackdowns following), or if a killer app of blockchain emerges that billions use, the needle moves toward the **bull case**. \n\nAs of now (mid-2025), the trajectory appears to be **moderate growth with increasing regulation** \u2013 a path consistent with the base case. The **crypto bull and bear cases** outlined here serve as guardrails to imagine outcomes if variables change dramatically. While we may not see a full \u201ccrypto utopia\u201d or \u201ccrypto oblivion,\u201d elements of each will likely play out. Crypto is gradually coming of age, and its fate will be determined by a complex interplay of economic policy decisions, technological breakthroughs, and societal choices about the kind of financial system we want in the 21st century.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Council on Foreign Relations \u2013 *The Crypto Question: Bitcoin, Digital Dollars, and the Future of Money*\u30108\u2020L1039-L1047\u3011\u30108\u2020L1117-L1124\u3011  \n- FREOPP White Paper \u2013 *Three Scenarios of a U.S. Fiscal Crisis* (Avik Roy, 2025)\u301017\u2020L182-L190\u3011\u301017\u2020L199-L207\u3011  \n- Genspark/Stanford \u2013 Insights on China\u2019s Digital Yuan and Dollar Dominance (Duffie)\u301025\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301025\u2020L197-L201\u3011  \n- South China Morning Post \u2013 Explainer on China\u2019s e-CNY (2025)\u301026\u2020L53-L60\u3011\u301026\u2020L57-L64\u3011  \n- Al Jazeera \u2013 *\u2018Exorbitant privilege\u2019: USD global dominance* (2025)\u301031\u2020L111-L119\u3011\u301031\u2020L140-L147\u3011  \n- IASS (Potsdam) \u2013 *Future of International Monetary System in 2040* (scenarios)\u301020\u2020L2415-L2423\u3011\u301021\u2020L1-L4\u3011  \n- ARK Invest \u2013 *Bitcoin Price Target 2030* (Big Ideas 2025 report)\u30101\u2020L197-L205\u3011\u30101\u2020L203-L210\u3011  \n- VanEck \u2013 *Ethereum 2030 Scenarios and \u201cDigital Oil\u201d Thesis*\u301029\u2020L156-L164\u3011\u301029\u2020L165-L168\u3011  \n- CFR \u2013 Crypto as inflation hedge debate, El Salvador\u2019s BTC usage data\u30108\u2020L1040-L1047\u3011\u30108\u2020L1051-L1059\u3011  \n- CFR \u2013 Crypto challenges (illicit use, volatility, central bank control concerns)\u30108\u2020L1117-L1124\u3011\u30108\u2020L1132-L1139\u3011  \n- Finimize/Aberdeen \u2013 *Digital Dollar and CBDC Impact* (2023)\u301032\u2020L221-L228\u3011\u301032\u2020L230-L238\u3011  \n- Fireblocks \u2013 *Quantum Computing Risk to Crypto* (2023)\u301035\u2020L224-L233\u3011\u301035\u2020L293-L301\u3011  \n\nThese sources and scenario rationales highlight the spectrum of outcomes.

This signaled that no entity is immune to U.S. financial coercion, prompting significant global reactions.\n\nThe intensified U.S. actions, including a record $231 million budget in 2025 for expanding sanctions enforcement, have accelerated de-dollarization efforts. Overreliance on sanctions has led central banks and investors to diversify away from the dollar into gold, yuan, and local currency arrangements. By 2025, the dollar's share in global reserves has dropped below 47%. Countries like China and India established direct yuan-rupee settlement systems, and ASEAN nations aim to increase intra-regional trade in local currencies by 2030.\n\nUltimately, while dollar weaponization provides effective short-term leverage, its overuse is undermining long-term dollar dominance.

Even when dissatisfied, most countries find switching costs high, and crises (pandemic 2020, gilt turmoil 2022, regional banking scare 2023) keep demonstrating that global investors run **toward** Treasuries, not away.  \n\n2. **But leverage is decaying at the margin.**  \n   * Over-use of sanctions\u2014first against Iran, then the unprecedented freeze of ~$300 bn in Russian reserves in 2022\u2014made clear that **sovereign assets are not sacrosanct** \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201.  That has accelerated reserve diversification (gold at 40-yr highs, yuan share growing, and hedging via commodities).  \n   * China, India, Brazil, and the Gulf states are **building partial work-arounds**: currency-swap lines, local-currency settlement platforms, regional rating agencies, even ruble- or yuan-backed stablecoins \ue200cite\ue202turn1news52\ue201.  None yet rivals the scale or safety of the U.S. system, but each slices a bit off its monopoly.  \n\n3. **The petrodollar hinge may loosen fastest.**  If Middle-East producers price just 20-30 % of crude in non-USD by the late-2030s\u2014a plausible outcome given China\u2019s import dominance\u2014global \u201cforced demand\u201d for dollars falls, and with it some capacity to externalize inflation.  Energy-transition scenarios compound that risk by **shrinking the overall crude invoicing pie**.  \n\n4. **Digital rails are a wild card.**  Should Washington shape global stablecoin standards or issue a widely adopted digital dollar, it could *extend* dollar reach into Web3 commerce.  If instead euro- or yuan-backed tokens, modular CBDC bridges, or commodity-pegged coins lead, the U.S. loses a key new channel.  \n\n5. **Military & geopolitical heft remain the ultimate back-stop.**  The U.S. can still trade security guarantees and market access for reserve recycling\u2014especially in NATO, Japan, and the Gulf.  However, allies\u2019 willingness to bankroll deficits will weaken if U.S. domestic politics embrace protectionism or if a multipolar security architecture coalesces.  \n\n### Bottom-Line Probabilities  \n\n| **Outcome by 2045** | **Probability** | **Implications for U.S. \u201cexporting\u201d inflation** |\n|---|---|---|\n| Dollar-centric system endures with only incremental erosion (USD \u2265 45 % reserves; Treasuries core safe asset) | **~60 %** | U.S. can still finance large deficits at preferential rates; global partners absorb part of inflation via reserve recycling, but bargaining power is weaker\u2014must pay modest yield premiums and tolerate more bilateral settlement in other units. |\n| Multipolar reserves (USD 25-45 %; euro/yuan/gold/stablecoins fill gap) | **~30 %** | U.S. retains tools like swap lines & sanctions but at higher economic cost; to compel absorption, must lean more on security ties or conditional market access. Inflation spill-over still occurs, yet exchange-rate pass-through to prices abroad is choppier. |\n| Rapid dollar decline (USD < 25 % reserves; fragmentation of payment rails) | **~10 %** | Washington loses most leverage to offload fiscal indiscipline; foreign investors demand much higher yields or avoid Treasuries; sanctions reach shrinks sharply. Remaining options: explicit trade or defense quid-pro-quo, IMF reforms, or fiscal tightening at home. |\n\n**Strategic takeaway:**  \nOver the next two decades the United States is *more likely than not* to retain enough monetary clout to externalize a meaningful share of any inflationary or fiscally profligate policy\u2014but the margin for coercion is **shrinking**.  The effectiveness of each lever will depend less on any single rival currency and more on the **cumulative nibbling of many alternatives** combined with the reputational cost of weaponizing the dollar too frequently.
