Major banks like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citibank are investing heavily in AI, using tools to streamline processes, from IPO filings to coding and client service. JPMorgan, for example, has rolled out AI to over 200,000 employees. Hedge funds such as Citadel, Bridgewater, and Point72 are leveraging AI to enhance investment strategies and automate analyst tasks. Private equity firms like Blackstone and EQT are using AI for enterprise search and deal sourcing, while asset managers like BlackRock and AllianceBernstein are incorporating AI into portfolio management and risk analysis.\n\nTech adoption is reshaping the finance job market, with AI creating new roles and changing the skills required, particularly for engineers and analysts. Tech firms and fintechs such as Kraken, Block, and Chime are also advancing AI tools to speed due diligence and product development. Meanwhile, public cloud providers like Amazon and Google Cloud are competing to supply AI infrastructure. Startups like Louisa AI and Mako AI are gaining traction by automating traditional banking tasks.

Below is a structured analysis and an action plan.\n\n---\n\n## 1  Why a portfolio matters\n\n| Value to recruiters | Value to you as an educator |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Screens in, not out** \u2013 Hiring pipelines increasingly ask for GitHub links or coding samples before scheduling interviews. A strong repo can get you past r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screens, sometimes replacing live coding rounds. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 | **Curriculum-in-a-box** \u2013 The same notebooks and code can be refactored into lecture demos, lab assignments, or capstone projects. |\n| **Proof of modern tooling** \u2013 Containers, CI, docstrings, and tests show you can ship production-quality research, a key 2025 hiring trend as quant teams integrate more ML engineering. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news20\ue202turn0search0\ue201 | **Pedagogical credibility** \u2013 Concrete, reproducible examples resonate more with students than slideware theory. |\n| **Signal of domain breadth** \u2013 Multiple well-chosen projects illustrate risk, derivatives, and data-driven alpha\u2014breadth that hiring managers prize in a thin market for experienced quants. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 | **Reusable assessment** \u2013 You can convert unit tests into auto-graded homework or use dashboards for in-class discussion. |\n\n---\n\n## 2  Hiring landscape, 2025 snapshot\n\n* **AI & ML skills are differentiators.** Banks and hedge funds are scaling gen-AI and predictive analytics; demand for Python-competent quants is rising faster than for pure theorists. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news20\ue201  \n* **Non-competes & retention pressures** mean firms favour candidates who bring demonstrable flexibility (multiple asset classes, clean code) and require shorter ramp-up time. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n* **Online footprints matter.** Recruiters routinely Google candidates; a polished, public repo stands out\u2014especially when many r\u00e9sum\u00e9s tout identical buzzwords. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 3  What to build \u2013 ten project archetypes\n\n| # | Project concept | Core competencies demonstrated | Teaching reuse |\n|---|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| 1 | **Derivatives library** (Black\u2013Scholes + Monte Carlo Greeks, JIT-compiled) | Stochastic calc, numerical methods, software design | Lab on sensitivities; homework on calibration |\n| 2 | **Back-testing engine** with factor models & transaction-cost simulation | Data engineering, event-driven arch, risk analytics | Case study: Fama\u2013French replication |\n| 3 | **Black-Litterman optimiser** with interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly) | Bayesian stats, convex optimisation, UX | Live demo for portfolio-construction lectures |\n| 4 | **Interest-rate curve builder** (Bootstrapping, SABR calibration) | Fixed-income math, non-linear optimisation | Problem set on curve shifts & risk |\n| 5 | **Credit-risk toolkit** (structural vs. reduced-form, logistic PD model) | Econometrics, probability of default, ROC analysis | Seminar on credit modelling pitfalls |\n| 6 | **Order-book simulator + RL execution agent** | Agent-based modelling, reinforcement learning | Showcase of market microstructure |\n| 7 | **Volatility forecasting notebook** (ARIMA/GARCH vs. LSTM) | Time-series, ML benchmarking | In-class model-comparison exercise |\n| 8 | **Alternative-data sentiment alpha** (NLP on news/Twitter, signal pipeline) | Text mining, feature engineering, back-testing | Workshop on alt-data hygiene |\n| 9 | **Risk dashboard** (VaR, ES, scenario stress) in a Flask or FastAPI micro-service | Full-stack dev, cloud deployment, CI/CD | Example of practitioner-grade reporting |\n| 10 | **QuantLib contribution / pull-request** | Open-source collaboration, peer code review | Teaches OSS workflow & software ethics |\n\n---\n\n## 4  Portfolio quality checklist\n\n1. **Reproducibility:** `requirements.txt` or `conda.yml`, Dockerfile, and data-download scripts.  \n2. **Testing:** Unit tests \u226580 % coverage; include stochastic tests with fixed RNG seeds.  \n3. **Documentation:** README with: problem, methods, data, results, future work.  \n4. **Version control hygiene:** granular commits, informative messages, GitHub Actions CI badge.  \n5. **Licensing & IP:** MIT/BSD for personal code; respect data-provider T&Cs.  \n6. **Insightful write-ups:** Link to a blog or Jupyter Book explaining theory and decisions.\n\n---\n\n## 5  Leveraging the portfolio if you pivot to teaching\n\n* **Syllabus backbone:** Map each project to lecture weeks; supply starter notebooks.  \n* **Assessment engine:** Adapt unit tests as autograders (e.g., nbgrader).  \n* **Marketing asset:** Demonstrates to schools or online-course platforms that you can teach applied quant hands-on.  \n* **Revenue streams:** Convert notebooks into paid Udemy/Coursera modules or run workshop bootcamps.\n\n---\n\n## 6  Risks & mitigations\n\n| Risk | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|\n| Shallow \u201ctoy\u201d feel | Use real-world datasets, document limitations, calibrate to market quotes. |\n| Code bloat / unfinished repos | Limit scope, publish only finished MVPs; archive WIP privately. |\n| IP conflicts with future employer | Keep personal projects clean of proprietary algorithms; consult HR. |\n| Outdated tech stack | Periodically refactor (e.g., migrate from pandas-style back-tester to vectorised Polars). |\n\n---\n\n## 7  Suggested 6-month roadmap\n\n1. **Month 1\u20132:** Derivatives library + exhaustive tests.  \n2. **Month 2\u20133:** Publish blog post, push to GitHub, solicit code reviews.  \n3. **Month 3\u20134:** Build back-testing engine and replicate two academic factors.  \n4. **Month 4\u20135:** Launch risk dashboard on free cloud tier; write teaching notes.  \n5. **Month 5\u20136:** Contribute one QuantLib PR; record a short demo lecture using the code.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n*For 2025\u2019s quant market, a polished coding portfolio is both a hiring magnet and an excellent teaching toolkit.*  \nGiven your mathematical depth and Python experience, the incremental effort is modest relative to the signalling benefit. Start with one high-quality project, treat it as publishable research code, and iterate."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":682,"end_idx":701,"safe_urls":["https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/v0hcea/should_i_hyperlink_github_repo_for_a_project_on/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/v0hcea/should_i_hyperlink_github_repo_for_a_project_on/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Should I hyperlink github repo for a project on my resume? : r/quant","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/v0hcea/should_i_hyperlink_github_repo_for_a_project_on/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1653782400.0,"snippet":"It's a great practice, as it shows many things about your work.
