","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 1 / 5>","Age of the Agent Orchestrator\r\nShyamal Hitesh Anadkat\r\nApplied AI @ OpenAI\r\nMay 18, 2025\r\nOver the past couple of years at OpenAI, many friends and family have often asked me \r\nwhat the world might look like when AI and agents can do \"everything\". it's a question \r\nwe\u2019re still collectively wrestling with. while that's not happening anytime soon, \r\ncapabilities are advancing quickly enough that it\u2019s worth thinking a step ahead.\r\nOne frame that I find useful is to ask what becomes scarce. Markets tend to organize \r\naround whatever is in short supply.\r\nWhen personal computers and then the internet showed up, the scarce thing became \r\nknowing how to write software. if you knew how to program, you could create a \r\ntremendous amount of value relative to almost anyone else. When Excel showed up, \r\nthe scarce thing for a while was knowing how to use it - you could model and \r\nunderstand a business better than the people still doing math on paper.\r\nOnce you can reliably put a spreadsheet, a legal brief, a codebase, a marketing plan, a \r\nbudget, or whatever else into a loop with a capable model - ask it to do the work, check \r\nthe work, improve the work, and repeat - the scarce thing is no longer \"who knows \r\nhow to do that task by hand\". The scarce thing becomes \"who can orchestrate \r\nresources well\" - compute, capital, access to data, and human/expert judgment.\r\nHere are three consequences I see if we get to that world:\r\nExpertise gets democratized.\r\nThe premium shifts from \"I know the tax code\" to \"I can design the loop that gets \r\nthe right answer and runs cheaply\".","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 2 / 5>","Right now, you hire an expert to do your taxes because the space of possible mistakes is \r\nlarge and the cost of being wrong is high. If you can build (or rent) an agent that can do a \r\ncompetent job of your taxes, ask for feedback, double-check edge cases, and improve \r\nover time, then the gatekeeping function of the expert goes away. There will still be \r\nexperts - we will need people to provide judgment, to set the high-level strategy, to \r\nhandle the weird cases - but the leverage point moves. Knowing the details of the tax \r\ncode will be less valuable than knowing how to set up an autonomous workflow that \r\nproduces a correct return, flags the ambiguous parts for a human to look at, and costs \r\n$0.05 in compute instead of $5. This is great news for a lot of people.\r\nThe knowledge that used to require years of schooling and apprenticeships will be \r\naccessible to anyone who can chat, call an API, and structure a loop. it's also going to \r\nbe uncomfortable for people whose status is tied up in being the only ones who can do\r\nsomething. If you're training for a career because you believe the information is \r\nscarce, it's worth asking yourself what happens when it's not. If you're training to be \r\nthe person who can take all of the cheap information and turn it into a valuable \r\noutcome, you're on firmer ground.\r\nResource optimization matters a lot more.\r\nWe are going to have to get very good at assigning FLOPs/compute, liquidity, lab \r\ntime, human review, etc., to autonomous workflows/agents. This is a new job.\r\nToday, if you want to do a big marketing analysis, you send it to your analyst and she \r\ntells you it'll be done in two weeks. She has some rough mental model of her own time \r\nand the other things on her plate. In a world where you can spin up 10k agents to do 10k \r\nanalyses, your bottlenecks become very different. Your compute cluster is finite. Your \r\nbudget is finite. The number of hours your expert reviewers have is finite. If you spray \r\ntasks everywhere without thinking, you'll hit resource limits fast. The teams that know \r\nhow to prioritize which agent gets which compute, when to spend $10 on more compute \r\nversus when to ask a human for 5 minutes of feedback, how to queue up a million tasks \r\novernight when energy is cheap, how to take advantage of low-liquidity windows, and so \r\non, are going to have a big advantage.\r\nStartups have always had to allocate capital carefully. In this new regime, you have to \r\nallocate compute carefully too. It's not a \"set it and forget it\" situation - models will get \r\nbetter, costs will go down, new tasks will appear. you will need people whose job is \r\nliterally to orchestrate fleets of AI agents and the scarce resources they need. Think of it \r\nlike an air traffic controller or \"orchestrator\" for agents. the very best companies already \r\ndo some of this. They optimize cloud spend, they schedule jobs, they think about \r\ncapital efficiency. But most companies are extremely wasteful with both human and \r\nmachine time. That won't be sustainable when the throughput of work an organization \r\ncan do is limited by its ability to coordinate.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 5>","Literacy in managing agents becomes the new Excel.\r\nKnowing how to break down a task, set a reward, audit a run is going to be a \r\nbaseline skill.\r\nCompanies that run lots of agent A/B tests and bake that into their culture will \r\ncompound faster than the ones that try to bolt AI onto old workflows and drown in \r\ncomplexity. When Excel showed up, there was a window of time where if you knew how \r\nto use it, you were special. Then it became table stakes - if you worked in finance and \r\ndidn't know how to use a spreadsheet, you were unemployable. The same thing is going \r\nto happen with managing AI agents. being able to write a decent prompt, set up a \r\nfeedback loop, monitor the outputs, tweak the reward function, and run an experiment \r\nto see if version A or version B of your agent loop works better will be as expected as \r\nknowing how to make a pivot table.

They will \r\ncreate complexity, have shadow processes, and end up with humans checking AI \r\nchecking humans. The companies that are willing to reimagine their workflows around \r\nagents, to run lots of experiments, to build internal tooling for agent management, are \r\ngoing to compound. Culture eats strategy. If you don't create an environment where \r\npeople are comfortable delegating to machines, measuring the outcomes, and \r\niterating, you'll miss out on a huge amount of leverage.\r\nOne of the most satisfying frameworks I\u2019ve found for understanding AI progress is \r\nthe METR curve, which measures AI performance based on the length of tasks AI \r\nagents can complete.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 5>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-AiG1Nf4A74654ZTGF73hPp","size_bytes":145798,"width":768,"height":1024,"fovea":768,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 5>","METR\r\n\"Extrapolating this trend predicts that, in under a decade, we will see AI agents that \r\ncan independently complete a large fraction of software tasks that currently take \r\nhumans days or weeks.\"\r\nNone of this happens overnight.
