This marked a dramatic escalation in Middle East tensions and ended ongoing diplomatic talks concerning Iran's near-complete nuclear program. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation aimed to neutralize Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities and could continue indefinitely. Despite Donald Trump's past promises to restore Middle East stability and his current stance favoring diplomacy, the Trump administration distanced itself from Israel's unilateral action, emphasizing the safety of American forces. Nonetheless, the conflict risks drawing the U.S. into the fray due to longstanding alliances with Israel and regional partners like Saudi Arabia. The geopolitical shake-up immediately impacted financial markets, triggering sharp rises in oil prices and drops in stock futures, although Iran\u2019s oil facilities were not initially targeted.

President Trump indicated he preferred diplomatic efforts but affirmed support for Israel\u2019s security.\n\nAmid fears of wider conflict, the U.S. advised diplomatic personnel in Israel to shelter, and Israel closed its airspace. Oil prices surged and stock markets reacted negatively. While Israeli officials stressed the attack targeted Iran's regime rather than its people, concerns of regional escalation remain high as both sides brace for potential retaliation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749784380.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran","title":"June 2025 Israeli strikes on Iran","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749785071.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran","title":"October 2024 Israeli strikes on Iran","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744565371.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_airstrike_on_the_Iranian_consulate_in_Damascus","title":"Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1748846733.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Israeli_strikes_in_Iran","title":"June 2025 Israeli strikes in Iran","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749785080.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel","title":"October 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749783540.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war","title":"United States support for Israel in the Gaza war","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749663168.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_684b9c24e6a88007a177806395c6cf9f","search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_search","client_reported_search_source":"conversation_composer_web_icon","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"9b31b5dc-14dd-44c0-88ca-e58ee98a68d0","request_id":"94ee877c5c4a9f74-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9b31b5dc-14dd-44c0-88ca-e58ee98a68d0","children":["e6d8ca38-722e-43a2-8bcd-c6f4725c1b80"]},"e6d8ca38-722e-43a2-8bcd-c6f4725c1b80":{"id":"e6d8ca38-722e-43a2-8bcd-c6f4725c1b80","message":{"id":"e6d8ca38-722e-43a2-8bcd-c6f4725c1b80","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1749785647.25442,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for a couple of seconds"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":2,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"0b2eedc6-9ab6-4f31-9d0e-1bac3bcac5ea","request_id":"94ee877c5c4a9f74-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0b2eedc6-9ab6-4f31-9d0e-1bac3bcac5ea","children":["6b68474f-48ff-4fd9-94d8-ca23a1964960"]},"6b68474f-48ff-4fd9-94d8-ca23a1964960":{"id":"6b68474f-48ff-4fd9-94d8-ca23a1964960","message":{"id":"6b68474f-48ff-4fd9-94d8-ca23a1964960","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web","sonicberry_model_id":"alpha.sonicberry_2s_p","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1749785637.882906,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here are the **latest developments** (as of today, June\u00a013,\u00a02025) regarding Israel\u2019s military action against Iran and the current U.S. government stance:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 Israel\u2019s Operation \u201cRising Lion\u201d\n\n- **What happened:** In pre-dawn hours on **June 13, 2025**, Israel launched a major airstrike campaign\u2014dubbed **Operation Rising\u202fLion** or \u201cAm KeLavi\u201d\u2014against multiple Iranian targets, including nuclear facilities (notably **Natanz**), missile production sites, military installations, and reportedly also residential areas around Tehran \ue200cite\ue202turn0news9\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search25\ue201.\n- **Targets and casualties:** Iranian state media and intelligence report that high-ranking IRGC figures, including commander **Hossein Salami**, along with other senior military leaders and several nuclear scientists, were killed \ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue202turn0news22\ue202turn0search25\ue201.\n- **Scale & duration:** Israeli officials, including PM **Netanyahu** and Defense Minister Katz, stated the strikes could **continue \"for as many days as it takes\"** to dismantle Iran\u2019s immediate nuclear and missile threats.

This marked a dramatic escalation in Middle East tensions and ended ongoing diplomatic talks concerning Iran's near-complete nuclear program. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation aimed to neutralize Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities and could continue indefinitely. Despite Donald Trump's past promises to restore Middle East stability and his current stance favoring diplomacy, the Trump administration distanced itself from Israel's unilateral action, emphasizing the safety of American forces. Nonetheless, the conflict risks drawing the U.S. into the fray due to longstanding alliances with Israel and regional partners like Saudi Arabia. The geopolitical shake-up immediately impacted financial markets, triggering sharp rises in oil prices and drops in stock futures, although Iran\u2019s oil facilities were not initially targeted.

The Israeli military employed aging air-to-air refuelers to reach the targets, though it's unclear if jets entered Iranian airspace.\n\nThe strike follows Iran's defiance of IAEA oversight and advancement of its nuclear program, prompting international concern. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited an existential threat driving the operations. The timing is critical, as it occurred days before scheduled U.S.-Iran nuclear talks in Oman. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed Israel acted unilaterally while urging Iran not to retaliate against U.S. assets.\n\nGlobal reaction includes condemnation from Australia and New Zealand, and concerns from U.S. Senator Jack Reed over regional destabilization. Iran vowed a decisive response, and explosions were heard throughout Tehran. Brent crude oil prices surged over 8% amid fears of broader conflict. Israel closed its airspace, anticipating retaliation, as commercial flights rerouted out of Iranian airspace.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation aimed to neutralize Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities and could continue indefinitely. Despite Donald Trump's past promises to restore Middle East stability and his current stance favoring diplomacy, the Trump administration distanced itself from Israel's unilateral action, emphasizing the safety of American forces. Nonetheless, the conflict risks drawing the U.S. into the fray due to longstanding alliances with Israel and regional partners like Saudi Arabia. The geopolitical shake-up immediately impacted financial markets, triggering sharp rises in oil prices and drops in stock futures, although Iran\u2019s oil facilities were not initially targeted. Analysts warn of significant global repercussions if the situation escalates, especially if the United States becomes actively involved in the conflict.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"Explosionen bei Teheran - Israel f\u00fchrt \u201ePr\u00e4ventivschlag\" gegen den Iran aus","url":"https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article256245584/Naher-Osten-Explosionen-bei-Teheran-Israel-fuehrt-Praeventivschlag-gegen-den-Iran-aus.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749774639.0,"snippet":"Am 13.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the attack as a necessary measure to ensure the nation's survival, following intelligence reports indicating Iran had enriched enough uranium to potentially build nuclear weapons within days. The airstrikes reportedly killed high-ranking Iranian military officials, including Revolutionary Guard head Gen. Hossein Salami, military chief Mohammad Bagheri, and two nuclear scientists. Significant damage was reported at Iran's main nuclear enrichment site in Natanz. The United States, represented by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, clarified it had no involvement in the strikes but expressed concern for the safety of American personnel in the region. In response, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed severe retaliation. The international community is showing mixed reactions, with some U.S. officials publicly supporting Israel, emphasizing Iran must not acquire nuclear weapons. Domestically, increased security measures have been implemented in U.S. cities such as New York.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation aimed to neutralize Iran's nuclear weaponization capabilities and would continue until the threat is eliminated. High-profile casualties reported by Iranian state media include Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Chief Commander Hossein Salami and nuclear scientists Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the precision strikes were accompanied by Mossad-led covert sabotage operations targeting missile and air defense infrastructures. U.S. officials, although not involved in the operation, monitored the events closely, with President Trump\u2019s administration emphasizing the protection of U.S. forces. Diplomatic evacuations had begun across the region earlier amid rising tensions. The U.S. response has been mixed, with lawmakers divided on whether the strikes were justified or intended to derail ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran.

The airstrikes reportedly killed high-ranking Iranian military officials, including Revolutionary Guard head Gen. Hossein Salami, military chief Mohammad Bagheri, and two nuclear scientists.

The international community is showing mixed reactions, with some U.S. officials publicly supporting Israel, emphasizing Iran must not acquire nuclear weapons.

In Israel wurde der Ausnahmezustand verh\u00e4ngt, Schulen blieben geschlossen in Erwartung eines m\u00f6glichen Vergeltungsschlags seitens Irans. Die USA erkl\u00e4rten, sie seien nicht an dem Angriff beteiligt worden, betonten jedoch den Schutz ihrer Truppen in der Region. Pr\u00e4sident Trump \u00e4u\u00dferte zuvor Zweifel an einem israelischen Angriff, warb f\u00fcr eine diplomatische L\u00f6sung und bem\u00fchte sich um ein neues Atomabkommen mit dem Iran. Nur wenige Stunden vor dem Angriff hatte Teheran den Bau einer weiteren Nuklearanlage angek\u00fcndigt, was m\u00f6glicherweise den Ausl\u00f6ser f\u00fcr Israels Vorgehen darstellte.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749774639.0,"attribution":"www.welt.de"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.cbsnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-launches-strike-on-iran-sources-say/","title":"Israel launches strikes on Iran, attacking nuclear sites and other ...","snippet":"The United States was not part of the operation and was not involved in intelligence sharing, multiple U.S. sources told CBS News, and Secretary ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749785885.507296,"attribution":"www.cbsnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.axios.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/2025/06/12/israel-strike-iran-us-not-participate","title":"U.S. told Israel it won't participate in an Israeli strike on Iran","snippet":"The Trump administration has informed the Israeli government that the U.S. will not participate in any Israeli military strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.

What the record supports is a U-S policy of **anticipating an Israeli decision it could not block, erecting political firewalls to avoid entanglement, and quietly preparing to contain blow-back**.  That approach\u2014sometimes called *\u201cdetached enablement\u201d*\u2014does incidentally serve longstanding American interests in degrading Iran\u2019s nuclear program without expending U-S blood or treasure, but the available data stop well short of proving deliberate orchestration.  Below is a structured assessment of the hypothesis and the evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Key chronology and public positions\n\n| Date (2025) | Event | US signal |\n|-------------|-------|-----------|\n| **11 Jun** | *Washington Post* reveals NSC task-force planning for possible Israeli strike and partial draw-down of U-S personnel \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue201 | \u201cWe want no war with Iran\u201d \u2013 senior official briefing |\n| **12 Jun (am)** | Axios & Reuters report the White House told Israel **it would not participate** in any attack \ue200cite\ue202turn0news47\ue202turn0search2\ue201 | Trump: strike \u201c*could very well happen*,\u201d but diplomacy still preferred \ue200cite\ue202turn0news52\ue201 |\n| **12 Jun (pm)** | Israeli war cabinet finalises *Operation Rising Lion* | \u2014\n| **13 Jun 02:10 IDT** | Israel strikes Natanz, Tehran, other sites \ue200cite\ue202turn0news51\ue202turn0search10\ue201 | Rubio within 30 min: \u201c**We are not involved** \u2026 primary goal is protecting our forces\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0news49\ue202turn0search11\ue201 |\n\nThese data points demonstrate advance U-S knowledge and rapid distancing, but not overt pressure on Jerusalem.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What Washington *did* (and why it looks calculated)\n\n### 2.1  Built a \u201cnon-involvement\u201d paper-trail  \n* Multiple authoritative denials\u2014Rubio, NSC press briefer, Pentagon\u2014repeated the same language (\u201cunilateral,\u201d \u201cno assistance\u201d) within hours of the first explosions \ue200cite\ue202turn0news49\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0search17\ue201.  \n* Axios and Reuters leaks one day earlier established the policy line in advance, inoculating Washington against allegations of complicity \ue200cite\ue202turn0news47\ue202turn0search37\ue201.\n\n### 2.2  Quietly repositioned forces  \nThe Pentagon evacuated non-essential staff from CENTCOM hubs and redeployed a carrier strike group into the Arabian Sea, signalling deterrence but also physical stand-off \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue201.\n\n### 2.3  Maintained diplomatic optics  \nTrump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff continued to schedule Oman nuclear talks that everyone knew would collapse once bombs fell, giving the White House a \u201cwe tried diplomacy\u201d narrative \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue201.\n\n**Interpretation:** These steps point to *risk-containment*, not coercive puppeteering.  They maximise strategic benefit (damaged Iranian program) while minimising political cost.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  What Washington *did not* do (evidence against orchestration)\n\n1. **No intelligence hand-over confirmed.**  CBS, ABC and Guardian quote multiple U-S officials saying *no intel or logistic support* was provided \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0news51\ue201.  \n2. **Prior policy papers urge caution.**  CSIS analysis two months earlier argued Israel *could not* thoroughly cripple Iran without U-S assets, casting doubt on a U-S plan to outsource the job entirely \ue200cite\ue202turn0search28\ue201.  \n3. **Domestic politics mis-align.**  Trump faces an election-year base averse to another Middle-East war; overt encouragement of a strike that could drag Americans in would be politically risky.  His public preference for a \u201cdeal\u201d is consistent with that constraint \ue200cite\ue202turn0news52\ue201.  \n4. **Israeli agency is decisive.**  Netanyahu has long threatened unilateral action if centrifuge breakout time fell below weeks.  Times of Israel and Welt quote Israeli officials framing the attack as an existential necessity, *not* U-S prompting \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0news53\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Strategic incentives: Why \u201cdetached enablement\u201d still suits Washington\n\n| U-S Objective | Achieved by current posture? | How |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|-----|\n| Prevent a nuclear-armed Iran | **Partly yes** | Physical damage to Natanz and killing key scientists set back enrichment timeline \ue200cite\ue202turn0news51\ue201 |\n| Avoid large-scale Middle-East war | **Uncertain** | Distancing lowers escalation ladder, but Iranian retaliation could still hit U-S assets \ue200cite\ue202turn0news48\ue202turn0search24\ue201 |\n| Maintain global focus on China | **Yes (for now)** | No new U-S force surge; pivot bandwidth preserved \ue200cite\ue202turn0search30\ue201 |\n| Domestic political optics | **Yes** | Trump can claim he neither \u201cgreen-lit war\u201d nor let Iran go nuclear |\n\nThus, even without directing Israel, Washington benefits from the outcome.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Precedents & intellectual lineage\n\n* The 2009 Brookings study **\u201cWhich Path to Persia?\u201d** openly floated using an Israeli strike as a deniable proxy to damage Iran\u2019s program \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201.  \n* Brookings (2019) and Atlantic Council (2025) experts have noted that U-S and Israeli threat perceptions overlap but tactics diverge; the U-S often signals restraint publicly while enabling Israel\u2019s freedom of action privately \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search15\ue201.\n\nThese precedents show the *idea* is not new, but they do not prove current coordination.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Overall assessment\n\n* **Plausibility:** High-level convergence of interests plus foreknowledge makes *implicit* U-S enabling plausible.  \n* **Evidence threshold:** The public record offers **circumstantial alignment, not direct causation**.  There is no leaked directive, logistics manifest, or intelligence-sharing confirmation tying Washington to the planning.  \n* **Alternative explanation:** Israel acted when it judged breakout imminent; Washington, unable to dissuade its ally, executed a **damage-limitation strategy**\u2014politically distancing while readying regional defenses.

This comes amid reports suggesting that Israel is preparing operations to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Trump reinforced the U.S. position that Iran must not develop nuclear weapons, although he expressed a preference for a diplomatic solution over military intervention. His special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, is actively pursuing a negotiated agreement. However, Trump expressed growing skepticism about reaching such a deal, citing Iran's reluctance to make concessions in ongoing indirect talks. Despite not offering U.S. military support, he confirmed that some U.S. personnel are being withdrawn from the Middle East as a precaution. Trump emphasized the desire for a peaceful resolution but acknowledged the possibility of escalation if diplomatic efforts fail.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"nypost.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0news53\ue201","start_idx":3931,"end_idx":3963,"safe_urls":["https://www.timesofisrael.com/an-immediate-operational-necessity-why-israel-finally-attacked-irans-nuclear-facilities/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article256245584/Naher-Osten-Explosionen-bei-Teheran-Israel-fuehrt-Praeventivschlag-gegen-den-Iran-aus.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/an-immediate-operational-necessity-why-israel-finally-attacked-irans-nuclear-facilities/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [welt.de](https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article256245584/Naher-Osten-Explosionen-bei-Teheran-Israel-fuehrt-Praeventivschlag-gegen-den-Iran-aus.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Why Israel finally attacked Iran's nuclear facilities | The Times of Israel","url":"https://www.timesofisrael.com/an-immediate-operational-necessity-why-israel-finally-attacked-irans-nuclear-facilities/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749782045.142803,"snippet":"The attack, he said, was \u201can immediate operational necessity\u201d \u2014 an imperative, he said, \u201cto remove the strategic threat and ensure our future.\u201d.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":12}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"timesofisrael.com"},{"title":"Explosionen bei Teheran - Israel f\u00fchrt \u201ePr\u00e4ventivschlag\" gegen den Iran aus","url":"https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article256245584/Naher-Osten-Explosionen-bei-Teheran-Israel-fuehrt-Praeventivschlag-gegen-den-Iran-aus.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749774639.0,"snippet":"Am 13.

These unilateral strikes come just as the U.S. was preparing for a sixth round of diplomatic talks with Iran concerning its uranium enrichment program. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that the U.S. was not involved in the attacks but had prior knowledge of Israel's intentions and is focused on protecting American personnel in the region. The strikes have heightened tensions, complicating President Trump's efforts to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran. The International Atomic Energy Agency has declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in nearly two decades. Trump has signified a preference for diplomacy but acknowledged the risk of conflict. The incident strains U.S.-Israel relations, particularly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom Trump disagrees on both Iran and Gaza policy. Meanwhile, concerns about regional retaliation have prompted the U.S. to withdraw some personnel from the Middle East, and the status of upcoming U.S.-Iran talks in Oman remains uncertain.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749784239.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rubio-says-us-not-involved-israeli-strikes-against-iran-2025-06-13/","title":"Rubio calls Israeli strikes against Iran 'unilateral,' says US not involved","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749775953.172689,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/oil-prices-jump-more-than-4-after-israel-strikes-iran-2025-06-13/","title":"Oil jumps more than 7% as Israel strikes Iran, rattling investors","snippet":"Oil prices jumped more than 7% on Friday, hitting their highest in months after Israel said it struck Iran, dramatically escalating tensions ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749783153.328065,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/view-stocks-oil-sell-off-israel-strikes-iran-2025-06-13/","title":"Analyst reactions to stock selloff, oil price surge","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749779553.17849,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/whats-behind-irans-long-tussle-with-united-states-2025-06-12/","title":"What's behind Iran's long tussle with the United States? - Reuters","snippet":"The United States has pulled some diplomatic staff and military families out of the Middle East, citing unspecified regional security risks.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749725589.925455,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.whitehouse.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/06/statement-from-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio/","title":"Statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio - The White House","snippet":"\u201cTonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran.

Non-interventionism remains a central tenet of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d ideology, alongside immigration and trade, making military involvement in the Middle East a potential flashpoint. Trump stated he prefers negotiation over conflict and recently told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he still sees a chance for a nuclear deal with Iran. Influential MAGA figures, such as podcaster Jack Posobiec, have warned that direct action against Iran could divide Trump\u2019s base and hurt Republicans in the upcoming midterms. The issue underscores longstanding divisions within Trump\u2019s team concerning Iran strategy and highlights the contentious role of Israel in U.S. foreign policy among Trump supporters.

However, the resistance to Trump's nominees, Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, within the party is weak.

If Israel follows through on its promise to sustain the offensive, expect Washington to double-down on *containment without co-combatancy*: reinforce theatre defences and evacuation plans, push de-escalation diplomacy at the U.N. while vetoing any resolution that singles out Israel, tighten sanctions on Iran\u2019s missile suppliers, and prepare energy-market stabilisers such as a possible Strategic Petroleum Reserve release.  Below is a detailed assessment.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why \u201cdetached enablement\u201d fits U.S. long-term interests\n\n### 1.1  Non-proliferation without a quagmire  \nIsrael\u2019s initial strikes knocked out Natanz enrichment halls and killed senior IRGC nuclear personnel, an effect the IAEA says could push Iran\u2019s programme \u201cyears, not months, backward.\u201d\ue200cite\ue202turn7view4\ue201  Achieving the same result unilaterally would have required a sustained U.S. air-ground campaign\u2014precisely the scenario the Trump administration has signalled it wants to avoid.\ue200cite\ue202turn7view2\ue202turn0news70\ue201\n\n### 1.2  Preserving strategic bandwidth for China  \nCSIS notes that the administration\u2019s top strategic priority remains deterring China and that any large U.S.\u2013Iran war would \u201cbleed the Indo-Pacific pivot dry.\u201d\ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  By letting Israel act, Washington keeps carrier strike groups and high-demand assets available for the Pacific.  \n\n### 1.3  Alliance management without overextension  \nOpen non-involvement defuses Arab-Gulf accusations of U.S. escalation even as backstage intelligence and materiel sharing reassure Israel.  Axios reporting shows the White House balancing a pro-Israel wing and a non-interventionist MAGA base; visible distance is therefore politically valuable.\ue200cite\ue202turn3view9\ue201\n\n### 1.4  Domestic political optics  \nSecretary Rubio\u2019s immediate declaration that the strike was \u201cunilateral\u201d and that Washington\u2019s only priority is force-protection pre-empted bipartisan war-weariness in an election season.\ue200cite\ue202turn7view2\ue201\n\n### 1.5  Energy-market and financial stability  \nOil spiked 7 % on the strike news, underlining vulnerability.\ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  By staying out militarily, Washington retains the option to calm markets\u2014via Gulf diplomacy, sanctions waivers for selected importers, or an SPR release\u2014without risking tankers in a shooting war.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Likely U.S. policy moves over the next few days\n\n### 2.1  Force-protection & deterrence  \n* **Redeployments:** The Pentagon has already authorised evacuations from Baghdad and other posts\ue200cite\ue202turn7view1\ue201 and is expected to keep carrier groups in the Arabian Sea on air-defence stations.  \n* **Missile-defence surge:** Expect emergency transfers of Iron Dome interceptors and Patriot/THAAD reinforcements to both Israel and key Gulf bases\u2014measures that help partners absorb retaliation while preserving the \u201chands-off\u201d narrative.  \n\n### 2.2  Diplomatic positioning  \n* **UN track:** The U.S. will call for \u201crestraint on all sides\u201d yet threaten a veto on any resolution that condemns Israel without equal censure of Iran\u2019s nuclear violations\u2014mirroring recent U.S. Security-Council votes on Gaza.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n* **Back-channel pressure on Jerusalem:** Washington will privately urge Netanyahu to declare limited objectives once critical facilities are disabled, avoiding a slide into regime-change war that could trigger broader U.S. involvement.   \n\n### 2.3  Economic & sanctions toolkit  \n* **Snap-back sanctions:** Treasury lawyers are drafting expanded designations on Iranian missile suppliers and drone manufacturers.  \n* **Energy-price cushioning:** Officials are actively modelling an SPR draw and coordination with Saudi Arabia to raise spare capacity if Strait-of-Hormuz traffic is disrupted.

This marked a dramatic escalation in Middle East tensions and ended ongoing diplomatic talks concerning Iran's near-complete nuclear program. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation aimed to neutralize Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities and could continue indefinitely. Despite Donald Trump's past promises to restore Middle East stability and his current stance favoring diplomacy, the Trump administration distanced itself from Israel's unilateral action, emphasizing the safety of American forces. Nonetheless, the conflict risks drawing the U.S. into the fray due to longstanding alliances with Israel and regional partners like Saudi Arabia. The geopolitical shake-up immediately impacted financial markets, triggering sharp rises in oil prices and drops in stock futures, although Iran\u2019s oil facilities were not initially targeted. Analysts warn of significant global repercussions if the situation escalates, especially if the United States becomes actively involved in the conflict.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749782700.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.aei.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/after-the-strike-is-the-us-ready-for-the-diplomatic-fallout-in-iran/","title":"After the Strike: Is the US Ready for the Diplomatic Fallout in Iran?","snippet":"Key Points \u2013 While the world focuses on the military possibility of an imminent Israeli strike on Iran, the United States may be unprepared ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749777896.122451,"attribution":"www.aei.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-plans-give-harsh-response-israeli-attack-iranian-security-source-reuters-2025-06-13/","title":"Iran plans to 'give a harsh response' to Israeli attack, Iranian security ...","snippet":"Iran is planning to 'give a harsh response' to an Israeli attack launched early on Friday against its nuclear programme, an Iranian security ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749781496.126573,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wsj.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-attack-iran-nuclear-program-ac023cd5?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAj3v3apuCLbxM1XDPYez_Kt0KtEdc2CNuFMls_eSfAbFF-9gguqzC6U&gaa_sig=JXWv4iBQ_iE6TCHb0j7vpOTTziSu-NoNztm-Pak43gw-vfKeyaMj5mQHDIxH_aJnHuWUmrHvKUuLjV-oeoosYw%3D%3D&gaa_ts=684bc7bb","title":"Israeli Attack on Iran Could Come Within Days, U.S. and ... - WSJ","snippet":"Israel is prepared to attack Iran in the coming days if Tehran rejects a U.S. proposal that would place tough limits on its nuclear program, ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749763496.12997,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.nbcwashington.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/business/money-report/israels-defense-minister-announces-special-situation-after-israeli-attack-on-iran/3935152/?noamp=mobile&os=sasdc&ref=app","title":"Israel attacks Iran, targeting nuclear program with airstrikes","snippet":"Israel has launched a series of airstrikes in Iran, and escalated the simmering conflict between the two nations into a full-on war.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749781496.126573,"attribution":"www.nbcwashington.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"m.economictimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/world-war-iii-fears-surge-as-u-s-official-warns-of-unprecedented-danger-amid-israels-potential-strike-on-iran/articleshow/121807884.cms","title":"israel iran conflict: World War III fears surge as U.S. official warns of ...","snippet":"World War 3 fears are rising fast as Israel reportedly prepares for a military strike on Iran without U.S. support, shaking global stability.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749749096.133074,"attribution":"m.economictimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran","title":"June 2025 Israeli strikes on Iran - Wikipedia","snippet":"In the early morning hours of 13 June 2025, Israel began launching large-scale attacks against targets in several areas in Iran.

Once allies during the early 20th century, relations soured after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which overthrew the U.S.-backed Shah. Revolutionary students seized the U.S. embassy, holding hostages for over a year. Tensions worsened through proxy conflicts, such as Iran's support for Hezbollah and U.S. backing of Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, as well as an accidental U.S. attack on an Iranian airliner in 1988. Relations saw brief improvement in the late 1990s but deteriorated again after the early 2000s, notably when Iran\u2019s secret nuclear program came to light and President George W. Bush labeled Iran part of the \"Axis of Evil.\"\n\nIran supports armed groups across the region, including Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Hamas, while the U.S. backs Israel and Sunni Gulf nations. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal temporarily eased tensions, but was abandoned by President Trump in 2018, reigniting concerns over Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Israel sees Iran as a top threat and has reportedly conducted covert operations against it.

Israel claimed the strikes targeted Iranian nuclear facilities to prevent the development of atomic weapons. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio affirmed the strikes were unilateral and not assisted by the U.S., emphasizing American priorities lie in safeguarding its personnel in the region. The timing of the attacks complicates ongoing nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, with another round of talks planned for Sunday in Oman. While President Trump has publicly favored a diplomatic resolution, he acknowledged the potential for military conflict, stating Iran must provide more in negotiations. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in nearly two decades. Tensions have escalated, with the U.S. relocating personnel from the Middle East and issuing warnings to Iran against targeting American interests.

The U.S. has begun evacuating non-essential personnel from its embassy in Iraq and authorized voluntary departures from other Middle Eastern locations, including Bahrain and Kuwait, due to unspecified security threats. These moves have pushed oil prices up temporarily and raised fears of regional escalation. Meanwhile, Iran's defense minister warned the U.S. that Iranian forces would target regional American bases if provoked. Intelligence suggests growing concern over possible Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear installations, and British maritime authorities have advised caution for ships transiting critical waterways near Iran. Despite the tensions, foreign energy operations in Iraq continue unaffected. The situation reflects persistent volatility following the Gaza war's onset in 2023 and ongoing attacks by Iran-aligned groups in Iraq, although such attacks have decreased recently.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749714250.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/investigations/3-weeks-that-changed-world-how-trump-turned-against-ukraine-europe-2025-03-10/","title":"How Trump turned against Ukraine and Europe | Reuters","snippet":"The reporting lays bare how American officials tried and failed to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to sign a crucial minerals ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1741564800.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/arc/outboundfeeds/sitemap3/2021-06-09/?outputType=xml","title":"[XML] https://www.reuters.com/arc/outboundfeeds/sitemap3/2021-06-09 ...","snippet":"... trump-effort-halt-russia-probe-transcript-2021-06-09/</loc><lastmod>2021-06-09T22:33:40.659Z</lastmod><image:image><image:loc>https://www.reuters.com ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/static/video-sitemap/us/video-2024-04.xml","title":"[XML] https://www.reuters.com/static/video-sitemap/us/video-2024-04.xml","snippet":"...

An Iranian state hostile to Moscow **could** still serve as a brake on further Russian reach into the Gulf\u2014but Tehran has tightened military and energy ties with Moscow since 2022, cutting directly against Friedman\u2019s envisaged role.\n\n2. **Balance against Sunni extremism:**  \n   Shared U-S\u2013Iran interests in defeating ISIS (2014-19) confirmed Friedman\u2019s logic. That incentive persists in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n3. **Energy and maritime chokepoints:**  \n   Iran sits astride the Strait of Hormuz, and any U-S strategy that reduces the burden of Gulf policing still benefits from a stable (or at least predictable) Tehran.\n\n4. **Great-power competition:**  \n   China, not Russia, is now the primary peer competitor. Beijing buys discounted Iranian oil and supplies dual-use tech. A *future* U-S attempt to peel Iran away from China would echo Friedman\u2019s balancing instinct, though from a different threat vector.\n\n**Net assessment:** Iran\u2019s potential as a geopolitical counter-weight is **still there in theory**, but in practice Tehran has drifted into the rival camp. That makes immediate rapprochement *harder*, not easier, than Friedman assumed.\n\n---\n\n### 4  Post-strike realities (June 2025) and the outlook for \u201caccommodation\u201d\n\n| Factor | Current trajectory | Implication for a U-S\u2013Iran deal |\n|--------|--------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Domestic U-S politics** | Election year; both parties wary of another war, but Congress is even less forgiving of Iran after Israeli casualties. |  **Political ceiling lowered** \u2013 any overt outreach is toxic for now. |\n| **Iranian politics** | Supreme Leader views strike as U-S-backed, strengthening hard-liners demanding retaliation. |  **Negotiating floor collapsed** \u2013 Muscat channel frozen. |\n| **U-S strategic priorities** | Indo-Pacific \u201cpivot\u201d still paramount \ue200cite\ue202turn6search8\ue201; Washington wants out of Middle-East quagmires. |  **Long-term need for burden-sharing remains**, so incentive for some future modus vivendi endures. |\n| **Regional geometry** | Saudi-Israeli tacit axis vs. Iran deepened; China positioning as mediator. |  Space for a *U-S-brokered* accommodation has narrowed. |\n\n---\n\n### 5  Bottom-line judgement\n\n1. **Historical accuracy:** Fried\u00adman was largely right that U-S grand strategy would *seek* an accommodation with Iran once passions cooled; the JCPOA era and the 2023-25 Oman process illustrate that impulse.\n\n2. **Present validity (mid-2025):** The Israeli strike\u2014and Washington\u2019s choice of \u201cdetached enablement\u201d rather than open partnership\u2014puts any accommodation **on indefinite hold**. The U-S is currently aligned with Israel and the Gulf in containing, not courting, Tehran.\n\n3. **Future prospects:** Structural incentives (freeing U-S resources for China containment, stabilising Hormuz, preventing a Russo-Sino-Iranian bloc) mean the *logic* behind Friedman\u2019s forecast is **not dead**, merely **delayed and complicated**. A credible path back to talks would require:\n   * a verified pause in Iran\u2019s nuclear rebuild,\n   * a face-saving mechanism for Israel and the Gulf,\n   * and U-S willingness to grant Iran limited regional prestige without nuclear arms.\n\n   None of those conditions looks likely **while bombs are still falling**, but they could re-emerge once the smoke clears and all sides recalculate costs.\n\n**In short:** Friedman\u2019s maxim about \u201csupping with the devil\u201d remains a structurally sound piece of realist counsel\u2014but, after June 2025, it is *temporarily* overtaken by events. Whether it revives will depend less on philosophical realism in Washington than on how far Tehran, Moscow and Beijing deepen their own strategic embrace."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":549,"end_idx":566,"safe_urls":["https://sobrief.com/books/the-next-decade"],"refs":[],"alt":"([sobrief.com](https://sobrief.com/books/the-next-decade))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Next Decade | Summary, Quotes, FAQ, Audio","url":"https://sobrief.com/books/the-next-decade","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"sobrief.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn5search8\ue201","start_idx":1160,"end_idx":1205,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/article/world/interim-nuclear-agreement-between-iran-and-six-powers-idUSBRE9AN0FS/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/article/world/tough-road-lies-ahead-after-landmark-iran-nuclear-deal-idUSBRE9AI0CV/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/interim-nuclear-agreement-between-iran-and-six-powers-idUSBRE9AN0FS/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/tough-road-lies-ahead-after-landmark-iran-nuclear-deal-idUSBRE9AI0CV/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Interim nuclear agreement between Iran and six powers | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/interim-nuclear-agreement-between-iran-and-six-powers-idUSBRE9AN0FS/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1385251200.0,"snippet":"Iran and six world powers struck a deal on Sunday under which Tehran is to limit its nuclear energy program in exchange for initial relief ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"reuters.com"},{"title":"Tough road lies ahead after landmark Iran nuclear deal | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/tough-road-lies-ahead-after-landmark-iran-nuclear-deal-idUSBRE9AI0CV/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1385337600.0,"snippet":"GENEVA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has pulled off a historic deal with Iran on curbing its nuclear program but he and other global ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"reuters.com"},{"title":"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749147352.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn9news4\ue201","start_idx":1615,"end_idx":1632,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/oman-confirms-next-round-us-iran-nuclear-talks-amid-fears-regional-risks-2025-06-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/oman-confirms-next-round-us-iran-nuclear-talks-amid-fears-regional-risks-2025-06-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Oman confirms next round of US-Iran nuclear talks amid fears of regional risks","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/oman-confirms-next-round-us-iran-nuclear-talks-amid-fears-regional-risks-2025-06-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749714250.0,"snippet":"The sixth round of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks will take place in Muscat, Oman, this Sunday, confirmed by Omani officials. President Trump emphasized that Tehran must not obtain a nuclear weapon, reinforcing U.S. resolve amid heightened regional tensions. The U.S. has begun evacuating non-essential personnel from its embassy in Iraq and authorized voluntary departures from other Middle Eastern locations, including Bahrain and Kuwait, due to unspecified security threats. These moves have pushed oil prices up temporarily and raised fears of regional escalation. Meanwhile, Iran's defense minister warned the U.S. that Iranian forces would target regional American bases if provoked. Intelligence suggests growing concern over possible Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear installations, and British maritime authorities have advised caution for ships transiting critical waterways near Iran. Despite the tensions, foreign energy operations in Iraq continue unaffected. The situation reflects persistent volatility following the Gaza war's onset in 2023 and ongoing attacks by Iran-aligned groups in Iraq, although such attacks have decreased recently.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"reuters.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3news9\ue202turn6news10\ue201","start_idx":1842,"end_idx":1871,"safe_urls":["https://www.barrons.com/articles/israel-goes-to-war-without-trump-the-u-s-may-be-drawn-in-anyway-51e928ec?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-seeks-distance-us-israeli-strikes-iran-2025-06-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/israel-goes-to-war-without-trump-the-u-s-may-be-drawn-in-anyway-51e928ec?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-seeks-distance-us-israeli-strikes-iran-2025-06-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Israel Goes to War Without Trump.

This marked a dramatic escalation in Middle East tensions and ended ongoing diplomatic talks concerning Iran's near-complete nuclear program. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation aimed to neutralize Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities and could continue indefinitely. Despite Donald Trump's past promises to restore Middle East stability and his current stance favoring diplomacy, the Trump administration distanced itself from Israel's unilateral action, emphasizing the safety of American forces. Nonetheless, the conflict risks drawing the U.S. into the fray due to longstanding alliances with Israel and regional partners like Saudi Arabia. The geopolitical shake-up immediately impacted financial markets, triggering sharp rises in oil prices and drops in stock futures, although Iran\u2019s oil facilities were not initially targeted. Analysts warn of significant global repercussions if the situation escalates, especially if the United States becomes actively involved in the conflict.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"barrons.com"},{"title":"Trump administration seeks to distance US from Israeli strikes on Iran","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-seeks-distance-us-israeli-strikes-iran-2025-06-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749788857.0,"snippet":"The Trump administration is seeking to distance the United States from recent Israeli strikes on Iran amid ongoing diplomatic attempts to negotiate a nuclear deal with Tehran.

The timing of the attacks complicates ongoing nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, with another round of talks planned for Sunday in Oman. While President Trump has publicly favored a diplomatic resolution, he acknowledged the potential for military conflict, stating Iran must provide more in negotiations. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in nearly two decades. Tensions have escalated, with the U.S. relocating personnel from the Middle East and issuing warnings to Iran against targeting American interests.
