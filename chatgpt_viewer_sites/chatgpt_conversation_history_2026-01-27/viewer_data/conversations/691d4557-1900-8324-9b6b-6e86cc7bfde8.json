What returns do you need to file, and when?\n\nYou have **two regulators** to think about:\n\n- **ACRA** = Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (companies law / annual return).\n- **IRAS** = Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (corporate income tax).\n\n### 1A. ACRA \u2013 Companies Act obligations\n\n**(i) Annual Return (AR)**  \n\n- All \u201clive\u201d companies **must** file an Annual Return, even if they are inactive or dormant. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n- As a **private company**, your AR is due **within 7 months after FYE**. With FYE 31 Dec 2025, your first AR is due **by 31 July 2026**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search10\ue201  \n\nWhen you file that AR on BizFile+:\n\n- You\u2019ll indicate that the company is **dormant**.\n- You\u2019ll declare whether it qualifies as a **\u201cprivate dormant relevant company\u201d** (dormant, unlisted, not a subsidiary of a listed company, and total assets \u2264 S$500,000). \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n  - In your situation (new company, no transactions, no assets beyond small paid-up capital), you almost certainly meet these thresholds.\n\nIf you are a **private dormant relevant company**, you are:\n\n- Automatically **exempt from audit**, and  \n- **Exempt from preparing financial statements** if the directors file the required dormancy declaration, and  \n- **Exempt from holding AGMs** (Annual General Meetings), subject to safeguards (a shareholder can still demand one). \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn3search2\ue201  \n\n**(ii) Financial statements / audit**\n\n- A dormant company is exempt from **audit**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \n- It is also exempt from **preparing financial statements** if it is:\n  - Unlisted;\n  - Not a subsidiary of a listed company; and\n  - Total assets \u2264 S$500,000; and\n  - Dormant since formation or the end of the previous financial year; **and**\n  - The directors lodge a dormancy declaration. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search2\ue201  \n\nIn practice, this declaration is made via the AR (BizFile+ will prompt for it); there is no separate standalone form.\n\n---\n\n### 1B. IRAS \u2013 Corporate income tax\n\n#### (a) Years of Assessment (YA) for a new company like yours\n\nYou were **incorporated in 2024** and your **first set of accounts closes in 2025** (FYE 31 Dec 2025). IRAS\u2019 guidance explicitly says:\n\n> If a company is incorporated in 2024 and closes its first set of accounts in 2025, **no filing is required for YA 2025**. The company\u2019s **first filing will be for YA 2026**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\nSo:\n\n- **YA 2025** \u2013 no corporate tax return at all for you.\n- **YA 2026** \u2013 your **first** corporate income tax filing.\n\n#### (b) Corporate Income Tax Return\n\nFor **YA 2026** (basis period = 1 Jan 2025 to 31 Dec 2025, with the 2024 stub period dealt with internally by IRAS), you have been **dormant**: no business, no income.\n\nIRAS defines a **dormant company** as one that has **no business and no income** for the whole basis period. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n\nBy default, a dormant company must file its **Corporate Income Tax Return** by **30 November each year**, using the simplified **\u201cForm for Dormant Company\u201d** (2 essential fields, 5-minute filing) unless IRAS has granted a waiver. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\nFor you, that means:\n\n- **YA 2026 Corporate Tax Return (\u201cForm for Dormant Company\u201d) is due by 30 Nov 2026**, unless you obtain a waiver.\n\n#### (c) Optionally: apply for IRAS waiver (if you intend to stay dormant)\n\nIRAS allows a newly incorporated company that has been dormant from incorporation and expects to remain dormant for at least two more years to apply for a **waiver from filing future corporate tax returns**. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n\n- If you are confident the company will remain dormant for at least the next **2 years**, it is worth applying for this waiver via myTax Portal.  \n- Once granted, IRAS **stops issuing Form C-S/Form C/Form for Dormant Company** from the effective YA onwards.\n\nIf you later start business or receive income, you must **notify IRAS within 1 month** to resume filing. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n\n#### (d) Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI)\n\nEstimated Chargeable Income (ECI) must normally be filed **within 3 months after FYE**. However, IRAS waives ECI filing if **both** conditions hold: \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search2\ue201  \n\n1. Annual revenue \u2264 **S$5 million**, and  \n2. ECI = **S$0**.\n\nYou are dormant with zero revenue and zero income, so you **automatically qualify** for ECI waiver for FYE 31 Dec 2025 (YA 2026). No ECI filing is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Is this considered your first year of operation?\n\nYou need to separate three notions:\n\n1. **Financial year**  \n   - From an accounting/Companies Act perspective, your **first financial year** runs from your incorporation date in Sept 2024 to **31 Dec 2025** (15\u201316 months). ACRA is fine with a first financial year up to 18 months. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201  \n\n2. **Operational status**  \n   - You have **not commenced business and have no income**, so in ordinary language you **have not yet started operations**.\n\n3. **Tax Years of Assessment (YA)**  \n   - Technically your **first YA** is **YA 2025**, because YA 2025 corresponds to the basis period including your incorporation date in 2024. But because your **first accounts close in 2025**, IRAS doesn\u2019t make you file anything for YA 2025 and starts with **YA 2026** as your first actual filing. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\nSo:\n\n- **Yes**, this 2024\u20132025 period is your **first financial year**,  \n- But **no**, you are **not yet in a \u201cyear of operation\u201d** for tax purposes \u2013 you are treated as **dormant** until you begin business or earn income.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Do you need to create and file notification for an AGM?\n\nShort answer: **No, you do not file any AGM notice with ACRA.**\n\nAGM (Annual General Meeting) rules:\n\n- Default: a private company must hold its AGM **within 6 months after FYE** (so by **30 Jun 2026** for FYE 31 Dec 2025). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n- However, under the **\u201cno AGM\u201d regime** and **dormant relevant company** rules:\n\n  1. **Private companies** are exempted from holding AGMs if they send financial statements to members within 5 months after FYE and no member demands an AGM. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n  2. **Private dormant relevant companies** (dormant, unlisted, not a subsidiary of a listed company, total assets \u2264 S$500,000) **do not need to hold any AGM at all**, subject to a member\u2019s right to request one. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n\nIn your situation:\n\n- You are very likely a **private dormant relevant company**.  \n- That means **no AGM is required** unless a shareholder explicitly requests it.  \n- You **do not lodge any AGM notice** or minutes with ACRA; you only keep any internal resolutions/records in your company minute book.\n\nWhen you eventually file the AR, you\u2019ll select the appropriate option in BizFile+ (e.g. AGM not required due to dormancy / dispensation).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Do you need to make any \u201cgeneral lodgements\u201d?\n\nBeyond:\n\n- **Annual Return with ACRA** (by 31 Jul 2026), and  \n- **Corporate Income Tax obligations with IRAS** (Form for Dormant Company by 30 Nov 2026 unless waived),\n\nthere are **no extra recurring \u201cgeneral lodgements\u201d** purely because time passes or because the company is dormant.\n\nYou only need to lodge things with ACRA if there are **changes**, for example: \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn1search12\ue201  \n\n- Appointment/resignation of directors or company secretary  \n- Change of registered office address  \n- Changes to share capital or shareholdings  \n- Amendments to the constitution  \n\nIf nothing has changed and you remain dormant, there is nothing else to file on a routine basis.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Do you need to notify ACRA that the business is dormant?\n\n**There is no separate \u201cdormant\u201d status filing with ACRA at the moment of becoming dormant.**\n\nInstead:\n\n- ACRA\u2019s definition of a **dormant company** is based on **no accounting transactions** during the financial year, ignoring certain maintenance transactions (share subscription on incorporation, appointment of secretary, payment of ACRA fees, nominal sums \u2264 S$5,000, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \n- When you file your **Annual Return**, you will:\n  - Declare that the company is **dormant**; and  \n  - Lodge the **director\u2019s dormancy statement** if you want exemption from preparing financial statements as a private dormant relevant company. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search7\ue201  \n\nThere is **no separate BizFile+ transaction now** to mark the company \u201cdormant\u201d; you simply report it correctly in your first AR and keep your internal director\u2019s statement.\n\n(Separate point: if you want IRAS to stop sending tax returns while you stay dormant, *that* does require a waiver application to IRAS \u2013 but that is tax, not ACRA. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Clean timeline for your case\n\nAssuming you stay fully dormant through 31 Dec 2025:\n\n- **By 31 Mar 2026** \u2013 ECI  \n  - No ECI filing needed (revenue 0 and ECI 0 \u2192 qualifies for automatic ECI waiver). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search2\ue201  \n\n- **By 30 Jun 2026** \u2013 AGM  \n  - As a private dormant relevant company, no AGM is required unless a shareholder requests one. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n\n- **By 31 Jul 2026** \u2013 ACRA Annual Return  \n  - File AR via BizFile+, declare dormancy and (if applicable) claim exemption as a private dormant relevant company. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n\n- **By 30 Nov 2026** \u2013 IRAS Corporate Income Tax (YA 2026)  \n  - Either file \u201cForm for Dormant Company\u201d as a dormant company, or, if approved, rely on IRAS\u2019 waiver so that no return is required. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### One caveat\n\nThis is based on your description of **no business, no income, no expenses** and no other assets. If, in reality, you have any non-trivial transactions (e.g. rental income, interest income, substantial bank charges, investments, employees), the dormancy status and obligations can change. In that case you should get a local accountant or corporate service provider to review the actual ledger.\n\nIf you like, next step we can sanity-check specific transactions (if any) to make sure they don\u2019t accidentally break dormancy under ACRA or IRAS definitions."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201","start_idx":647,"end_idx":664,"safe_urls":["https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/what-you-have-to-file-each-year"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Default](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/what-you-have-to-file-each-year))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"\n\tWhat you have to file each year\n","url":"https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/what-you-have-to-file-each-year","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Default"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search10\ue201","start_idx":805,"end_idx":838,"safe_urls":["https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/deciding-on-a-financial-year-end","https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/deciding-on-a-financial-year-end?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/what-you-have-to-file-each-year","https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/what-you-have-to-file-each-year?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Default](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/deciding-on-a-financial-year-end?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Deciding on a Financial Year End","url":"https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company/deciding-on-a-financial-year-end?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"A financial year end (FYE) is the final day of an accounting period, which can be 12 months or 52 weeks.

How IRAS treats newly incorporated 2024 companies\n\nFrom IRAS\u2019 own Form C-S / C-S (Lite) FAQ:\n\n> \u201cFor newly incorporated companies (i.e. companies incorporated in the year 2024)\u2026 a newly incorporated company is due to file its first tax return **2 years after the year of its incorporation i.e. YA 2026**. Hence, there is **no outstanding filing record for YA 2025** at the \u2018Filing Summary\u2019 page.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n\nThey then add an **exception**:\n\n> If the company **closed its first set of financial statements in the year of incorporation and commenced business or received any income** in that year (here: 2024), it must proactively request an income tax return for YA 2025. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn4view1\ue201  \n\nYour situation:\n\n- Incorporated: **Sept 2024**  \n- First financial year end: **31 Dec 2025** (first and only FYE so far)  \n- No business, **no income**, no expenses  \n- First set of accounts closes **in 2025**, **not** in 2024  \n\nSo you are firmly in the **default** case:\n\n- **No Form C-S / C-S (Lite) / C or \u201cForm for Dormant Company\u201d is required at all in 2025.**  \n- Your **first Corporate Income Tax Return** (for Year of Assessment (YA) 2026) only becomes due **by 30 Nov 2026**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue202turn6search3\ue201  \n\nThat first return is where you will **declare that the company is dormant** (no business, no income in the basis period).\n\n---\n\n## 2. What about \u201cdormant companies must file every year\u201d?\n\nOn the IRAS \u201cDormant Companies\u201d page, they state:\n\n> \u201cA dormant company must file its Corporate Income Tax Return by 30 Nov every year unless the company has been granted a waiver\u2026\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n\nThat sentence is **general** \u2013 it assumes the company is already in the normal annual filing cycle.\n\nFor **newly incorporated companies**, IRAS explicitly overrides this with the \u201cfirst return 2 years after incorporation\u201d rule above. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn4view1\ue201  \n\nSo:\n\n- Conceptually, you **are** a dormant company for YA 2025 (basis period: 2024 stub), but  \n- **Procedurally**, IRAS does **not** ask you to file any return for YA 2025 because you are a **2024-incorporated company with first accounts closing in 2025 and no income**.\n\nThey only start pulling you into the regular \u201cfile every year unless waived\u201d regime from **YA 2026** onwards.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI) in 2025?\n\nEstimated Chargeable Income (ECI) is IRAS\u2019 early estimate return, usually due **within 3 months of financial year end**. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search3\ue201  \n\nFor you:\n\n- Financial year end (FYE): **31 Dec 2025**  \n- So the **first possible** ECI deadline is **31 Mar 2026**, not 2025.  \n\nOn top of that, IRAS\u2019 ECI waiver rule says:\n\n> You do **not** need to file ECI if **ECI is nil** and **annual revenue \u2264 S\\$5 million**. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search3\ue201  \n\nYou have zero revenue and zero income, so:\n\n- **No ECI filing in 2025** (because your FYE is 31 Dec 2025), and  \n- **No ECI filing in 2026 either**, because you meet the ECI waiver conditions for YA 2026.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Does IRAS need to be told you are dormant *before* 2026?\n\nNo, you **do not** have any obligation in 2025 to \u201cpre-declare\u201d dormancy to IRAS.\n\nIRAS recognises dormancy **via the return**:\n\n- On your **first Corporate Income Tax Return** (YA 2026, due 30 Nov 2026), you file using the **\u201cForm for Dormant Company\u201d** if you still have no business and no income. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- If you expect to remain dormant for **at least the next 2 years**, you may *optionally* apply in advance for a **waiver from future returns** \u2013 IRAS explicitly allows newly incorporated dormant companies to do this. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n\nBut that waiver is **optional extra admin relief**; it is **not** a prerequisite to avoid 2025 filings. You are already off the hook for 2025 by virtue of being a 2024-incorporated company with no 2024 accounts and no income.\n\n---\n\n## 5. ACRA in 2025 (for completeness)\n\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA):\n\n- Your **first Annual Return** is due **within 7 months after FYE 31 Dec 2025**, i.e. by **31 Jul 2026**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue201  \n- There is **no ACRA filing at all in 2025** in your fact pattern.  \n- When you file that first Annual Return, you can then **declare the company dormant** under the Companies Act dormancy rules.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nGiven:\n\n- Incorporated in **2024**,  \n- First financial year ends **31 Dec 2025**,  \n- **No business, no income, no expenses** through 2024 and 2025,\n\nthen:\n\n- **You do not file any Corporate Income Tax Return or ECI with IRAS in 2025.**  \n- IRAS will only expect your **first** tax return (which you can file as a dormant
