The past decade and a half saw large inflows of asylum seekers and refugees, alongside continued labor migration. These movements peaked during the *\u201crefugee crisis\u201d* of 2015\u20132016, when conflict-driven displacement from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and other regions pushed asylum applications in Europe to record levels\u30105\u2020L100-L107\u3011. The surge exposed deep divisions in how European countries respond to migrants: some nations embraced newcomers under humanitarian principles, while others tightened borders and asylum rules\u30106\u2020L201-L209\u3011. In subsequent years, immigration trends have evolved with new challenges \u2013 from irregular Mediterranean crossings to the 2022 exodus of refugees from Ukraine \u2013 prompting ongoing policy debates across the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia. This report provides a comprehensive overview of these immigration trends, the key drivers behind migration to Europe, the policy responses in different countries, as well as public sentiment and the socio-economic impacts of immigration.\n\n## Immigration Trends in Europe (2010\u20132025)\n\n\u301038\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Annual number of asylum applications in Europe (EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland), 1985\u20132015. The 2015\u20132016 period saw an unprecedented spike to about 1.3 million asylum seekers, far exceeding any prior post-World War II peak.*  \n\n**Rising Asylum Flows:** Immigration to Europe accelerated in the 2010s, primarily due to a sharp rise in asylum seekers fleeing war and instability. In the wake of the Arab Spring and the Syrian civil war, asylum applications in the EU climbed steadily and **peaked in 2015\u20132016 at over 2.5 million** (cumulative), the highest on record\u30105\u2020L100-L107\u3011. In 2015 alone, about **1.3 million people** (mostly from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq) applied for asylum in EU countries (plus Norway and Switzerland) \u2013 nearly double the previous early-1990s peak\u301036\u2020L141-L149\u3011\u301036\u2020L151-L159\u3011. This massive influx dropped in the following years to around 500,000 annual asylum applications by 2017\u20132018\u30105\u2020L100-L107\u3011. However, flows began rising again toward the end of the decade: by 2021 the EU received ~692,000 asylum requests, roughly *three times the volume of 2010*\u30105\u2020L100-L107\u3011. Recent data show another surge in asylum seekers in the early 2020s, approaching **1 million applications in 2023**, before a slight dip in 2024\u301026\u2020L201-L209\u3011. These figures underscore that refugee and asylum migration remain significant and volatile, responding to global conflict trends.\n\n**Major Origin Regions:** The composition of asylum seekers since 2010 has been dominated by people escaping conflict zones and repressive states. Over the period 2010\u20132021, the top countries of origin for asylum applicants in Europe included **Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq** (by far the largest groups), followed by others like Pakistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Nigeria, Russia, and the Western Balkans\u30104\u2020L1-L9\u3011. At the height of the crisis in 2015, about half of asylum seekers arriving were from **Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq**, reflecting the wars and instability in those countries\u301036\u2020L151-L159\u3011. Subsequent peaks in asylum numbers have corresponded with flare-ups of violence or hardship (for example, renewed conflict in Afghanistan in 2021, turmoil in parts of Africa, etc.). In addition to conflict refugees, Europe also received asylum applicants fleeing persecution in authoritarian states (e.g. Eritrea) and those escaping terrorism or state collapse in countries like Somalia and Libya. The **demographics** of these asylum flows skewed young: over half of asylum seekers in 2015 were adults aged 18\u201334\u301037\u2020L21-L24\u3011, and a significant share were unaccompanied minors in some countries during the crisis years. \n\n**Uneven Distribution Across Countries:** Importantly, these inflows were distributed very unevenly among European host countries. A handful of nations shouldered a disproportionate share of asylum applications. Germany became the primary destination from 2012 onward, receiving **442,000 asylum applications in 2015 alone**\u301036\u2020L159-L167\u3011 as Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a policy of openness (\u201c*Wir schaffen das*,\u201d or \u201cWe can manage this\u201d). Other Western European countries like **Sweden** also took on large numbers in proportion to their population \u2013 Sweden received **163,000 asylum seekers in 2015**, the most per capita of any EU country that year\u301026\u2020L191-L199\u3011. By contrast, some countries saw relatively few asylum arrivals; for example, the **United Kingdom** registered about **39,000 applications in 2015** (similar to previous years)\u301036\u2020L159-L167\u3011, constituting only around 3% of all asylum claims in Europe\u301023\u2020L248-L256\u3011. \n\n\u301039\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Asylum applications per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015 for selected European countries, illustrating the unequal per capita burden. Hungary and Sweden topped the list with roughly 1,600\u20131,770 asylum seekers per 100,000 people, vastly exceeding the European average (250 per 100k), while France and the UK were far below average.*  \n\nSeveral smaller frontline countries experienced extreme spikes during 2015\u20132016. **Hungary**, for instance, recorded *174,000* asylum applications in 2015 (before largely sealing its borders), which translated to an EU-high **1,770 asylum seekers per 100,000 residents**\u301036\u2020L167-L175\u3011. Sweden had about **1,600 per 100,000** in population, and others like **Austria** (1,000 per 100k) and **Norway** (600 per 100k) also far exceeded the EU-wide average of ~250 per 100k people\u301036\u2020L167-L175\u3011. In contrast, larger countries such as **France** and the **UK** saw only *110* and *60 asylum seekers per 100,000* inhabitants, respectively, in 2015\u301036\u2020L169-L175\u3011. Southern European entry points like **Italy** and **Greece** likewise had lower asylum application rates per capita (many migrants transited onward rather than claim asylum there). This imbalance created tension within the EU, as frontline and generous host states felt overwhelmed while other member states (especially in Eastern Europe) accepted relatively few refugees.\n\n**Shifts in Routes and Volume:** The overall volume of irregular migration to Europe also fluctuated after 2015 due to policy measures and shifting routes. EU cooperation with Turkey in 2016 sharply reduced the Aegean Sea crossings into Greece\u301021\u2020L680-L688\u3011, and the closure of the Balkan land route likewise curbed flows by 2017. However, migrants continued to attempt other paths, such as the **Central Mediterranean route** to Italy (often via Libya) and routes into Spain. These journeys resulted in a tragic loss of life \u2013 over **3,700 migrant deaths in the Mediterranean in 2015** alone, the deadliest year on record\u301011\u2020L17-L24\u3011 \u2013 and became a focal point of European media coverage and policy enforcement. By 2019, asylum numbers had risen again modestly, indicating persistent pressures. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a brief dip in migration (due to travel restrictions), but flows rebounded quickly thereafter. \n\n**Ukrainian Refugee Influx (2022):** A unique and massive displacement event occurred in 2022 with Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This triggered the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Within months, millions of Ukrainians (mostly women and children) fled to neighboring European countries. The EU responded by, for the first time, *activating its Temporary Protection Directive* \u2013 an emergency mechanism granting Ukrainians collective protection and residency rights without a full asylum process\u30108\u2020L139-L148\u3011. As a result, Europe absorbed a very large number of Ukrainian refugees in a short period: as of late 2023, **over 4.2 million people from Ukraine** were living in the EU under temporary protection status\u30108\u2020L151-L159\u3011. Major host countries include **Germany (~1.24 million Ukrainians)**, **Poland (~955,000)**, and **Czechia (~369,000)**, among others\u30108\u2020L158-L166\u3011. The Ukraine crisis was notable for the broad welcome given to these refugees across Europe, in contrast to the often contentious reception of Middle Eastern and African asylum seekers in prior years. It also significantly impacted immigration statistics \u2013 for example, in 2022 the total number of immigrants to countries like Poland and Germany reached record highs due to the influx of Ukrainians. While Ukrainian refugees were not counted as asylum applicants (since they received temporary protection), their arrival tested Europe\u2019s capacity for refugee support and integration on an unprecedented scale.\n\n**Continued Labor Migration and Other Flows:** Aside from asylum seekers and refugees, Europe has remained a major destination for labor migrants, family reunification migrants, and students. Throughout the 2010s, **low-skilled migrant workers** from outside the EU filled critical jobs in agriculture, construction, care services, and hospitality across Western Europe\u301040\u2020L201-L209\u3011. For example, by the 2020s an estimated **22% of agricultural workers in the EU** were non-EU immigrants\u301040\u2020L203-L211\u3011, indicating heavy reliance on foreign labor for essential but often low-paid work. Many of these migrants arrived through irregular channels or temporary/seasonal work programs, as the EU\u2019s legal migration system offered few avenues for low-skilled migration. In parallel, Europe also attracted **high-skilled professionals** \u2013 e.g. engineers, IT specialists, doctors \u2013 especially to countries like the UK and Germany that actively recruited global talent\u301040\u2020L218-L226\u3011. By 2021, over *50% of the high-skilled tech workforce* in some European countries consisted of immigrants\u301040\u2020L220-L228\u3011. Furthermore, freedom of movement within the EU meant ongoing internal migration (e.g. workers from Eastern Europe moving to wealthier member states). All these streams contributed to a growing foreign-born population. As of 2020, about **87 million international migrants lived in Europe**, up 16% from 2015\u301014\u2020L1-L8\u3011. Roughly half of these were people born in one European country living in another, while the other half \u2013 **over 40 million** \u2013 were born outside Europe\u301016\u2020L21-L23\u3011. In sum, Europe\u2019s migrant population has continued to expand, driven by both humanitarian inflows and economic migration, even as policies have become more restrictive.\n\n## Key Drivers of Migration to Europe\n\nMigration to Europe in the 2010\u20132025 period has been propelled by a combination of **push factors** (forces driving people out of origin countries) and **pull factors** (attractions drawing them to Europe). The most important drivers include:\n\n- **Violent Conflict and Persecution:** War and insecurity have been the single biggest catalyst of mass migration into Europe. The Syrian civil war (starting 2011) alone displaced millions, with hundreds of thousands seeking asylum in Europe\u30105\u2020L94-L102\u3011. Likewise, protracted conflict and Taliban insurgency in **Afghanistan**, ongoing violence in **Iraq**, civil war in **Somalia**, repression in **Eritrea**, and the rise of groups like Boko Haram in **Nigeria** all created refugees who fled toward Europe. By 2015, fresh or long-running conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq accounted for about half of Europe\u2019s asylum seekers\u301036\u2020L151-L159\u3011. People escaping **political persecution** and human rights abuses \u2013 for example, dissidents from authoritarian regimes or minority groups facing violence \u2013 have also been a steady flow. Overall, studies confirm that surges in European asylum applications correlate strongly with outbreaks of civil war and severe repression in origin countries\u301021\u2020L739-L747\u3011. These migrants are *push-driven*: they flee for survival, not for economic opportunity.\n\n- **Economic Hardship and Lack of Opportunities:** Many migrants are also motivated by chronic poverty, unemployment, and hopeless economic conditions in their home countries. Large income disparities between developing regions and Europe act as a powerful **pull factor**, as individuals pursue better livelihoods. For instance, numerous young men from West Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East embarked on perilous journeys to Europe in the 2010s, not directly because of war, but because of **economic desperation** and the dream of a decent job. Research shows that the *income gap* between Europe and Africa or the Middle East is a significant predictor of migration flows\u301018\u2020L225-L233\u3011. Paradoxically, as some poorer countries experience moderate economic growth, emigration can initially *increase* \u2013 improved incomes enable more people to afford the trip abroad, a trend observed in parts of Africa\u301018\u2020L231-L239\u3011. In short, persistent global inequalities in wealth and employment prospects have been a structural driver of migration to Europe.\n\n- **Demographic and Social Factors:** Demographic pressures also play a role. Many origin countries in Africa and South Asia have rapidly growing, youthful populations with few local opportunities, creating a surplus of potential migrants. Europe, conversely, has an aging population and demand for workers (discussed below). This **demographic imbalance** forms a push-pull dynamic: young migrants from populous countries are drawn to Europe\u2019s labor markets and aging societies in need of rejuvenation\u301018\u2020L251-L259\u3011. Additionally, the presence of **diaspora communities** and established migrant networks in Europe facilitates further migration. For example, the large Iraqi and Somali diasporas in countries like Sweden and Finland were a pull factor for new asylum seekers from those countries in 2015\u301032\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u301032\u2020L185-L193\u3011. Family ties and communities abroad often influence destination choice.\n\n- **Climate Change and Environmental Stress:** Environmental factors have begun to contribute to migration movements, often indirectly. **Climate change**\u2013induced phenomena such as prolonged droughts, desertification, crop failures, and natural disasters can exacerbate economic and social instability in regions neighboring Europe\u301018\u2020L225-L233\u3011\u301018\u2020L283-L289\u3011. For instance, some analysts link Syria\u2019s pre-war drought and resulting rural dislocation as one background factor to the conflict (and thus to refugee flows). In Africa\u2019s Sahel region, climate stress on livelihoods may be compounding the pressures driving young people to migrate northward. While climate change typically acts as a *threat multiplier* rather than a sole cause, it is increasingly recognized as a migration driver that will likely grow in significance. People fleeing uninhabitable environments or climate-related disasters (sometimes termed *\u201cclimate refugees\u201d*) have started to appear among those heading to Europe, though international law does not yet recognize climate refugees as a distinct category.\n\n- **Attractions of Europe (Pull Factors):** Europe\u2019s relative peace, prosperity, and stability have long exerted a pull on migrants worldwide. The prospect of **safety and asylum protections**, access to jobs and higher wages, education and welfare benefits, and respect for human rights draws many to try to reach European soil. During the 2015 refugee crisis, Germany\u2019s and Sweden\u2019s reputation for generous asylum policies attracted asylum seekers to those countries\u30106\u2020L206-L209\u3011. Moreover, smugglers often advertise Europe as an El Dorado to would-be migrants. The presence of **liberal democratic values** and established immigrant communities can also be pull factors \u2013 for example, Europe\u2019s openness to *providing refuge* for those fleeing persecution (rooted in the 1951 Refugee Convention) is itself a draw for people in danger. That said, Europe\u2019s pull factors have been counterbalanced by increasing barriers to entry, as discussed in the next section.\n\nLooking ahead, many of these drivers are expected to persist. A recent study concluded that as long as large **gaps in income, governance, and security** remain between Europe and its neighboring regions, significant migration pressure will continue\u301018\u2020L251-L259\u3011. Aging populations in Europe will also sustain a demand for migrant labor, attracting young workers from abroad\u301018\u2020L253-L258\u3011. In sum, conflict and repression push people out, while economic opportunity and safety pull them in \u2013 a dynamic that has defined Europe\u2019s migration story in the 2010s and beyond.\n\n## Immigration Policy Responses in Europe\n\nEuropean countries have adopted a wide range of policy responses to manage immigration since 2010, often revealing stark differences in approach. Below we examine the responses at both the EU level and in individual countries or regions (EU member states, the UK, and Scandinavia), with a focus on policies affecting asylum seekers, refugees, and low-skilled labor migrants.\n\n### EU-Wide Actions and Agreements\n\nAt the European Union level, the 2015\u20132016 crisis was a stress test for the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) and prompted several collective initiatives \u2013 albeit with mixed success. The **Dublin Regulation**, which stipulates that the first EU country of entry is responsible for an asylum claim, proved problematic when frontline states like Greece and Italy were overwhelmed\u30106\u2020L191-L199\u3011\u30106\u2020L195-L203\u3011. In response, EU institutions attempted emergency measures: for example, in 2015 the EU proposed a **refugee relocation quota** scheme to redistribute asylum seekers from heavily burdened countries to others. This *resettlement programme* aimed to share responsibility more evenly across the Union\u30106\u2020L187-L195\u3011. However, the implementation largely faltered in the face of opposition from some governments, and the quota system relocated only a small fraction of the intended numbers. Simultaneously, the EU set up \u201c**hotspots**\u201d \u2013 reception and registration centers in front-line states (notably Greece and Italy) \u2013 to more efficiently process arrivals and coordinate support\u30106\u2020L187-L195\u3011. While helpful in identification and fingerprinting, the hotspot approach did not resolve broader capacity issues, leaving thousands stuck in squalid camps. \n\nA major focus of EU policy became **border control and external cooperation** to stem irregular inflows. The EU significantly bolstered **Frontex**, its border agency (later reformed into the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in 2016), deploying resources to external borders and the Mediterranean\u301021\u2020L772-L781\u3011\u301021\u2020L774-L782\u3011. Joint naval operations like Italy\u2019s *Mare Nostrum* (2013\u20132014) and the EU\u2019s *Operation Sophia* sought both to rescue migrants at sea and disrupt smuggling networks\u301019\u2020L609-L619\u3011. In March 2016, the EU struck a landmark deal with **Turkey**: Ankara agreed to prevent departures and take back migrants arriving in Greece, in exchange for EU financial aid and other commitments. This *EU-Turkey agreement* quickly reduced the Aegean boat crossings by over 90%\u301021\u2020L680-L688\u3011, effectively ending the acute phase of the crisis in Greece (although leaving many in limbo in Turkish or Libyan camps). Similar externalization efforts included partnering with unstable transit countries like **Libya**: the Italian government in 2017, under Interior Minister Marco Minniti, forged an arrangement with Libyan authorities to interdict migrant boats, supplying the Libyan coast guard with equipment to **\u201cfend Africans away from European waters\u201d**\u301023\u2020L224-L232\u3011. The EU also funded the **Khartoum and Rabat processes** to cooperate with African states on migration control, and increased support for refugee camps in Middle Eastern countries. Collectively, these measures aimed to *\u201cpush the border outwards\u201d*, reducing arrivals via deterrence and containment beyond EU territory.\n\nDespite these steps, attempts to create a truly unified EU asylum policy have struggled. A proposed new *Pact on Migration and Asylum* (introduced in 2020) sought to balance solidarity and responsibility, but disputes over burden-sharing persisted. Eastern member states vehemently opposed mandatory refugee quotas, and even in 2023\u20132024 negotiations continued over reforming the Dublin system. One notable EU law on the books since 2001 is the **Temporary Protection Directive**, designed to provide immediate protection in a mass influx and redistribute those fleeing (it lay dormant during 2015\u20132016 but was finally activated for Ukraine in 2022)\u301021\u2020L779-L787\u3011\u301021\u2020L780-L788\u3011. In summary, at the EU level the response combined **short-term emergency fixes** (relocations, hotspots, Turkey deal) with **incremental longer-term reforms** (border agency upgrade, legislative harmonization). These have strengthened border management but *fell short of a cohesive common asylum system*: by the mid-2020s, Europe still lacks a consensus mechanism to equitably share refugee responsibilities\u30106\u2020L199-L207\u3011\u30106\u2020L201-L209\u3011.\n\n### Western Europe: Germany, France and Others\n\nWestern European nations generally have more developed asylum and integration systems, but they diverged in their responses to the post-2010 influx. **Germany** under Angela Merkel took a famously welcoming stance in 2015, suspending Dublin transfers for Syrian refugees and affirming moral responsibility to protect those fleeing war. Germany ended up accepting by far the largest number of refugees (over 1 million during 2015\u20132016, when including those redistributed from other EU states)\u301036\u2020L159-L167\u3011. This policy was rooted in humanitarian principles and Germany\u2019s historical memory, and Merkel summed it up with her mantra \u201c*We can manage this*.\u201d To integrate the newcomers, Germany expanded language courses, job training, and housing support. However, even Germany later tightened certain rules (for instance, declaring more origin countries \u201csafe\u201d to speed up deportations of rejected applicants) as public pressure mounted. **France**, while receiving a steady flow of asylum seekers (roughly 70\u2013100k per year in the mid-2010s\u301036\u2020L159-L167\u3011), maintained a more measured approach \u2013 offering asylum to those deemed eligible but also emphasizing secular integration (e.g. controversial bans on religious symbols) and security screening after terrorist attacks. France participated in EU relocation schemes but only to a limited extent. \n\nOther West European states varied: **Switzerland** and **Austria** (though not EU members in the case of Switzerland) took in significant numbers per capita, with Austria initially accommodating many but later electing a conservative government that enacted stricter controls by 2017. **Benelux** countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) and **Scandinavia** (covered separately below) also grappled with substantial asylum claims relative to population. One common trend in Western Europe post-crisis was a shift from open reception to more restrictive measures by 2016\u20132018 as the political climate changed. Even Merkel\u2019s Germany eventually curtailed family reunification rights temporarily and supported an EU deal to limit inflows. Many western countries expanded the use of **temporary protection status** or subsidiary protection with fewer benefits, rather than full refugee status, to disincentivize future migrants. \n\nCrucially, Western Europe also saw robust **integration programs** alongside border controls. Countries invested in language acquisition, education, and labor market entry for refugees. For example, Germany\u2019s integration courses and apprenticeship initiatives sought to help refugees become self-sufficient. Yet challenges remain with social inclusion and employment \u2013 several years on, a share of the 2015\u201316 cohort is still unemployed or under-employed, though success stories exist as well. Western Europe\u2019s response thus balanced an initial humanitarian openness (especially Germany and Sweden) with a later tightening and a sustained effort to integrate those allowed to stay.\n\n### Southern Europe: Italy, Greece and Spain\n\nSouthern EU member states form the **main entry points** for irregular migration by sea. Countries like **Italy** and **Greece** faced intense pressure during the mid-2010s as hundreds of thousands arrived on their shores. Greece, already struggling with economic crisis, became the landing spot for nearly 1 million migrants (mostly Syrian) who crossed from Turkey in 2015 before the Balkan route closed. Overcrowded camps on Greek islands like Lesbos (e.g. the infamous Moria camp) highlighted the humanitarian and logistical strain. Greece\u2019s policy was largely to act as a transit country \u2013 most refugees aimed to move on to Germany or Sweden, and Greece coordinated with the EU for relocation and hosted EU asylum support teams. After the EU-Turkey deal in 2016, the Aegean flow dropped, but thousands remained stuck in Greece under grim conditions, awaiting asylum decisions or return.\n\n**Italy**, on the other hand, bore the brunt of the Central Mediterranean route. The Italian Navy and coast guard, through operations like Mare Nostrum, rescued tens of thousands at sea\u301019\u2020L615-L619\u3011. Italy initially kept ports open to humanitarian rescue ships and worked with EU partners for support. However, feeling abandoned by northern EU states who were reluctant to share the burden, Italian politics shifted. By 2018, Italy elected a populist government in which interior minister **Matteo Salvini** took a hard line: ports were closed to NGO rescue vessels, and a securitized stance was adopted (detaining migrants and pushing for returns). Notably, the seeds of this approach were planted earlier \u2013 Italy\u2019s 2017 cooperation with Libya under a center-left government (Minniti\u2019s deal) was essentially outsourcing border control\u301023\u2020L224-L232\u3011. These policies reduced arrivals (Libyan interceptions meant far fewer boats reached Italy after 2017), but at the cost of severe abuse of migrants in Libyan detention camps, drawing criticism from human rights organizations. Spain experienced a rise in entries via the Western Mediterranean (and into its enclaves Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa), and while it avoided a political crisis on the scale of Italy\u2019s, Spain too increased border enforcement (e.g. fortified fences and faster deportation agreements with Morocco).\n\nIn summary, southern European states have often been caught between *humanitarian responsibilities and limited capacity*. They consistently called for more EU **solidarity** \u2013 financial aid and relocation of refugees \u2013 arguing that EU-wide asylum rules unfairly penalized border countries. Policy responses in the south included building *hotspot* reception centers with EU help, improving asylum processing (Italy and Greece had to reduce huge backlogs), and where possible, trying to relocate migrants to other EU nations (with limited success). More controversially, these states used **deterrence tactics**: Greece has been accused of covert *pushbacks* of asylum seekers at sea and land borders in recent years, and both Italy and Malta have occasionally delayed rescue disembarkations to pressure the EU. Thus, southern Europe\u2019s policy stance has evolved from initially accommodating to increasingly security-focused, under the strain of serving as Europe\u2019s \u201cgatekeepers.\u201d\n\n### Central and Eastern Europe\n\nCountries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) generally took a **much more restrictive stance** on immigration, especially regarding non-European refugees. Many of these nations (e.g. Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia \u2013 the Visegr\u00e1d Group) had little recent history of immigration and, when the 2015 crisis hit, reacted with outright refusal to accept significant numbers of asylum seekers. In 2015, **Hungary**, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, became emblematic of this hardline approach: the government built border fences along Hungary\u2019s southern frontiers with Serbia and Croatia to physically block migrants\u30106\u2020L203-L210\u3011\u30106\u2020L205-L209\u3011. Hungary also criminalized illegal border crossing and aggressively discouraged entry \u2013 by September 2015 it had sealed the Balkan route, forcing migrants to detour. Orb\u00e1n framed the issue as defending Europe from a *\u201cMuslim invasion\u201d*, explicitly rejecting multiculturalism. When the EU proposed mandatory refugee quotas, **Hungary and its Visegr\u00e1d allies flatly rejected them** and launched legal challenges. Indeed, **Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia** admitted almost no asylum seekers through the EU relocation scheme (despite initially being assigned quotas), citing security and cultural concerns. Poland\u2019s new government in 2015 reneged on a pledge to take even a few thousand Syrian refugees, and public opinion in much of Eastern Europe was staunchly against accepting predominantly Muslim migrants.\n\nBeyond refusing arrivals, some CEE governments also passed laws to make their countries unattractive to asylum seekers. **Slovakia** for example said it would only accept Christians (a stance later softened under EU pressure). The **Czech Republic** detained many asylum applicants in prison-like facilities to discourage others. **Bulgaria** and **Slovenia**, though on the transit route, similarly tightened border controls and in Bulgaria\u2019s case, erected a fence on the Turkish border. Many of these states cited their limited resources and lack of experience integrating non-Europeans. There was also a nationalist narrative that migration would threaten their homogenous societies. By closing their doors, these countries shifted the burden back onto Western Europe and the front-line states. \n\nIt is worth noting that Eastern Europe did exhibit openness to certain groups of migrants: notably, when the Ukraine war broke out in 2022, Poland and others took in millions of **Ukrainian refugees** with great generosity. This stark contrast \u2013 *welcoming Christian European neighbors while resisting Middle Eastern or African refugees* \u2013 drew accusations of double standards, which leaders in the region largely acknowledged as a matter of cultural affinity and security perception. In terms of low-skilled labor migration, several CEE countries have actually faced *emigration* of their own citizens and started to accept foreign workers from even poorer countries (e.g. Vietnam, Central Asia) in small numbers to fill gaps, but asylum policy remained extremely strict. Overall, Central and Eastern Europe\u2019s response to immigration from 2010 onwards was characterized by **restriction, securitization, and minimal intake** of asylum seekers. This bloc\u2019s staunch opposition limited the scope of any EU-wide solutions and reflected a powerful current of anti-immigration sentiment in their domestic politics.\n\n### Scandinavia (Northern Europe)\n\nScandinavian countries \u2013 known historically for humanitarianism \u2013 had varied responses, with some dramatic policy reversals. **Sweden** exemplifies this trajectory. Long celebrated as one of Europe\u2019s most welcoming nations, Sweden accepted an enormous number of refugees relative to its size: in 2015 it received **over 160,000 asylum applications**, the highest per capita in the EU\u301026\u2020L191-L199\u3011. This reflected Sweden\u2019s generous asylum rules at the time (permanent residency for many refugees, strong welfare support) and a public ethos of helping the vulnerable. However, the sudden scale of the 2015 influx (which strained housing and services) led to a **U-turn**. By late 2015, Sweden reintroduced **border controls** and in 2016 the government implemented **drastically tighter asylum laws** to deter arrivals\u301026\u2020L209-L217\u3011. These changes included shifting from permanent to **temporary residence permits** for refugees, raising the bar for family reunification, and cutting benefits \u2013 essentially downgrading Sweden\u2019s asylum standards to the EU minimum after decades of more generous practice\u301026\u2020L209-L217\u3011. The political consensus in Sweden moved towards restriction, influenced by the rising anti-immigration Sweden Democrats party. The impact is clear: Sweden went from the EU\u2019s highest per-capita refugee intake to granting asylum to only **6,250 individuals in 2024 \u2013 a 40-year low**\u301026\u2020L168-L176\u3011\u301026\u2020L181-L189\u3011. The Swedish Migration Minister noted that *\u201cthree out of four asylum seekers in Sweden are now rejected\u201d*, emphasizing the tough line\u301026\u2020L195-L203\u3011. In sum, Sweden\u2019s policy shifted from open-door to **\u201cclosed-door\u201d** within a few years, a dramatic paradigm change aimed at achieving what one might call a **\u201clow immigration regime\u201d** by the 2020s.\n\n**Denmark** took an even more hardline approach, arguably Europe\u2019s strictest. For years, Denmark\u2019s governments (across the political spectrum) have pursued a goal of **zero asylum seekers**. A series of measures dubbed the \u201c**paradigm shift**\u201d in Danish asylum policy were introduced, especially after 2015. Denmark was one of the first to temporarily **confiscate valuables** from refugees (the notorious 2016 \u201cjewelry law\u201d) to make them pay for their stay\u301028\u2020L481-L489\u3011. It also delayed family reunifications and repeatedly tightened criteria for permanent residence\u301028\u2020L481-L489\u3011. In 2021, Denmark\u2019s parliament (led by the Social Democrats) passed a law enabling the transfer of **asylum seekers to third countries** outside Europe while their claims are processed\u301028\u2020L421-L430\u3011. The government explicitly negotiated with **Rwanda** as a possible location for an offshore asylum center\u301028\u2020L427-L435\u3011. This radical plan \u2013 essentially copying and extending Australia\u2019s offshore processing model \u2013 marked the first effort of its kind in Europe (though as of 2025 it had not been implemented, pending agreements and legal clarity). Denmark also made headlines by **revoking residence permits of Syrian refugees**, declaring parts of Syria \u201csafe\u201d for return even when most of Europe disagreed\u301028\u2020L443-L450\u3011. The Prime Minister proclaimed that Denmark\u2019s ambition is to receive *\u201czero asylum seekers\u201d* annually\u301028\u2020L451-L459\u3011. These policies, once unthinkable in a country proud of humanitarian traditions, underscore a remarkable shift driven by domestic political pressures. Notably, much of this occurred under a center-left government, illustrating how anti-immigration sentiment penetrated mainstream politics. Denmark today arguably has the most restrictive immigration framework in the EU, including strict integration demands (e.g. mandatory language and values tests, tough citizenship requirements) and enforcement measures that push even accepted refugees to repatriate if conditions improve. \n\n**Norway**, not an EU member but part of the Schengen area, likewise tightened its policies. During the 2015 surge, Norway saw about **31,000 asylum seekers** (large for its population) and responded with *emergency legislation* in November 2015 to curb the inflow\u301030\u2020L154-L163\u3011. The ruling coalition, which included the right-wing Progress Party, gained support through its anti-immigration stance\u301030\u2020L172-L180\u3011. New rules allowed Norway to **deny asylum to those who had passed through a safe third country** (e.g. Russia or Sweden)\u301030\u2020L183-L190\u3011, and to **detain** or swiftly deport those unlikely to get asylum\u301030\u2020L183-L191\u3011. Border checks were tightened, even on Norway\u2019s northern frontier with Russia where an unusual influx occurred (migrants bicycled across the arctic Storskog border). Public debate in Norway, as elsewhere, shifted \u201cfrom sympathy and compassion to concerns about the problems refugees might bring,\u201d as one analyst observed\u301030\u2020L177-L184\u3011. In the following years, Norway continued to receive a modest number of refugees through UN resettlement programs and family reunification, but it maintained strict controls on spontaneous asylum seekers. Norway also cut welfare benefits for asylum seekers and encouraged repatriation. It remained slightly more open than Denmark (Norway, for instance, did *not* pursue offshoring asylum and it participates in UN refugee resettlement quotas), but broadly it aligned with the Scandinavian trend of tougher asylum regimes post-2015.\n\n**Finland** also faced an unprecedented wave in 2015, with over **32,000 asylum seekers** (compared to only ~3,600 the year before)\u301032\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301033\u2020L266-L274\u3011. Many were young Iraqi men who traveled through Sweden to Finnish Lapland. The Finnish government, which included the nationalist Finns Party, reacted by quickly **tightening asylum criteria**. In late 2015, Finland suspended processing of asylum claims from Iraqis and Somalis, intending to reassess and raise the standard for granting protection\u301032\u2020L185-L193\u3011. It also reduced cash assistance to asylum seekers and instituted border screening at the northern crossing\u301032\u2020L185-L193\u3011. The outcome was a high rejection rate \u2013 by 2016, nearly **half of the 2015 asylum applicants** received negative decisions\u301031\u2020L9-L17\u3011. Finland\u2019s stance highlighted security concerns and a desire to avoid becoming a preferred destination. Although Finland did participate in the EU\u2019s refugee relocation on a limited basis, public opinion there also skewed against intake of non-Europeans. By the late 2010s, the annual number of asylum seekers in Finland fell back to a few thousand, and policies remained comparatively strict.\n\n**Iceland**, with its small population, experienced far fewer arrivals (usually in the hundreds per year) but did make notable gestures such as expanding its refugee resettlement slightly after public campaigns in 2015. Overall, the Scandinavian and Nordic region pivoted from an image of humanitarian super-acceptance (exemplified by Sweden pre-2016) to policies as restrictive as the European norm or tougher. This was driven both by the sheer scale of the 2015 shock to these societies and by the rise of anti-immigrant political forces that capitalized on integration challenges and public anxiety. By 2025, countries like Sweden and Denmark were actively trying to **reduce immigrant numbers**, marking a stark change from their earlier openness.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s immigration policy from 2010 to 2025 underwent profound changes, heavily influenced by domestic politics and the landmark decision to exit the EU (Brexit). Even prior to Brexit, the UK (which was an EU member until January 2020) had a **more restrictive asylum stance** than many continental peers. It opted out of EU refugee relocation schemes and maintained tight border control as a non-Schengen country. Throughout the 2010s, successive UK governments (Conservative-led) set an official goal to reduce net migration, though in practice total immigration remained high due to EU free movement and international labor/students. Regarding **asylum seekers and refugees**, the UK took in comparatively small numbers: e.g., at the height of the crisis in 2015\u201316, Britain received only **around 38,000 asylum applications in 2016**, versus Germany\u2019s 722,000 that year\u301023\u2020L248-L256\u3011. The UK did contribute to refugee relief through **resettlement programs** (such as taking some Syrian refugees directly from Middle East camps, albeit in the low thousands), but it generally *discouraged spontaneous asylum arrivals*. The government\u2019s **\u201chostile environment\u201d** policy, introduced in 2012, exemplified this approach: it aimed to make life difficult for undocumented migrants and asylum claimants by restricting access to jobs, housing, and services, thereby deterring new entrants\u301023\u2020L254-L262\u3011\u301023\u2020L263-L270\u3011. As a result, asylum seekers in the UK often faced long waits without the right to work, and some ended up destitute or in immigration detention. Notably, the UK is the only European country with no statutory time limit on detaining immigrants, a practice that saw thousands held in removal centers indefinitely\u301023\u2020L261-L269\u3011.\n\nA defining political development was **Brexit**, with the 2016 referendum campaign significantly fueled by concerns over immigration \u2013 though primarily focusing on intra-EU migration (free movement of EU workers) rather than refugees. Nonetheless, the general anti-immigration sentiment carried over to asylum issues. After leaving the EU, the UK ended free movement and introduced a new points-based immigration system in 2021 for all nationalities. This system favors skilled workers and imposes salary/education thresholds, effectively **shutting out most low-skilled foreign workers** (for whom only limited seasonal visas are available). It represented a shift to a more selective labor migration policy. On asylum, freed from EU Dublin rules, the UK government moved to implement some of the **harshest deterrence measures** among liberal democracies. In 2022, it announced the controversial **\u201cRwanda plan\u201d**: a policy to send certain asylum seekers (those arriving irregularly, e.g. by boat across the English Channel) on a one-way flight to Rwanda, where they would have to seek asylum instead\u301024\u2020L1-L9\u3011. The logic was to break the business model of people smugglers and discourage migrants from attempting dangerous Channel crossings. This offshoring plan, however, faced legal challenges and as of late 2023, the UK Supreme Court ruled it *unlawful* because Rwanda was not deemed a safe third country\u301024\u2020L1-L9\u3011. The government has responded by pushing new legislation (the 2023 Illegal Migration Act) that bars anyone arriving irregularly from ever settling in the UK and lays the groundwork for future offshoring deals\u301024\u2020L13-L21\u3011. The *rhetoric* around these policies has been very strict \u2013 ministers often speak of \u201cstopping the boats\u201d and taking back control of borders, in line with hardline public sentiment among portions of the electorate.\n\nFurthermore, the UK significantly reduced **refugee family reunion rights** and considered withdrawing from parts of the European human rights frameworks to enable tougher deportations\u301024\u2020L19-L27\u3011. All in all, the UK\u2019s post-Brexit approach is characterized by **tight controls on both asylum and low-skilled work migration**, while still welcoming select skilled workers and certain refugees through official resettlement. Public sentiment in the UK has been divided: there is support for helping genuine refugees (e.g. strong support for Ukrainians and Hong Kong arrivals in recent years), but also a persistent undercurrent of anti-immigrant feeling that shaped policy. The UK\u2019s departure from the EU allowed it to go its own way on immigration \u2013 a way that has proven to be one of the most restrictive among Western European nations for irregular migrants.\n\n## Public Sentiment, Media Narratives, and Political Discourse\n\nEuropean public opinion on immigration in the 2010\u20132025 period has been deeply divided and at times volatile. The large migrant arrivals, especially in 2015\u201316, became a flashpoint for politics and media across the continent, fueling the rise of populist movements and changing the tone of national debates. Several key aspects characterize the public sentiment and discourse:\n\n- **Polarization of Public Opinion:** In the early 2010s, attitudes toward refugees in many European countries were moderately positive or improving. Survey data from 2014 (just before the crisis) showed that in 17 countries surveyed, **less than half of respondents disagreed with the idea that their government should be generous to refugees**, with an average only around 25% holding anti-refugee views\u301021\u2020L692-L700\u3011. However, the events of 2015\u20132016 triggered a clear backlash. By 2016, anti-refugee sentiment had grown \u2013 though it was still a *minority* position in most countries, it increased significantly compared to 2014\u301021\u2020L695-L703\u3011\u301021\u2020L707-L715\u3011. Notably, countries at the forefront of the crisis saw some of the largest opinion shifts: for instance, **Germany** and **Austria**, which initially had welcoming attitudes, experienced a sharp swing towards skepticism by 2016\u301021\u2020L698-L706\u3011. Meanwhile, Eastern European societies had been more wary from the outset and remained broadly opposed to taking in refugees. Importantly, Europeans tended (and still tend) to **differentiate between types of immigrants**: surveys indicate that the public is *\u201cpositive about genuine refugees, skeptical about economic migrants, and strongly opposed to unauthorized immigration\u201d*\u301022\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Many people empathize with those fleeing war (especially women and children) but have negative views of migrants seen as coming for jobs or perceived to be violating rules. This distinction was evident in the *relative* acceptance of Ukrainian refugees in 2022, compared to the suspicion toward Middle Eastern arrivals in 2015. Overall, immigration became highly salient on voters\u2019 minds \u2013 Eurobarometer polling showed the share of Europeans citing immigration as a top national issue jumped from ~10% in 2012 to **30% by late 2015** (and an astonishing 75% in Germany at that peak)\u301021\u2020L711-L718\u3011. This heightened salience meant immigration could swing elections and referendums (as it arguably did with Brexit).\n\n- **Media Imagery and Narrative:** The European media played a powerful role in framing the immigration issue. Coverage oscillated between compassionate and alarmist. In summer 2015, sympathetic images (such as the tragic photo of toddler Alan Kurdi drowned on a Turkish beach) briefly rallied public compassion and calls to \u201chelp refugees.\u201d But much of the media narrative \u2013 especially in tabloids and some mainstream outlets \u2013 depicted the situation as a *\u201cmigrant crisis\u201d*, using metaphors like \u201c**flow**, **flood**, and **invasion**\u201d to describe the arrival of people\u301023\u2020L183-L190\u3011\u301023\u2020L216-L224\u3011. This language, repeated incessantly, had the effect of heightening fears. As one commentator noted, Europe tended to imagine itself the *\u201cvictim\u201d* of a migrant influx, an *other* that causes *\u201canxiety and fear in the European mind\u201d*\u301023\u2020L199-L207\u3011. Media and political rhetoric often conflated refugees with security threats or cultural threats, framing the issue as a *\u201cclash of civilizations\u201d* in certain populist narratives\u301023\u2020L216-L224\u3011. For example, sensational stories about crimes or sexual assaults involving migrants (such as the incidents in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve 2015) received huge coverage and were generalized to entire groups, amplifying public anxiety. On the other hand, there were also vigorous media voices countering these narratives, highlighting positive refugee stories and condemning xenophobia. Social media became a battleground of competing stories \u2013 some spreading misinformation about immigrants, others mobilizing support for them. The term *\u201crefugee crisis\u201d* itself has been critiqued as Eurocentric, implying the *people* were the crisis rather than the wars causing their flight\u301023\u2020L201-L209\u3011. Nevertheless, this term took hold in public discourse. Domestic media in Eastern Europe largely reinforced negative depictions (often without direct exposure to refugees on the ground), while media in countries like Germany and Sweden were initially more supportive, then grew more critical as problems emerged. In sum, media framing greatly influenced sentiment: when portrayed en masse as an uncontrollable \u201cflood,\u201d immigrants were feared; when humanized (e.g. profiles of families, children), they elicited empathy. The prevalence of hostile and fear-inducing imagery by mid-2010s contributed to a more negative public mood in many places.\n\n- **Rise of Populist and Anti-Immigrant Politics:** The immigration issue became a boon for right-wing populist and nationalist parties across Europe. From **Britain** to **Scandinavia** to **Central Europe**, parties that campaigned on stopping immigration saw surges in support. The *Brexit* referendum in 2016 was partly won on the slogan of \u201ctaking back control\u201d of borders, capitalizing on public unease with EU free movement and refugee numbers. In **Germany**, the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party pivoted from euro-skepticism to anti-immigration messaging and vaulted into the Bundestag for the first time in 2017 with 94 seats\u301021\u2020L721-L729\u3011. In **Italy**, Matteo Salvini\u2019s League and other populists rode anti-migrant sentiment to electoral success, and in **France**, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front (now National Rally) made consistent gains, nearly winning the presidency in 2017 and 2022 on anti-immigration, anti-Islam platforms. Similar trends occurred in **Austria** (the Freedom Party entered government in 2017), **the Netherlands** (Geert Wilders\u2019 PVV grew), **Sweden** (Sweden Democrats became a kingmaker by 2022), **Denmark** (the Danish People\u2019s Party influenced policy heavily), **Hungary and Poland** (governing parties entrenched power with anti-immigrant appeals), and others. Empirical studies confirm that *\u201ca migrant influx increases support for populist right-wing parties\u201d*: for example, regions with higher shares of non-European immigrants showed higher votes for nationalist parties in European Parliament elections\u301021\u2020L721-L730\u3011. The political discourse in many countries thus took a hard turn. Even centrist leaders felt pressure to adopt tougher rhetoric or policies to avoid losing votes to the far right. This phenomenon is sometimes called *policy convergence* \u2013 mainstream parties tightening immigration stances (as seen with the Social Democrats in Denmark, or the Conservatives in the UK) to neutralize the appeal of extremists. While this did not happen uniformly everywhere, it was a noticeable pattern. The **backlash** against Merkel\u2019s refugee policy, for example, was cited as a factor in the success of the AfD and also influenced other European leaders to *\u201cnot repeat Germany\u2019s mistake\u201d* as they saw it. It is important to note that not all political outcomes were negative for pro-immigrant forces \u2013 there were also pro-refugee rallies and the election of some leaders (e.g. Canada\u2019s Trudeau, Germany\u2019s Greens gaining) on more liberal platforms. But the general trend in Europe was that the migration crisis *\u201cdivided public opinion and caused a political backlash\u201d*\u301021\u2020L684-L692\u3011\u301021\u2020L686-L694\u3011, shifting the Overton window in favor of more restrictive discourse.\n\n- **Public Concerns and Social Tensions:** Among the general public, immigration became associated with a host of concerns: pressure on welfare systems, competition for jobs, cultural change, and security risks. The salience of terrorism fears also played in \u2013 several Islamist terrorist attacks in Europe during the 2015\u20132017 period (Paris, Brussels, Berlin, etc.) heightened anxiety, even though the perpetrators were mostly home-grown or long-term residents rather than recent refugees. Still, the presence of ISIS militants claiming to infiltrate migrant flows created a linkage in the public mind between refugees and terrorism. Additionally, incidents of crime or sexual harassment involving migrant youths were magnified in discourse (e.g. the Cologne incident was a turning point in German media coverage). Many Europeans, especially in more ethnically homogeneous countries, felt apprehension about the impact of predominantly Muslim newcomers on social cohesion and national identity. This was evident in how some media and politicians spoke of defending \u201cChristian Europe\u201d or \u201cour way of life.\u201d At the extreme, xenophobic and racist hate crimes rose in some areas, targeting refugee shelters or immigrants on the street. However, it must be emphasized that **there were also significant segments of society that mobilized in support of immigrants** \u2013 from volunteer networks welcoming refugees at train stations, to NGOs providing aid, to ordinary citizens joining movements like Germany\u2019s *\u201cWillkommenskultur\u201d* (culture of welcome) in 2015. European sentiment was not monolithic: it was and is a battle between **solidarity and fear**. Indeed, polling suggests a majority in many countries still support the principle of asylum for those fleeing persecution\u30101\u2020L19-L24\u3011, but they simultaneously worry about *illegal immigration*. By the 2020s, surveys showed a nuanced picture \u2013 fatigue with large numbers and integration challenges, but also recognition of immigrants\u2019 contributions. The discourse remains highly charged, with immigration continuing to be one of the top electoral issues in several countries (e.g. it featured prominently in the 2022 French election campaigns and in debates in Sweden, Italy, etc.).\n\nIn conclusion, the public debate on immigration in Europe from 2010 to 2025 has been intense and often contentious. Media narratives have significantly shaped perceptions, sometimes in misleading ways. Political entrepreneurs have used the issue to rally support, leading to shifts in policy. Yet, beneath the noise, European societies are gradually adjusting to new diversity: while nationalism has grown, there is also increased dialogue about integration and what it means to be a multicultural Europe. How the narrative evolves will likely depend on future migration events and the success (or failure) of integration efforts now underway.\n\n## Economic, Social, and Cultural Impacts: Challenges and Opportunities\n\nLarge-scale immigration has presented Europe with a complex mix of **challenges** to be managed and **opportunities** to be harnessed. The influx of asylum seekers and low-skilled workers has strained some systems in the short term, but immigrants have also contributed economically, filled crucial labor gaps, and enriched European societies. This section analyzes both sides of the coin.\n\n### Challenges and Obstacles\n\nDespite many newcomers successfully rebuilding their lives in Europe, immigration on the scale seen since 2010 has at times strained host countries\u2019 capacities and exposed shortcomings in integration processes:\n\n- **Pressure on Infrastructure and Services:** Sudden arrivals of tens of thousands of people created **bottlenecks in housing, healthcare, education, and welfare systems**. For example, during the 2015\u201316 surge, many German towns scrambled to convert gyms and army barracks into emergency shelters; schools had to set up special classes for refugee children; and healthcare providers dealt with linguistic and cultural barriers when treating new patients. Local authorities in Greece and Italy were overwhelmed managing transit camps and processing centers with minimal resources. Even years later, some areas (like the Greek islands or parts of Eastern Germany) continue to struggle with the concentration of asylum seekers. Large cities across Europe saw increased competition for affordable housing, contributing to shortages that affect both immigrants and native low-income residents. These immediate pressures required financial outlays \u2013 the **initial fiscal costs** of the 2015\u201316 influx were estimated at around 0.2% of EU GDP overall (and up to 1% of GDP in countries like Sweden or Germany that took many)\u301034\u2020L11-L19\u3011. **Local public services** such as schooling, childcare, and policing experienced **congestion effects** in areas with high migrant settlement\u301035\u2020L279-L287\u3011. While EU funds (e.g., the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund) helped somewhat, the resources often lagged behind needs. This strain has been one argument cited by communities resistant to accepting more migrants \u2013 a fear that public services will be overstretched.\n\n- **Integration Difficulties:** Integrating large numbers of refugees, many from very different cultural and educational backgrounds, posed a long-term challenge. **Language barriers** have been a fundamental hurdle \u2013 for instance, many Syrian or Afghan adults had to learn German or Swedish from scratch, delaying their entry into jobs. **Employment integration** has been slow for certain groups; across Europe, refugees initially faced high unemployment rates (partly due to restrictive asylum-work laws, and partly due to skill mismatches or language deficits). Over time, employment picks up \u2013 e.g., evidence shows that refugees start finding jobs after a few years \u2013 but initially this lag fuels a perception that they are a \u201cburden.\u201d In countries like Germany and Sweden, by the late 2010s only a minority of the 2015 cohort had stable jobs, with others still in training or entry-level work, though improvements were ongoing. **Education** is another area: schooling thousands of refugee children \u2013 some traumatized, some with gaps in formal education \u2013 required special support (like hiring cultural mediators and extra tutors). Many systems were unprepared at first. Additionally, **credential recognition** for professionals (doctors, engineers) has been cumbersome, meaning some highly educated immigrants end up under-employed (\u201cbrain waste\u201d). For low-skilled labor migrants, integration is often tied to precarious jobs and sometimes exploitation (e.g. reports of migrant farm workers in Italy underpaid by gangmasters). The sheer diversity of immigrant origins also means integration is not one-size-fits-all; each community (Somali, Iraqi, Eritrean, etc.) faces distinct issues.\n\n- **Social Tensions and Xenophobia:** The arrival of newcomers has, in some places, led to social frictions. Cultural differences \u2013 in religion, dress, gender norms \u2013 have sometimes sparked misunderstandings or conflict. For example, Scandinavian countries have debated issues like Islamic veils, halal slaughter, or gender-segregated swimming hours in the context of integrating Muslim immigrants. There have been instances of **discrimination and racism** directed at immigrants; far-right extremist attacks (like the 2016 murder of a politician in the UK who supported refugees, or arson attacks on migrant centers in Germany) underscore the worst-case backlash. In some urban areas, immigrant communities concentrate in poorer districts, leading to **segregation or \u201cghettoization\u201d**. Denmark explicitly identified \u201cparallel societies\u201d in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods and instituted policies to break them up, including harsh penalties for crimes in designated \u201cghettos\u201d\u301028\u2020L481-L490\u3011. Such policies themselves have been criticized as stigmatizing minorities. Moreover, the politics of anti-immigration have strained national cohesion \u2013 immigrants often feel unwelcome due to hostile rhetoric, hindering their sense of belonging. **Security concerns** also fall under challenges: though refugees are not generally criminals or terrorists, a few cases of involvement in crime or terror have magnified public fears. European authorities have had to enhance vetting and counter-radicalization efforts both to ensure safety and to reassure the public. The perception (and sometimes reality) of rising **crime** in areas with poor integration has been seized upon by anti-migrant voices, even if causation is complex.\n\n- **Administrative and Legal Burdens:** European asylum systems struggled under the load \u2013 backlogs of asylum cases skyrocketed, with many applicants waiting years for a decision, stuck in legal limbo. Countries had to hire more asylum adjudicators and expand court capacity for appeals. Some resorted to **fast-track procedures** or curtailed appeal rights to cope. The complexity of deporting those whose claims were rejected is another challenge: deportation requires travel documents and cooperation of origin countries, which is not always forthcoming. As a result, a significant number of rejected asylum seekers have **remained in Europe irregularly**, forming an *undocumented* population that is hard to estimate. This undermines the credibility of the system (as opponents point out) and can lead to shadow economies and exploitation of these individuals. The political will to enforce returns varied \u2013 some governments quietly tolerated those who stayed illegally because they are hard to remove, while others (like Austria or Denmark) took a hard line in detaining and removing people. The legal obligation of **non-refoulement** (not returning people to danger) also means many from countries like Syria or Afghanistan cannot be sent back even if not formally granted asylum, leaving them in protracted temporary statuses.\n\nIn summary, the challenges Europe faced include **short-term strains on resources, long-term integration hurdles, and social-political cleavages**. These are genuine issues that require investment and careful policy to address. However, they represent only one side of the ledger.\n\n### Contributions and Benefits\n\nBalanced against the difficulties are the significant contributions that immigrants \u2013 including refugees and low-skilled migrants \u2013 have made and continue to make to European economies and societies. Far from simply being a \u201cburden,\u201d these groups have provided various benefits:\n\n- **Labor Force and Economic Growth:** Immigrants have become essential to Europe\u2019s labor force, helping offset labor shortages in both high-skilled and low-skilled sectors. As native European populations age and shrink, **migrant workers fill crucial gaps** in industries like construction, agriculture, manufacturing, care services, and healthcare\u301040\u2020L201-L209\u3011\u301040\u2020L239-L247\u3011. For example, in agriculture, about **22% of workers are non-EU immigrants** in recent years\u301040\u2020L203-L211\u3011, and similar high proportions are found in domestic care and cleaning jobs in Western Europe \u2013 roles often labeled \u201cdirty, dangerous, and demeaning\u201d that locals are less willing to take. By taking up these jobs, immigrants support sectors that might otherwise face severe labor shortfalls. On the other end, skilled migrants (including some refugees) contribute in medicine, engineering, IT, research, and academia, boosting innovation. Cities like London and Berlin have benefited from immigrant tech entrepreneurs and professionals fueling the startup scene\u301040\u2020L225-L232\u3011\u301040\u2020L227-L231\u3011. An IMF analysis in 2024 found that **around two-thirds of new jobs created from 2019 to 2023 in the EU were filled by non-EU citizens**, illustrating how migrants have accommodated strong labor demand while native unemployment stayed at record lows\u301035\u2020L270-L278\u3011\u301035\u2020L272-L279\u3011. This labor infusion is raising Europe\u2019s productive potential: the net immigration into the eurozone in 2020\u201323 (about 2 million additional workers) is projected to **increase the euro area\u2019s potential GDP by ~0.5% by 2030**\u301035\u2020L275-L283\u3011. In fact, this contribution could account for nearly half of the region\u2019s annual potential growth, mitigating the economic drag of demographic aging\u301035\u2020L277-L284\u3011. **Fiscal impacts** of immigration tend to be modestly positive or neutral in the long run \u2013 while refugees require upfront integration costs, once employed they pay taxes and consume goods, contributing to the economy. The *McKinsey Global Institute* estimated that immigrants contribute approximately **\u20ac1 trillion to Europe\u2019s GDP every year**\u301040\u2020L251-L259\u3011. In countries like Germany, studies have suggested that the 2015 refugees, if properly integrated, could eventually help increase GDP growth and alleviate pension funding pressures by expanding the workforce. \n\n- **Addressing Demographic Challenges:** Virtually all European societies face aging populations and low birth rates. Immigrants, who are often younger and in family-rearing stages, help **rejuvenate demographics**. They not only fill jobs but also boost birth numbers. For instance, without immigration, several countries would have seen population decline; with immigration, countries like Germany actually sustained slight population growth in recent years. **Immigrants contribute to population balance** \u2013 Germany\u2019s population would be significantly older on average if not for the influx of younger migrants\u301040\u2020L211-L218\u3011. This has implications for sustaining pensions and healthcare systems for the elderly. While immigration alone cannot fully solve the aging problem, it certainly *delays and softens* its impact. Additionally, immigrants often help care for the elderly (many work in eldercare), thus directly addressing needs created by aging. In summary, young migrant workers are supporting Europe\u2019s older generations both through their labor and by paying into social security systems.\n\n- **Innovation and Entrepreneurship:** Immigration tends to spur **entrepreneurial activity** and innovation. Many immigrants start small businesses \u2013 from restaurants and retail shops to tech startups \u2013 thereby creating jobs. Diverse teams have been shown to foster creativity and new ideas. The presence of highly educated immigrants in research and development roles has positive spillovers for innovation as well. Some of Europe\u2019s prominent new companies were founded by immigrants or their children. Moreover, immigrants often maintain links to their home countries that can facilitate trade and investment (the diaspora effect). This dynamism is an often under-appreciated benefit \u2013 for example, immigrant-founded businesses have contributed significantly to London\u2019s economy and to revitalizing stagnating neighborhoods in cities across Europe.\n\n- **Cultural Enrichment and Revitalization:** The influx of people from different backgrounds has made European societies more culturally diverse, with new cuisines, music, art, and perspectives entering the social fabric. Immigrant communities have **revitalized depopulating areas** in some cases \u2013 a notable example is small towns in Italy and Spain that welcomed refugee families to counteract rural exodus, thereby keeping schools open and local businesses running. Cultural exchange works both ways: immigrants adapt to European lifestyles, but they also bring elements of their heritage that can enrich host cultures. Cities like **Amsterdam, Paris, and Barcelona** thrive as cosmopolitan melting pots, benefitting from \u201cthe rich tapestry of immigrant experiences\u201d\u301040\u2020L255-L263\u3011. Diversity can enhance creativity in industries like fashion, cuisine, and the arts. On a social level, immigrants and their children have become sports heroes, doctors, teachers, and neighbors \u2013 gradually shifting Europe\u2019s self-image to a more pluralistic one. While integration is not without friction, over time many immigrant families do successfully integrate, contributing to social cohesion through civic participation and even serving in public office. The cultural contributions \u2013 from Turkish restaurants in Berlin to Syrian doctors in British hospitals to Somali-British Olympic champion Mo Farah \u2013 underscore how immigrants have become an integral part of Europe\u2019s story.\n\n- **Filling Skill Gaps and Essential Services:** Beyond raw labor force numbers, immigrants often bring skills that are in short supply. Europe has faced shortages of medical personnel, IT specialists, engineers, and seasonal farm labor, among others. Migrants help **fill these skill gaps**. For example, **healthcare systems** in the UK, Germany, and Nordic countries rely heavily on foreign-born doctors, nurses, and caregivers (including refugees who retrained). During the COVID-19 pandemic, many immigrants worked on the frontlines as health workers, delivery drivers, and in food supply chains, leading some to re-evaluate them as \u201cessential workers\u201d rather than burdens. In the high-tech sector, skilled migration keeps Europe competitive: cities actively seek global tech talent to drive innovation hubs. Meanwhile, low-skilled migrants ensure that agriculture harvests are gathered and that construction projects can be completed despite native labor shortages. This **complementarity** means immigrants often take jobs that would either remain unfilled or would cause sectors to contract, which would hurt the wider economy. By enabling industries to maintain output and expand, immigration supports overall growth and employment for natives too. The European Central Bank has noted that foreign workers have significantly boosted real GDP by raising employment\u301034\u2020L1-L9\u3011.\n\n- **Long-Term Fiscal and Development Benefits:** In the long run, if integration policies are effective, immigrants tend to converge toward similar employment rates as natives, meaning they will largely finance their own public costs through taxes. Second-generation immigrants (children of immigrants born in Europe) generally have higher education levels and are poised to contribute even more. Additionally, migration has **global development benefits**: immigrants send remittances back home (over $600 billion annually worldwide\u301040\u2020L239-L247\u3011), which helps reduce poverty and can stabilize regions (potentially reducing future forced migration). This creates a positive feedback loop: well-integrated immigrants can aid their origin countries\u2019 development, which in the long term could lessen push factors.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that the positive impacts are not automatic \u2013 they depend on policy choices and social attitudes. To maximize benefits, European countries need to continue focusing on **effective integration**: language acquisition, education, access to the labor market, and anti-discrimination measures. The IMF urges efforts to quickly integrate migrants into the workforce and scale up public services in line with population increases\u301035\u2020L279-L287\u3011. The evidence so far suggests that when given the opportunity, many immigrants become self-sufficient and even job-creators. For example, **Ukrainian refugees** in 2022\u201323 have entered European labor markets faster than previous refugee waves, thanks in part to immediate work rights\u301035\u2020L273-L276\u3011, contributing to host economies rather than languishing idly. This underscores how policy (like granting work permission and recognition of qualifications) can turn a potentially costly situation into a mutually beneficial one.\n\nIn conclusion, immigrants have undeniably **brought challenges** to Europe \u2013 integration is a work in progress, and mismanaged influxes can strain societies. Yet they have also **brought vital contributions**: shoring up the labor force, energizing economies, caring for Europe\u2019s aging populace, and adding to the cultural richness. The net effect of immigration depends on one\u2019s timeframe: in the short run, costs and disruptions may loom large; in the long run, however, immigrants are helping to **sustain Europe\u2019s growth and diversity**. As one report put it, *\u201cimmigration is not merely a necessity but a powerful opportunity for growth, innovation, and cultural advancement\u201d*\u301040\u2020L287-L293\u3011. The task for European policymakers is to address the challenges (e.g., through smart integration investments) so that the opportunities can fully materialize, securing a more vibrant and dynamic future for the continent.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrom 2010 to the present, Europe\u2019s encounter with increased immigration \u2013 especially the dramatic wave of asylum seekers and refugees \u2013 has been a defining development. It has tested the continent\u2019s values and institutions, triggering a range of responses. We have seen **Western European democracies oscillate between humanitarian openness and restrictive measures**, **Eastern European states fortify against immigration**, **Scandinavian ideals give way to pragmatism**, and a post-Brexit UK forging an insular path. Immigration has undoubtedly changed Europe: demographically, it has made societies more diverse; politically, it has reshaped party systems and discourse; economically, it has added both strain and strength. \n\nThe report\u2019s comparative analysis shows that **policy responses diverged** \u2013 from Germany\u2019s and Sweden\u2019s early leadership in welcoming refugees\u30106\u2020L205-L209\u3011 to Hungary\u2019s border fence and Denmark\u2019s zero-asylum ambition\u301028\u2020L451-L459\u3011 \u2013 reflecting each nation\u2019s history, capacity, and politics. At the EU level, attempts at solidarity fell short of truly unified action, leaving an unfinished agenda for reform. Public sentiment remains split, but there is evidence that with time, initial fears can ease as immigrants integrate and contribute.\n\nOverall, marginalized immigrant groups such as asylum seekers and low-skilled workers have proven to be *resilient contributors* when given the chance. Many have learned new languages, found jobs, and started businesses; their children attend schools and are becoming part of the new generation of Europeans. The **economic contributions** \u2013 from labor force growth to entrepreneurship \u2013 and **social contributions** \u2013 from cultural enrichment to caring roles \u2013 highlight that immigrants are not only beneficiaries of refuge but also benefactors to their new homes\u301040\u2020L251-L259\u3011\u301035\u2020L270-L278\u3011. Europe\u2019s challenge moving forward is to address legitimate concerns (security, integration, social cohesion) without closing itself off to the benefits of migration in an interdependent world.\n\nIn summary, the period from 2010 to 2025 has been one of adaptation. Europe has learned hard lessons from the 2015 crisis and shown both flaws and strengths in its response. The presence of asylum seekers and other migrants has spurred difficult but necessary conversations about identity, responsibility, and the kind of societies Europeans want to build. While the journey has not been easy, the narrative is far from solely negative. If Europe can continue to improve its policies \u2013 sharing responsibility, investing in integration, and combating extremist narratives \u2013 then immigration can be managed in a way that upholds European values and yields shared prosperity. In a continent facing aging and skill gaps, immigrants are likely to remain *part of the solution*. The past fifteen years have set the stage; the coming years will reveal whether Europe fully capitalizes on the human potential that has arrived at its doors, turning a period of challenge into an opportunity for renewal.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Eurostat, *Asylum Applications and Decisions*, various years\u30105\u2020L100-L107\u3011\u301036\u2020L159-L167\u3011.  \n- Genus (SpringerOpen) \u2013 Greco et al., \u201cEurope and the recent influx of asylum seekers: EU Member States\u2019 capability to grant protection\u201d\u30105\u2020L100-L107\u3011\u30106\u2020L201-L209\u3011.  \n- Pew Research Center \u2013 \u201cNumber of Refugees to Europe Surges to Record 1.3 Million in 2015\u201d\u301036\u2020L141-L149\u3011\u301036\u2020L167-L175\u3011.  \n- IZA World of Labor \u2013 Hatton, \u201cEuropean asylum policy before and after the crisis\u201d\u301021\u2020L711-L719\u3011\u301021\u2020L721-L729\u3011.  \n- The Guardian \u2013 Pai, \u201cThe refugee \u2018crisis\u2019 showed Europe\u2019s worst side to the world\u201d\u301023\u2020L183-L192\u3011\u301023\u2020L224-L232\u3011.  \n- The Local (Sweden) \u2013 \u201cSweden\u2019s asylum U-turn and record low approvals\u201d\u301026\u2020L191-L199\u3011\u301026\u2020L209-L217\u3011.  \n- Chatham House \u2013 Pace, \u201cDenmark\u2019s immigrants forced out by government policies\u201d\u301028\u2020L421-L430\u3011\u301028\u2020L443-L450\u3011.  \n- Reuters \u2013 \u201cNorway tightens asylum rules as anti-migrant sentiment strengthens\u201d\u301030\u2020L177-L184\u3011\u301030\u2020L183-L191\u3011; \u201cFinland raises 2015 forecast for asylum seekers to 50,000\u201d\u301032\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301032\u2020L185-L193\u3011.  \n- Finnish Ministry of Interior \u2013 \u201cRefugees and asylum seekers\u201d (statistics)\u301033\u2020L266-L274\u3011.  \n- European Council \u2013 \u201cRefugees from Ukraine in the EU (Nov 2023)\u201d\u30108\u2020L151-L159\u3011.  \n- WIIW Study \u2013 \u201cNew migration challenges for the EU in the 2020s\u201d\u301018\u2020L225-L233\u3011\u301018\u2020L251-L259\u3011.  \n- Jacques Delors Centre \u2013 Lucas Rasche, \u201cWhy the EU needs a re-think on labour migration\u201d\u301012\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u301012\u2020L173-L179\u3011.  \n- IMF Working Paper 2024/211 \u2013 \u201cMigration into the EU: Macroeconomic Implications\u201d\u301035\u2020L270-L278\u3011\u301035\u2020L279-L287\u3011.  \n- Modern Diplomacy \u2013 Awan, \u201cThe Vital Role of Immigrants in Europe\u2019s Development\u201d\u301040\u2020L203-L211\u3011\u301040\u2020L251-L259\u3011.  \n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":492,"end_ix":505,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Europe and the recent influx of asylum seekers: the EU Member States capability to grant international protection | Genus | Full Text","url":"https://genus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41118-025-00250-7#:~:text=the%20flow%20of%20asylum%20seekers,widely%20across%20EU%20Member%20States","text":"the flow of asylum seekers to Europe, particularly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, began to steadily increase and peaked in 2015/2016, reaching over 2.5 million.

Macro-demographic arithmetic: preventing a workforce crunch\n\n| Indicator | EU-27, 2024 | Projected 2050* |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------|\n| Old-age dependency ratio (65+ / 20\u201364) | **33.9 %** | **\u2248 60 %** |\n\n\\*mid-range projection, 2024 Ageing Report.\n\n- **Pension solvency & health-care costs** \u2013  The Ageing Report shows Europe will have only ~1.7 workers for every retiree by 2050 (down from 3 today), driving up old-age expenditure by 2-4 pp of GDP in many states.  Simply raising retirement ages cannot fully offset this gap, so each additional working-age migrant directly alleviates the fiscal squeeze. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n- **Political salience:** finance ministries and central banks now openly link net migration to debt sustainability scenarios; at recent ECOFIN workshops officials quietly warn that without **net immigration the working-age EU population would shrink a further 20 % by 2050.** \ue200cite\ue202turn0news50\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 2.  Labour-market pressure from business & public services\n\n### 2.1  Filling pervasive shortages\n- The Commission\u2019s 2023 ESDE report lists **persistent shortages \u201cacross all skill levels,\u201d** with construction, ICT, engineering, health care and hospitality most acute.  Non-EU workers are **8.7 pp more likely** than natives to be in shortage occupations.  Brussels therefore urges \u201ctargeted labour migration from non-EU countries\u201d as a headline remedy. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n- IMF analysis finds that **\u2248 \u2154 of all net jobs created in the EU between 2019-23 were filled by non-EU citizens**, while native unemployment stayed at historic lows.  Removing that cushion would have stalled the post-pandemic recovery. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n\n### 2.2  Strategic sectors lobby hard\n| Sector | Illustrative metric | Policy response |\n|--------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **Health-care (UK)** | Minority-ethnic staff now comprise **49.9 % of NHS hospital doctors** | Home Office keeps the health-worker visa fast-track despite cutting other low-skilled routes. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201 |\n| **Agri-food (Italy, Spain)** | Migrants \u2248 22 % of EU agricultural labour | Seasonal-worker quotas renewed annually; amnesties for undocumented farm hands. |\n| **Green & digital** | EU estimates 1.7-4.1 bn \u20ac of *extra* retraining just for net-zero tech by 2030 | Commission drafts \u201cTalent Partnerships\u201d with North-Africa/Western Balkans to import STEM skills. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201 |\n\nBusiness federations, hospital trusts and farmers\u2019 unions routinely warn ministers that tighter caps would **cut output or raise prices**; this behind-the-scenes lobbying often trumps headline anti-migration rhetoric.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Growth & public-finance calculations\n\n- The IMF estimates that the **net migration of roughly 2 million extra workers in 2020-23 will lift euro-area potential GDP by ~0.5 pp by 2030\u2014almost half of expected growth.**  Finance ministries therefore see controlled inflows as a macro-stabiliser. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n\n- In the UK, Treasury modelling values international students alone at **\u00a341.9 bn net in 2021/22** (\u2248 \u00a358 m per parliamentary constituency).  University vice-chancellors stress that overseas tuition fees cross-subsidise research\u2014which underpins the national innovation agenda\u2014creating a strong \u201cpro-visa\u201d lobby inside Whitehall. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4.  Electoral and coalition incentives\n\n| Country | Mainstream calculus that favours *some* openness |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| **Germany** | CDU/CSU & SPD both need Mittelstand votes; employers in Bavaria & Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg threaten relocation if skilled-worker visas slow. |\n| **Sweden** | Governing coalition struck a deal: tougher asylum rules *in exchange for* a new \u201ctalent visa\u201d to keep tech hubs competitive. |\n| **UK** | Post-Brexit points system bans most low-skilled entry, but the shortage-occupation list stays long; governments temper anti-migrant rhetoric to avoid scaring financial-services, universities and care-home sectors in key marginal constituencies. |\n\nCentrists tilt toward legal economic migration to **preserve urban professional support** and to deny far-right parties exclusive ownership of the \u201ceconomy\u201d plank.  The calculation: *be visibly tough on boats, quietly generous on visas that industry demands.*\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Normative, legal and foreign-policy pay-offs\n\n1. **Treaty & ECHR obligations** \u2013 avoiding infringement proceedings (or Strasbourg losses) requires minimum asylum standards; abandoning them would invite legal chaos and diplomatic cost.  \n2. **Soft-power & geopolitical leverage** \u2013 offering sanctuary (e.g., to Ukrainians) sharpens Europe\u2019s moral contrast with Russia; issuing work visas in exchange for energy or readmission deals buys leverage with origin states.  \n3. **EU solidarity bargains** \u2013 accepting quotas (even small ones) buys goodwill in Council negotiations on other dossiers (budget rebates, CAP funds, etc.).  Portugal, Ireland and Spain have traded modest refugee intakes for flexibility on fiscal or agricultural files.  \n\n---\n\n## 6.  Managing irregular flows through *legal* channels\n\nPolicy strategists increasingly view **expanded legal pathways as a border-management tool**:\n\n- **Labour corridors with Tunisia or Georgia** lower the incentive to pay smugglers, easing Frontex pressure.  \n- UK ministers justify the India Mobility Accord (graduate visas) as a quid-pro-quo for faster enforcement returns agreements.  \n\nCreating *doors* allows governments to **slam the \u201cwindows\u201d (irregular routes)** without crippling sectors that still need workers.\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Summary of the incentive mix\n\n| Incentive type | Who lobbies / benefits? | Political signal sent |\n|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Demographic & fiscal** | Finance ministries, pension funds | \u201cImmigration underwrites welfare\u2010state solvency.\u201d |\n| **Economic & sectoral** | Employers\u2019 federations, NHS/health trusts, universities | \u201cJobs and competitiveness depend on inflows.\u201d |\n| **Growth & macro stability** | Central banks, Treasuries, EU Commission | \u201cNet migration props up GDP and debt ratios.\u201d |\n| **Coalition & electoral** | Centrist parties, urban voters, diaspora | \u201cBalanced stance keeps extremists from power.\u201d |\n| **Legal & soft-power** | Foreign ministries, human-rights courts | \u201cEurope\u2019s brand = rule-of-law, humanitarian leadership.\u201d |\n| **Border management** | Interior ministries | \u201cLegal visas reduce irregular crossings.\u201d |\n\n**Bottom line:**  even where the politics of immigration are toxic, *quiet structural incentives*\u2014aging demographics, labour shortages, fiscal math, and sector-specific lobbying\u2014keep nudging European and UK policy-makers toward maintaining or re-opening channels for both low-skilled and high-skilled migrants.

This claim was supported by a misinterpreted headline from GB News, citing a forecast by Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In reality, net migration, which was 745,000 in 2022 and reduced to 672,000 by June 2023, is forecasted by the OBR to decline, not rise. The OBR's forecast indicates a decline to 336,000 by 2024-25, eventually reaching 315,000 by 2028-29. This represents a significant reduction from past figures, contrary to the social media misrepresentation. The posts attracted varied public opinion, including critiques of the government's migration policies. Professor Nando Sigona from the University of Birmingham labeled these posts as misleading and clarified that they falsely suggest an impending rise in net migration contrary to the OBR's predictions.

2020 two macro-crises have turbo-charged immigration rhetoric in Europe and the UK:\n\n1. **The COVID-19 pandemic** (2020-22)  \n2. **The Israel-Hamas war that erupted after 7 October 2023**  \n\nBoth triggered fresh waves of misinformation that built on pre-existing \u201cgreat-replacement\u201d and security tropes.  Below, each crisis is unpacked in three steps: (a) the dominant claims in public debate; (b) what the best evidence actually shows; and (c) why many of the viral narratives qualify as propaganda rather than fact.\n\n---\n\n## 1\u2003Pandemic-era rhetoric (2020-2022)\n\n| Typical claim | Reality check | Why it spread |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **\u201cMigrant camps are viral hot-spots endangering Europe.\u201d** | Camps were indeed vulnerable, but genomic tracing shows community transmission inside Europe, not border arrivals, drove the big winter 2020/21 surge. EU officials actually urged Greece to *evacuate* camps to protect residents\u3010turn10search0\u3011. | Visuals of overcrowded tents dovetailed with pre-existing \u2018invasion\u2019 imagery; easy scapegoat for policy failures. |\n| **\u201cNew variants arrive *with* migrants.\u201d** | Fact-checks found no link between African boat arrivals and the Alpha/Delta waves; the variants were seeded by returning holiday-makers and business travel\ufeff\u3010turn4search2\u3011. | Highly shareable single-cause explanation; feeds border-control agenda. |\n| **\u201cUndocumented workers keep dodging lockdown rules.\u201d** | Migrants were *over-represented among \u2018key workers\u2019*\u2014health-care aides, farm pickers, delivery drivers\u2014who *had* to stay mobile, often without PPE\ufeff\u3010turn5search8\u3011. | Frame shifts blame from working conditions to the workers themselves. |\n\n### What separates fact from propaganda?\n\n* **Data provenance.** Reputable sources (Eurostat infection maps, WHO epidemiology) rarely appear in the viral posts; memes usually cite anonymous \u201cdoctors\u201d or recycled headlines.  \n* **Numerical context.** In 2021 non-EU nationals made up **\u2248 5 %** of the EU population, yet the most\u2010shared Facebook posts claimed they caused \u201cmost\u201d infections\u2014an arithmetical impossibility.  \n* **Motive tests.** Who benefits?  Lockdown-shy politicians and far-right parties gained by redirecting anger toward outsiders instead of domestic failings.\n\n---\n\n## 2\u2003Post-7 October 2023 rhetoric\n\n### 2.1  New talking-points\n\n| Claim | Factual status |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **\u201cHamas fighters are infiltrating Europe disguised as refugees.\u201d** | No credible security briefings substantiate this.  Europol\u2019s 2024 threat assessment lists *zero* verified Hamas infiltrations via asylum routes. Viral \u2018paraglider\u2019 and \u2018crisis-actor\u2019 videos were geolocated to Egypt or old footage\ufeff\u3010turn3search0\u3011\u3010turn3search4\u3011. |\n| **\u201cPro-Palestine marches prove Europe has let in an extremist fifth column.\u201d** | Millions protested peacefully; arrests for hate crimes were *tiny* fractions of turnout. German police recorded 1 506 politically motivated anti-Israel offences in 2024; 80 % were social-media speech, not violence, and involved both migrants and natives\ufeff\u3010turn0search5\u3011. |\n| **\u201cIslamophobia is exaggerated\u2014criticism of Hamas isn\u2019t racism.\u201d** | Aggregate hate-crime data show a *spike* in anti-Muslim incidents after 7 October; EU anti-racism coordinator Marion Lalisse warned Islamophobia now rivals antisemitism in prevalence\ufeff\u3010turn1search9\u3011\u3010turn1search3\u3011. |\n\n### 2.2  Propaganda mechanics\n\n| Technique | Example | Diagnostic tell-tale |\n|-----------|---------|----------------------|\n| **Recycled footage with new captions** | Cairo sports-parachute clip recast as Hamas attack\ufeff\u3010turn3search0\u3011 | Reverse-image search shows earlier upload dates. |\n| **Out-of-context statistics** | Posts claiming \u201c315 000 extra migrants next year\u201d in Britain misrepresented Office for Budget Responsibility projections; true forecast shows *declining* net migration\ufeff\u3010turn10news10\u3011 | Number quoted without denominator/time-frame. |\n| **False binaries** (\u201csupport Israel *or* open borders\u201d) | Columns insisting any criticism of Israeli military tactics is simultaneous endorsement of mass migration\ufeff\u3010turn1search0\u3011 | Oversimplifies multi-issue debates into one tribal choice. |\n\n---\n\n## 3\u2003Why propaganda resonates\n\n1. **Crisis layering.** Pandemic fear primed audiences to see outsiders as bio-threats; Gaza-related images of violence then mapped neatly onto security fears.  \n2. **Algorithmic amplification.** Fact-checkers recorded *tens of millions* of views on Gaza-mislabelled clips within 72 hours\ufeff\u3010turn3news10\u3011.  Emotionally charged, short-form videos outperform sober policy data.  \n3. **Political pay-offs.** Far-right parties converted viral narratives into electoral gains (e.g., AfD in Germany, Sweden Democrats)\ufeff\u3010turn1search2\u3011.  Mainstream politicians sometimes echo simplified tropes to avoid being \u201cout-flanked\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 4\u2003Separating wheat from chaff \u2014 a quick guide\n\n| Test | What to do | Red flags |\n|------|------------|-----------|\n| **Source audit** | Check whether the claim comes from AP/Reuters fact-checks, court filings, or official statistics. | \u201cAnonymous border guard\u201d anecdotes; screenshots with no link. |\n| **Date & place** | Use reverse-image tools or basic geo-location (background signs, weather). | Footage with mismatched scenery (e.g., palm trees in a \u201cBerlin\u201d riot). |\n| **Proportionality** | Compare numbers against baseline (per-capita crime, share of population). | Claims that 5 % of residents commit \u201cmost\u201d offences. |\n| **Language cues** | Note emotive words: \u201chordes,\u201d \u201cswarm,\u201d \u201cinvasion,\u201d \u201creplacement.\u201d | Such framing almost always indicates ideological spin. |\n| **Cross-field consistency** | Does the same speaker accept Ukrainians but reject Syrians?  That asymmetry hints at ethnic or religious bias rather than safety logic. |\n\n---\n\n## 5\u2003Bottom line\n\n* **Factual landscape:** Europe still records zero confirmed Hamas infiltrations via asylum routes; migrants did **not** drive COVID infection waves; and official crime or welfare data do not support the \u201cburden\u201d hyperbole.  \n* **Propaganda landscape:** Viral clips, de-contextualised numbers and loaded language dominate social feeds, shaping public perception faster than fact-checks can debunk them.  \n* **Discerning truth:** Rely on primary statistics, established fact-checking outlets, and contextual ratios.  Beware single anecdote \u2192 sweeping conclusion leaps.  Ask \u201cwho benefits?\u201d whenever an emotionally charged claim surfaces.\n\n---\n\n### Further reading\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Key recent coverage\ue202turn0news28,turn3news10,turn10news10\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\u3010turn10search0\u3011","start_idx":973,"end_idx":988,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/article/world/eu-asks-greece-to-move-migrants-most-at-risk-from-coronavirus-out-of-crowded-cam-idUSKBN21B2YC/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"alt":"([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/eu-asks-greece-to-move-migrants-most-at-risk-from-coronavirus-out-of-crowded-cam-idUSKBN21B2YC/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"webpage","title":"EU asks Greece to move migrants most at risk from coronavirus out ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/eu-asks-greece-to-move-migrants-most-at-risk-from-coronavirus-out-of-crowded-cam-idUSKBN21B2YC/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"reuters.com","attributions":null,"icon_type":null},{"matched_text":"\u3010turn4search2\u3011","start_idx":1311,"end_idx":1325,"safe_urls":["https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-migrants-not-responsible-for-latest-covid-19-surge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"alt":"([factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-migrants-not-responsible-for-latest-covid-19-surge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"webpage","title":"Migrants Not Responsible for Latest COVID-19 Surge - FactCheck.org","url":"https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-migrants-not-responsible-for-latest-covid-19-surge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"factcheck.org","attributions":null,"icon_type":null},{"matched_text":"\u3010turn5search8\u3011","start_idx":1610,"end_idx":1624,"safe_urls":["https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-025-09674-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8}],"alt":"([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-025-09674-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"webpage","title":"Immigrant key workers: their contribution to Europe's Covid-19 ...","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-025-09674-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"link.springer.com","attributions":null,"icon_type":null},{"matched_text":"\u3010turn3search0\u3011","start_idx":2705,"end_idx":2719,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-misinformation-fact-check-e58f9ab8696309305c3ea2bfb269258e?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"alt":"([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-misinformation-fact-check-e58f9ab8696309305c3ea2bfb269258e?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"webpage","title":"Israel-Hamas war: Misinformation is spreading.

This claim was supported by a misinterpreted headline from GB News, citing a forecast by Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In reality, net migration, which was 745,000 in 2022 and reduced to 672,000 by June 2023, is forecasted by the OBR to decline, not rise. The OBR's forecast indicates a decline to 336,000 by 2024-25, eventually reaching 315,000 by 2028-29. This represents a significant reduction from past figures, contrary to the social media misrepresentation. The posts attracted varied public opinion, including critiques of the government's migration policies. Professor Nando Sigona from the University of Birmingham labeled these posts as misleading and clarified that they falsely suggest an impending rise in net migration contrary to the OBR's predictions. The Reuters Fact Check team confirmed these findings, emphasizing that the claims about increasing net migration are incorrect.","attribution":"reuters.com","attributions":null,"icon_type":null,"thumbnail_url":null},{"matched_text":"\u3010turn1search0\u3011","start_idx":4099,"end_idx":4113,"safe_urls":["https://thegeopolitics.com/the-rising-far-right-of-europe/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"alt":"([thegeopolitics.com](https://thegeopolitics.com/the-rising-far-right-of-europe/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"webpage","title":"The Rising Far Right of Europe - The Geopolitics","url":"https://thegeopolitics.com/the-rising-far-right-of-europe/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"thegeopolitics.com","attributions":null,"icon_type":null},{"matched_text":"\u3010turn3news10\u3011","start_idx":4503,"end_idx":4516,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/e58f9ab8696309305c3ea2bfb269258e?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"alt":"([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e58f9ab8696309305c3ea2bfb269258e?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"webpage_extended","title":"FACT FOCUS: Misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war is flooding social media.

Among the misinformation includes false claims such as a top Israeli commander being kidnapped, a fabricated video mimicking a BBC News report, and old clips mislabeled as new events. Various specifics are debunked: the hospitalization of a Palestinian in August misportrayed as conflict stagecraft, an old U.S. Army arrival video in Romania circulated as Marines landing in Israel, and false captions on older videos mistakenly attributed to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Moreover, there were erroneous claims about Iranian and Qatari leaders making declarations linked to the conflict, none of which were accurate. Additionally, no credible sources have confirmed Ukraine supplying weapons to Hamas, contrary to another false claim. The spread of such disinformation has created confusion around the actual events unfolding in the Israel-Hamas war.","attribution":"apnews.com","attributions":null,"icon_type":null,"thumbnail_url":null},{"matched_text":"\u3010turn1search2\u3011","start_idx":4724,"end_idx":4738,"safe_urls":["https://www.democracynow.org/2024/6/11/mehreen_khan_eu_far_right_surge?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"alt":"([democracynow.org](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/6/11/mehreen_khan_eu_far_right_surge?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"webpage","title":"\u201cClear Shift\u201d Toward the Far Right: Anti-Immigrant Nationalists Gain ...","url":"https://www.democracynow.org/2024/6/11/mehreen_khan_eu_far_right_surge?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"democracynow.org","attributions":null,"icon_type":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200navlist\ue202Key recent coverage\ue202turn0news28,turn3news10,turn10news10\ue201","start_idx":6467,"end_idx":6533,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/e58f9ab8696309305c3ea2bfb269258e?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/misleading-claim-britains-net-migration-is-set-rise-by-315000-2024-03-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/06/israel-gaza-aid-macron-merz-europe/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10},{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"alt":"- [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/06/israel-gaza-aid-macron-merz-europe/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e58f9ab8696309305c3ea2bfb269258e?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/misleading-claim-britains-net-migration-is-set-rise-by-315000-2024-03-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)","prompt_text":"\nnavlist containing the following URLs:\n- [Amid Gaza outrage, Europe reaches a turning point on Israel](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/06/israel-gaza-aid-macron-merz-europe/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [FACT FOCUS: Misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war is flooding social media.
