Cell \r\nphones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\nmain source of this energy. The closer \r\nthe antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\ngreater the exposure to radiation. \r\nWith the increased use of cell phones, \r\nthere has been a growing concern \r\nover the potential health risks. Several \r\nstudies have explored the possibility \r\nof such risks:\r\nStudy 1 A German study (Stang \r\net\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\nwith a rare form of eye cancer called \r\nuveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n patients who did not have this eye \r\ncancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\nwas measured using a questionnaire. \r\nOn average, the eye cancer patients \r\nused cell phones more often.\r\nStudy 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\net al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\nwith brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\nwithout brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\ncell phone use was measured using a \r\nquestionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\ntwo groups was similar.\r\nStudy 3 A study published in The \r\nJournal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\nthat cell phone use speeds up activity \r\nin the brain. As part of a randomized \r\ncrossover study, 47 participants were \r\nfitted with a cell phone device on each \r\near and then underwent two positron \r\nemission topography, or PET, scans \r\nto measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\nDuring one scan, the cell phones were \r\nboth turned off. During the other \r\nscan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\ncall was made to the phone on the \r\nright ear. The order of when the call \r\nwas received (for the first or second \r\nscan) was randomized. Comparison \r\nof the PET scans showed a significant \r\nincrease in activity in the part of the \r\nbrain closest to the antenna during \r\nthe transmission of the automated \r\ncall.\r\nStudies 1 and 3 found potential \r\nphysiological responses to cell \r\nphone use. Study 2 did not.\r\nQuestion to Explore\r\nj Why do results of different medi\ufffecal studies sometimes disagree?\r\nj Consider the different study \r\ndesigns to explore whether cell \r\nphone use is associated with \r\nvarious types of physiological \r\nactivities in our bodies.

We \r\ndescribed shape, center, and variability, looked for patterns and unusual observa\ufffetions, and explored associations between variables. For these and other statistical \r\nanalyses to be useful, we must have \u201cgood data.\u201d But what\u2019s the best way to \r\ngather data to ensure they are \u201cgood\u201d? The studies described in Example 1 used \r\ntwo methods. The first two studies merely observed subjects, whereas the third \r\nstudy conducted an experiment with them. We\u2019ll now learn about such methods, \r\nstudy their pros and cons, and see both good and bad ways to use them. This will \r\nhelp us understand when we can trust the conclusions of a study and when we \r\nneed to be skeptical.\r\n2. Is the study ethically feasible?\r\n3. How can you design the study \r\nto be efficient?\r\n4. What types of biases or lurking \r\nvariables might exist?\r\nThinking Ahead\r\nA knowledge of different study de\ufffesigns for gathering data helps us un\ufffederstand how contradictory results \r\ncan happen in scientific research \r\nstudies and determine which studies \r\ndeserve our trust. In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\nlearn that the study design can have \r\na major impact on its results. Unless \r\nthe study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\nThroughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\nto the cell phone studies introduced in \r\nExample 1 to ask more questions and \r\nunderstand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\nto infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\nWe use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\nExample 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\nor eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\nindividuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\nsamples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\ninterest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\nis whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\namount of cell phone use.\r\nTypes of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\nSome studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\nassigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\nwe want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\ncalled treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n5HFDOO\r\nFrom Section 1.2, the population consists \r\nof all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\ndata on a subset of the population, which \r\nwe call the sample.\r\nFrom the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\nresponse variable measures the outcome \r\nof interest. Studies investigate how that \r\noutcome depends on the explanatory \r\nvariable. b\r\nExperimental Study\r\nA researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\nsubjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\nvariable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\nthe explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\nFor example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\nstudy, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>","Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\nof the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\nthe experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\nresponse variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\nit increased.\r\nAn experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\nin the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\nBy contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\nand the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\nthem. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\nObservational Study\r\nIn an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\nexplanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\nIn short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\nthe study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\ntreatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\nIdentifying experimental \r\nversus observational \r\nstudies\r\nb\r\nCell Phone Use\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nExample 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\nbetween cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body. We\u2019ve \r\nseen that Study 3 was an experiment. Studies 1 and 2 both examined the \r\namount of cell phone use for cancer patients and for noncancer patients us\ufffeing a questionnaire.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. Were Studies 1 and 2 experimental or observational studies?\r\nb. How were Studies 1 and 2 fundamentally different from Study 3 in \r\nterms of how the treatments were determined for each subject?\r\nThink It Through\r\na. In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\ngathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\ndetermined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\nobserved this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\nand 2 were observational studies.\r\nb. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\nthe subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\nto both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\nduring the second scan. The researchers imposed the treatments on \r\nthe subjects. So, Study 3 was an experimental study.*\r\nExample 2 \r\n*The researchers noted that \u201cResults of this study provide evidence that acute cell phone expo\ufffesure affects brain metabolic activity.

From its description, we\u2019ll try to determine \r\nwhether it is an experiment or an observational study.\r\nInsight\r\nOne reason that results of different medical studies sometimes disagree is \r\nthat they are not the same type of study. Experimental studies allow direct \r\ncausal inference to be made, whereas observational studies do not allow \r\ncausal inference.

It reported results from a \r\nstudy of 76,000 students in 497 high schools and 225 middle schools nation\ufffewide.1\r\n Each student in the study filled out a questionnaire. One question asked \r\nwhether the student used drugs. The study found that drug use was similar \r\nin schools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. For \r\ninstance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\ntwelfth graders from the two types of schools. In addition, the figure in the \r\nmargin shows the conditional proportions of drug use for these students.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. What were the response and explanatory variables?\r\nb.

This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\nassociation.\r\nAdvantage of Experiments Over \r\nObservational\u00a0Studies\r\nIn an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\nExample 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\nthere could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\ncancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\nwho do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\na possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\nphones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\nscreens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\neye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\nBy contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\nthe results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\nwhich subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\ngroups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\nsimilar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\nto have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\ncondition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\nthe subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\nthe amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\nwhich subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\nsubjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\nbe much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\nand the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\nwhether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\nnot affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\nOne treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\ndifferences, on the average.\r\nIn Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\nsubject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\norder in which the subject received the treatment.\r\nEstablishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\nestablish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\nassociation. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\neye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\nstudy, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\nimply causation.\r\nBecause it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\nexperiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\nwith an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\nwhich treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\nexplanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\ndiscovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\nconduct an experiment.\r\n5HFDOO\r\nFrom Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\na variable not observed in the study that \r\ninfluences the association between the \r\nresponse and explanatory variables due \r\nto its own association with each of those \r\nvariables. b\r\n&DXWLRQ\r\nIn Example 3, the problem with the \r\nconclusion they made is that schools with \r\nhigh rates of drug use might be more \r\ninclined to employ drug tests to address \r\nthe problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\ntests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\nalso conceivable that drug use rates started \r\nat 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\nthe drug test program. The problem with \r\nthis observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\nknow which of the previous conceivable \r\nscenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\noccurred. b","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>","184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nDetermining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\nIf experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\nbother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\nthan for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\nthe following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\nuse a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\nbody never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\nmore common for those who used cell phones.\r\nThere are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\nj It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\nsubjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\nharmful.\r\nj It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told. How can \r\nyou monitor them to ensure that they adhere to their treatment assignment \r\nover the 50-year experimental period?\r\nj Who wants to wait 50 years to get an answer?\r\nFor these reasons, medical experiments are often performed over a short time \r\nperiod or often with exposure to treatments that would not be out of the ordinary \r\n(such as a one-time exposure to cell phone activity). To measure the effects on \r\npeople of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\nuses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\npopulations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\nwhen we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\nstudies. Then we are not deliberately placing people in harm\u2019s way, but observing \r\npeople who have chosen on their own to take part in the activity of interest. In \r\ntoday\u2019s information age, a lot of data is readily available to assist (or impede) \r\npeople from making decisions about the relationship between variables. These \r\ndata provide only observational comparisons. We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\ngood observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\nexperiment is not practical.\r\nFinally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\nquestions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\nwant to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\nuse a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\nUsing Data Already Available\r\nOf course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\nquestion, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\ninstead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\nyour personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\nphone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\nInformal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\nthere is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\ndisprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\na pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\nassociation does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\nsmoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\nis lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\nA famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\nExamples of sources for available data:\r\nj General Social Survey (GSS)\r\nj http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\nj www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\nj www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\nj www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\nKingdom)\r\nj www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>","Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\nresearch studies.

Excellent sources of available \r\ndata are listed in the margin on the previous page.\r\nThe Census and Other Sample Surveys\r\nThe General Social Survey (GSS) is an example of a sample survey. It gathers in\ufffeformation by interviewing a sample of subjects from the U.S. adult population to \r\nprovide a snapshot of that population. The study in Example 3 on student drug \r\nuse in schools also used a sample survey.\r\n2\r\nMost surveys of research about cell phones suggest that there is no convincing evidence yet of adverse \r\nradiation effects (e.g., D. R. Cox, J. Roy. Statist. Soc., Ser. A, vol. 166, pp. 241\u2013246, 2003). The primary \r\ndanger appears to be people using cell phones while driving!\r\nSample Survey\r\nA sample survey selects a sample of subjects from a population and collects data from \r\nthem. In the field of statistics a survey does not just indicate an opinion poll or a question\ufffenaire; it includes any information gathered from or about the subject.\r\nA sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study. The subjects provide data \r\non the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\nMost countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\nnumber of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\nthem. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\nentire population.\r\nIn Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\nof the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\nmore than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\nthe population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\nj The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\ncensus. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\nseats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\non how their population size compares with other states.\r\nj Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\nj Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\nand local communities.\r\nAlthough it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\npractice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\ncensus bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient. \r\nBecause data are needed regularly on economic variables, such as the unem\ufffeployment rate, the U.S. Bureau of the Census continually takes samples of the \r\npopulation rather than relying solely on the complete census. An example is the \r\nmonthly Current Population Survey, which surveys about 50,000 U.S. house\ufffeholds and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the \r\nUnited States, including the unemployment rate. It is usually more practical, in \r\nterms of time and money, to take a sample rather than to try to measure every\ufffeone in a population.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 45>","186 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nFor a sample survey to be informative, it is important for the sample to reflect \r\nthe population well.

The most commonly discussed characteristic learned from \r\na census is the size of the population. However, other \r\ncharacteristics of the population are measured during \r\neach census.

A nationwide census is conducted \r\nin the United States every 10 years.\r\na. Give at least two reasons the United States takes a census \r\nonly every 10 years.\r\n4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\r\nThe sample survey is a common type of nonexperimental study. The first step of \r\na sample survey is to define the population targeted by the study. For instance, \r\nthe Gallup organization (www.gallup.com) conducts a monthly survey of about \r\n1000 adult Americans. Gallup then reports the percentage of those sampled who \r\nrespond \u201capprove\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way [the \r\ncurrent president of the United States] is handling his job as president?\u201d If the \r\nsampling is conducted properly, this provides a good estimate of the approval \r\nrate within the entire population. The population consists of all adults living in \r\nthe United States.\r\nSampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\nSampling Frame\r\nThe sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\ntaken.\r\nIdeally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\nas in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\nSuppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\nschool. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\nof registered students.\r\nOnce you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\nsubjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\nin your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\nentire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\nseniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\nstudents, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\ndoubtful.\r\nWhen you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\nfrequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\nsurvey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\njob. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\nthan freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\nlarger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\nbe misleading.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>","Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\nSimple Random Sampling\r\nYou\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\nconvenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\nan equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\nout how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\ncorresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\nYou may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\na box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\nfor a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\nSimple Random Sample\r\nA simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\nsample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n5HFDOO\r\nAs in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\nnumber of observations in the sample, \r\ncalled the sample size. b\r\nA simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\nadjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\ndesigns presented in Section 4.4.\r\nSimple random \r\nsamples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nA campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\na dinner banquet and raffle. The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\nof football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\neveryone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once. (This is \r\ncalled sampling without replacement.) To select the two winners, the organiz\ufffeers choose a simple random sample of size n = 2 from the 60 ticket holders. \r\nEach individual at the banquet receives an entry with a number between 1 and \r\n60. Duplicate tickets numbered 1 to 60 are placed in a container and mixed, \r\nafter which the two winning entries are chosen at random. Whoever holds the \r\ntickets containing the same numbers as those drawn at random wins the foot\ufffeball tickets.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. What are the possible samples?\r\nb. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 will be drawn?\r\nc. Professor Shaffer is in attendance at the banquet and holds entry num\ufffeber 1. What is the chance that her entry will be chosen? Mr. Chatterjee \r\nholds entry number 55. What is the chance that his entry will be chosen?\r\nThink It Through\r\na. The entire collection of possible samples is too long to list, but we can \r\nvisualize the possibilities by listing certain pairs:\r\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), . . . , (1,58), (1,59), (1,60)\r\n(2,3), (2,4), . . . , (2,58), (2,59), (2,60)\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nExample 4 ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>","190 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nSelecting a Simple Random Sample\r\nWhat\u2019s a better way to take a simple random sample than blindly drawing slips \r\nof paper out of a hat? You first number the subjects in the sampling frame. You \r\nthen generate a set of those numbers randomly. Finally, you sample the subjects \r\nwhose numbers were generated. One method of generating numbers randomly \r\nis to use a random number table. In practice, technology is used to generate the \r\nsample. This could be an app or a statistical program. The following example \r\ndemonstrates how a random sample is generated in MINITAB (left column).\r\nTaking a Random Sample Consider taking a random sample of three students \r\nfrom a class in which the following students are enrolled: Aisha, Benedict, Chung, \r\nDiego, Emily, Francisco, Girish, Hank, Isabella, and Jing.\r\nIt can be done in MINITAB, as shown below.\r\n'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\nThe Random Numbers web app from \r\nthe book\u2019s website can also be used to \r\ngenerate random numbers. The screenshot \r\nin the margin next to Example 5 on the next \r\npage illustrates. b\r\n(57,58), (57,59), (57,60)\r\n(58,59), (58,60)\r\n(59,60)\r\nb. The first row above contains 59 possible samples, the second row con\ufffetains 58, and so forth. There are thus 59 + 58 + c + 2 + 1, which \r\nequals 1770 possible samples. The process of randomly selecting two \r\nunique entries ensures that each possible sample of size 2 has an equal \r\nchance of occurring. Since there are 1770 possible samples, the chance \r\nof any one sample being selected is 1 out of 1770.\r\nc. Looking at the top row in part a, we see that 1 shows up in 59 of the \r\nsamples (all of the samples listed in the top row). So the chance that \r\nProfessor Shaffer wins season tickets is 59 out of 1770.\r\nInsight\r\nThe chance of 59/1770 for Professor Shaffer is the same as that of \r\nMr.\u00a0Chatterjee and everyone else in attendance. In practice, especially with \r\nlarge populations, it is difficult to mix the entrants\u2019 numbers in a container \r\nso that each sample truly has an equal chance of selection. There are better \r\nways of selecting simple random samples, as we\u2019ll learn next.\r\nc Try Exercise 4.16","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://2a1ab342a4235ad#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60206,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 45>","Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 191\r\nWhen we executed this command in MINITAB, the following random sample \r\nwas obtained.

It \r\nis too time-consuming and expensive for auditors to review all accounts, \r\nso they typically review only some of them. So that a school district cannot \r\nanticipate which accounts will be reviewed, the auditors often take a simple \r\nrandom sample of the accounts.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. How can the auditors use random numbers to select 10 accounts to \r\naudit in a school district that has 60 accounts?\r\nb. Why is it important for the auditors not to use personal judgment in \r\nselecting the accounts to audit?\r\nThink It Through\r\na. The sampling frame consists of the 60 accounts. We first number the \r\naccounts 1 through 60. Alternatively, they could list the names of the \r\naccounts. The accounts MINITAB selected (see below for details of \r\nthe process) were 56, 43, 35, 47, 15, 8, 31, 9, 33, and 36. We cannot \r\nverify that these numbers are randomly selected, but we know that the \r\nprocess used to generate them employs random selection.\r\nb. By using simple random sampling, the auditors hold the school district \r\nresponsible for all accounts. If the auditors personally chose the ac\ufffecounts to audit, they might select certain accounts each year. A school \r\ndistrict would soon learn which accounts they need to have in order \r\nand which accounts can be given less attention.\r\nInsight\r\nLikewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) randomly selects some tax re\ufffeturns for audit, so taxpayers cannot predict ahead of time whether they will \r\nbe audited. For efficiency, the IRS samples a small proportion of tax returns \r\nwith small amounts owed and a larger proportion of tax returns with high \r\namounts owed. It does this because it cares about the total amount of tax \r\nrevenue brought in.\r\nc Try Exercise 4.17\r\nExample 5 \r\nMethods of Collecting Data in Sample Surveys\r\nIn Example 5, the subjects sampled were accounts. More commonly, they are \r\npeople. For any survey, it is difficult to get a good sampling frame since a list of \r\nall adults in a population typically does not exist. So, it\u2019s necessary to pick a place \r\nwhere almost all people can be found\u2014a person\u2019s place of residence.\r\nOnce we identify the desired sample for a survey, how do we contact the \r\npeople to collect the data?

An advantage is that \r\nsubjects are more likely to participate. A disadvantage is the cost. Also, some sub\ufffejects may not answer sensitive questions pertaining to opinions or lifestyle, such \r\nas alcohol and drug use, whether they have been victims of sexual abuse, or their \r\nHIV status that they might answer on a printed questionnaire.\r\nTelephone interview A telephone interview is like a personal interview but \r\nconducted over the phone. A main advantage is lower cost because no travel is \r\ninvolved. A disadvantage is that the interview might have to be short. Subjects \r\ngenerally aren\u2019t as patient on the phone and may hang up before starting or com\ufffepleting the interview.\r\nSelf-administered questionnaire Subjects are requested to fill out a questionnaire \r\nmailed, e-mailed, or otherwise available online. An advantage is that it is cheaper \r\nthan a personal interview. A disadvantage is that fewer people tend to participate.\r\nSo which method is most used? Most major national polls that survey regularly \r\nto measure public opinion use the telephone interview. An example is the polls \r\nconducted by the Gallup organization. The General Social Survey is an exception, \r\nusing personal interviews for its questionnaire, which is quite long.\r\nFor telephone interviews, since the mid-1980s, many sample surveys have used \r\nrandom digit dialing to select households. The survey can then obtain a sample \r\nwithout having a sampling frame. In the United States, typically the area code \r\nand the 3-digit exchange are randomly selected from the list of all such codes and \r\nexchanges. Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\nrandomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\nrandomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\nlikely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\nexactly one telephone?)\r\nSources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\nA variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\nthe population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\nof the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\nBesides Gallup, there are other polling \r\ngroups that conduct national surveys, \r\nsuch\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\npeople-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n(www.zogby.com).

The main way \r\nthis occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\nundercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\nthe population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\nprison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\nconsists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\nlandlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\nthose who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\nare in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\nsampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\nNonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\ncannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\nsubjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\nin some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\nissues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\nquestions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\nsuffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\ntelephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\nnonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\nonly about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\ncontact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\nResults have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\nin her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\nfeminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\nStates. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\nleast five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\nquestionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\nlarge. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\nknow whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\nof the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\nadult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\nof using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\nResponse bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\nThis is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\nway, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\nlie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\nthe response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\nIf you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\nquestions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\nlong, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\nRoper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II. In response to \r\nthe question, \u201cDoes it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the \r\nNazi extermination of the Jews never happened?\u201d 22% said it was possible the \r\nHolocaust never happened. The Roper organization later admitted that the ques\ufffetion was worded in a confusing manner. When it asked, \u201cDoes it seem possible \r\nto you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel \r\ncertain that it happened?\u201d only 1% said it was possible it never happened.4\r\nEven the order in which questions are asked can dramatically influence re\ufffesults.

The results of an opinion \r\nsurvey asking about raising the sales \r\ntax to support public schools may \r\nbe biased in the direction of raising \r\ntaxes if you sample only educators \r\nor biased in the direction of lowering \r\ntaxes if you sample only business \r\nowners.

Two sampling methods that may \r\nbe necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\nConvenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\nbut rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\nrelatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\nmay result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\nof the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\nbe underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\nand 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\ninterviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\nstudy about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\nVolunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\nthe Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\ntype, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\nAs the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\npopulation may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\nhave stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\nsite. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\nCenter (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\nregister their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n(Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\nRepublicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\nof online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\nthan the general population.\r\nConvenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\nboth in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\nstudies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\nto a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\nfind a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\nmedical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\nwherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\nthe new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\nSome samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>","Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\nA poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nThe Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\npresidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\nand Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\nbecause they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\nLiterary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\nplanned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n2.3 million people returned the questionnaire. The Digest predicted that \r\nLandon would win, getting 57% of the vote. Instead, Landon actually got only \r\n36%, and Roosevelt won in a landslide.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. What was the population?\r\nb. How could the Literary Digest poll make such a large error, especially \r\nwith such a huge sample size? What type of bias occurred in this poll?\r\nThink It Through\r\na. The population was all registered voters in the United States in 1936.\r\nb. This survey had two severe problems:\r\nj Sampling bias due to undercoverage of the sampling frame and a \r\nnonrandom sample: In 1936, the United States was in the Great \r\nDepression. Those who had cars and country club memberships \r\nand thus received questionnaires tended to be wealthy. The wealthy \r\ntended to be primarily Republican, the political party of Landon. \r\nMany potential voters were not on the lists used for the sampling \r\nframe. There was also no guarantee that a subject in the sampling \r\nframe was a registered voter.\r\nj Nonresponse bias: Of the 10 million people who received question\ufffenaires, 7.7 million did not respond. As might be expected, those \r\nindividuals who were unhappy with the incumbent (Roosevelt) were \r\nmore likely to respond.\r\nInsight\r\nFor this same election, a pollster who was getting his new polling agency off the \r\nground surveyed 50,000 people and predicted that Roosevelt would win. Who \r\nwas this pollster? George Gallup. The Gallup organization is still with us today. \r\nHowever, the Literary Digest went out of business soon after the 1936 election.6\r\nc Try Exercise 4.24\r\nExample 6 \r\nA Large Sample Size Does Not Guarantee \r\nan\u00a0Unbiased Sample\r\nMany people think that as long as the sample size is large, it doesn\u2019t matter how \r\nthe sample was selected.

Many Internet surveys have \r\nthousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\nas a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller. We\u2019re almost \r\nalways better off with a simple random sample of 100 people than with a volunteer \r\nsample of thousands of people.\r\nSUMMARY: Key Parts of a Sample Survey\r\nj Identify the population of all the subjects of interest.\r\nj Define a sampling frame, which attempts to list all the subjects in the population.\r\nj Use a random sampling design, implemented using random numbers, to select n\r\nsubjects from the sampling frame.\r\nj Be cautious about sampling bias due to nonrandom samples (such as volunteer \r\nsamples) and sample undercoverage, response bias from subjects not giving their \r\ntrue response or from poorly worded questions, and nonresponse bias from refusal \r\nof subjects to participate.\r\nIn Section 4.1 we learned that experimental studies are preferable to nonex\ufffeperimental studies but are not always possible. Some types of nonexperimental \r\nstudies have fewer potential pitfalls than others. For a sample survey with random \r\nsampling, we can make inferences about the population of interest. By contrast, \r\nwith a study using a convenience sample, results apply only to those subjects actu\ufffeally observed. For this reason, some researchers use the term observational study\r\nto refer only to studies that use available subjects (such as a convenience sample) \r\nand not to sample surveys that randomly select their sample.\r\n4.15 Choosing officers A campus club consists of five officers: \r\npresident (P), vice president (V), secretary (S), treasurer \r\n(T), and activity coordinator (A).

First, let\u2019s recall the \r\ndefinition of an experimental study from Section 4.1: We assign each subject to an \r\nexperimental condition, called a treatment. We then observe the outcome on the \r\nresponse variable. The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\nhow the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\nover a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\nIn an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\nname emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\ncould, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\nThe Elements of a Good Experiment\r\nLet\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\nIt is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\nreported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\nSome scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\nan antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\nstudy whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\nFor this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\ncannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\na medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\nwould like to quit.\r\nControl comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\nquit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\ntaking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\nPerhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n You need \r\nto be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\nnot taking the antidepressant.\r\n8\r\nChapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\nover time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>","Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\nAn experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\nan antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\nhelp you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\nshould be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\nother group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\nantidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\nsecond group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\nrelapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\nleast by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\nrate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\nWhy bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\nany active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\nto the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\nare receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\nbetter than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\nis called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\nplacebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\nsubjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\nantidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\ncontrol group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\ncompared to the placebo group.\r\nIn some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\nthan a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\nan antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\nIt may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\npatch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\na placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\nnicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\nRandomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\nsubjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\ntreatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\nthe study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\nsubconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\ngroup that receives the antidepressant.\r\nIt is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\nthe 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\ncontrol group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\nyounger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\nmaking them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\nThis enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\nthey are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\nYou might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\njudgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\nto its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\nage in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\ntreatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\nto be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n(2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\nbalance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\none treatment.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>","200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nYou can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\nthey come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\nan experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\nAn analysis9\r\n of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\nindicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\nin studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\nstudies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\nresults that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n9\r\nSee Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\nSUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\nUse randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\nj To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\nj To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\nj To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\nBlinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\nequally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\nthey are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\nwhether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\nwith the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\nthe subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\ntreatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\ncigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\ndouble-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\nStudy design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nTo investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\nused 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\nor more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\nquit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\ntook 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\nThe other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\nstudy observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na.

When an experiment \r\nuses a convenience sample, be cautious about the extent to which results gener\ufffealize to a larger population. Look carefully at the characteristics of the sample. \r\nDo they seem representative of the overall population? If not, the results have \r\ndubious worth.\r\nb.

This experiment has\r\nResponse variable: Whether the subject abstains from smoking for \r\none year (yes or no)\r\nExplanatory variable: Whether the subject received bupropion (yes \r\nor no)\r\nTreatments: bupropion, no bupropion\r\nExperimental units: The 429 volunteers who are the study subjects\r\nb. The researchers should randomize to assign subjects to the two treat\ufffements. They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\nof the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\nto the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group). The \r\nprocedure would be as follows:\r\nj Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\nj Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\nbupropion group.\r\nj Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\nvalues between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\nwill receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n control group.\r\nc. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\nwhether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\nsources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\nabstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\nInsight\r\nIn the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\nyear, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\nwith 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\nwere not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\nextended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\nalternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\nof observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\nwith humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\nor more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\nSample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\nDesigns\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\nSimple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\nIn practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\nor are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\nSometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\nCluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\nframe\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\ninformation is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\nstudy of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\nstudents can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\nobserving each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\nFor instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\nyour city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\ncity blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\nthen select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\nCluster Random Sample\r\nDivide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\nrandom sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\ncluster random sample.\r\nFor personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\nsampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\nmany observations quickly and with little travel.\r\nSUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\nRandom\u00a0Sample\r\nCluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\nj A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\nj The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\nThe disadvantages are:\r\nj We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\nof precision.\r\nj Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>","Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\nStratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\nnumber of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement. The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\nn = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\njuniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\none of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\nstudent directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\nsampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\nstill having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\nThis type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\nStratified Random Sample\r\nA stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\nbased on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\nrandom sample from each stratum.\r\nStratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\neach subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\nin your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\nstudents who work and who don\u2019t work. However, this information may not be \r\navailable for each student.\r\nSUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Stratified \r\nRandom\u00a0Sample\r\nStratified random sampling has the\r\nj Advantage that you can include in your sample enough subjects in each group \r\n(stratum) you want to evaluate.\r\nj Disadvantage that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into \r\nwhich each subject belongs.\r\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a stratified sample and a cluster sample? A \r\nstratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\namong sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n(cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\nrandom sample).\r\nIn addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\nbased on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\nand can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\nbe defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\nComparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\nensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\ndesign should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\nmethods we\u2019ve presented.\r\nIn practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\nout a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n(1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>","206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nthem, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\nelection district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\nbe infeasible.\r\nMarketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\nrandomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\nconsumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\nSocial Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\nstratification and clustering.\r\nIn future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\nrandom sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\nsampling.

With an observational study, it\u2019s possible that an association \r\nis due to some lurking variable. However, observational studies do have advan\ufffetages. It\u2019s often not practical to conduct an experiment. For instance, with human \r\nsubjects it\u2019s not ethical to design an experiment to study the long-term effect of \r\ncell phone use on getting cancer. Nevertheless, it is possible to design an observa\ufffetional study that controls for identified lurking variables.\r\nRather than taking a cross section of a population at some time, such as with \r\na sample survey, some studies are backward looking (retrospective) or forward \r\nlooking (prospective). Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\nHow can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\nuse and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\nof subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\nand then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups. This approach \r\nwas first applied to study smoking and lung cancer.\r\nRetrospective \r\nstudies b Lung Cancer and Smoking\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nIn 1950 in London, England, medical statisticians Austin Bradford Hill and \r\nRichard Doll conducted one of the first studies linking smoking and lung cancer. \r\nIn 20 hospitals, they matched 709 patients admitted with lung cancer in the pre\ufffeceding year with 709 noncancer patients at the same hospital of the same gender \r\nand within the same five-year grouping on age. All patients were queried about \r\ntheir smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\nleast one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\nto look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\nTable 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\nwere the patients with lung cancer.

The lung \r\ncancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\nInsight\r\nAn inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\nThis suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\nc Try Exercise 4.46\r\nCase-Control Study\r\nA case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\na\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\noutcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\nThis is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\nethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\nsmoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\npotential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\nvariables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\nand hospital.\r\nIn a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\nfixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\nFor instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\ntime to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\nthe explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\nor control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\nsubjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\nhalf the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\nhad lung cancer.\r\n,Q:RUGV\r\nIn Example 8, the response \r\noutcome of interest was having lung \r\ncancer.

In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\nrandomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\ncases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\neye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\nsubjects with the cases.\r\nQuestion to Explore\r\nWhy might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\nsuch as age?\r\nExample 9 ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>","Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\nProspective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\ninto the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\nThink It Through\r\nWe\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\nsuch as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\nwere observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\nresearchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\nvariables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\nprovides.\r\nWhen researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\nrelationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\nis not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\neffects of lurking variables.\r\nInsight\r\nThe lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\nthe two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\nfinding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\nto be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\nusers of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\nc Try Exercise 4.47\r\nProspective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nThe Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\nbegan in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years. The purpose of \r\nthe study was to explore relationships among diet, hormonal factors, smok\ufffeing habits, and exercise habits, and the risk of coronary heart disease, pul\ufffemonary disease, and stroke. Since the initial survey in 1976, the nurses have \r\nfilled out a questionnaire every two years.\r\nQuestion to Explore\r\nWhat does it mean for this observational study to be called prospective?\r\nThink It Through\r\nThe retrospective smoking study in Example 8 looked to the past to learn \r\nwhether its lung cancer subjects had been smokers.

No, we \r\ncannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\nwas observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\nhave caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\nsmoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\nconducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\ntime, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\nof lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\nretrospective and prospective, have added more evidence. For example, when a \r\nprospective study begun in 1951 with 35,000 doctors ended in 2001, researchers12\r\nestimated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who \r\nnever quit. This study estimated that at least half the people who smoke from \r\nyouth are eventually killed by their habit.\r\nMost important, studies carried out on different populations of people have \r\nconsistently concluded that smoking is associated with lung cancer, even after ad\ufffejusting for all potentially confounding variables that researchers have suggested. \r\nAs more studies are done that adjust for confounding variables, the chance that a \r\nlurking variable remains that can explain the association is reduced.

Medical experiments often do this to compare treat\ufffements for chronic conditions that do not have a permanent cure.\r\nTo illustrate, suppose a study plans to compare an oral drug and a placebo for \r\ntreating migraine headaches.

For in\ufffestance, any difference observed between the drug and the placebo responses is \r\nnot because subjects taking the drug had better overall health. Another example \r\nof a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\nAn additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types. In each field, two \r\nplots are marked, one for each fertilizer. Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\nbe more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\nIf we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\nfertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\napplied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\ncan\u2019t use many fields.\r\nBlocking in an Experiment\r\nThe matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements. The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\nThe crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\nIn experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\nto as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\nwithin blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\nstudy, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\nso they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\nTo reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\nIn the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\nbe randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\neffect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\nthe second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\nassigned to the plots in a field.\r\nculprit. They were also pioneers in developing a sound theo\uffferetical basis for the case-control method. They followed their \r\ninitial study with other case-control studies and with a long-term \r\nprospective study that showed that smoking was not only the \r\npredominant risk factor for lung cancer but also correlated with \r\nother diseases.\r\nAt first, Bradford Hill was cautious about claiming that \r\nsmoking causes lung cancer.

These are categories of \r\nthe explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\nis then observed for each subject.\r\nj An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\nthat observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\nobserves rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\nSince association does not imply causation, with observational \r\nstudies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\ninfluence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\nrandomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\nto the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\nvariables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\ncausation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\nwith neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\ntreatment a subject was assigned.\r\nA sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\na sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\nincorporate random sampling.\r\nj A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\nin which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\nbeing selected.\r\nj A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\nclusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\nas the sample.\r\nj A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\ngroups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\nfrom each stratum.\r\nBe cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\nsuch as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\nrandom sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\nnonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\nare biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\nMost sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\nwith many experiments. Medical studies often use retrospective\r\nobservational studies, which look at subjects\u2019 behavior in the past.\r\nj A case-control study is an example of a retrospective study. \r\nSubjects who have a response outcome of interest, such as \r\ncancer, serve as cases. Other subjects not having that outcome \r\nserve as controls. The cases and controls are compared on an \r\nexplanatory variable, such as whether they had been smokers.\r\nA categorical explanatory variable in an experiment is also called a \r\nfactor. Multifactor experiments have at least two explanatory vari\ufffeables. With a completely randomized design, subjects are assigned \r\nrandomly to categories of each explanatory variable. Some designs \r\ninstead use blocks\u2014sets of experimental units that are matched. \r\nMatched-pairs designs have two observations in each block. Often \r\nthis is the same subject observed for each of two treatments, such as \r\nin a crossover study.\r\nData are only as good as the method used to obtain them. \r\nUnless we use a good study design, conclusions may be faulty.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 45>","Chapter Problems 217\r\nc.

It states that \u201cresearch \r\nfor the Bar found that over 40 percent of female junior \r\ntenants said they had encountered sexual harassment \r\nduring their time at the Bar.\u201d This was based on a study \r\nconducted at the University of Sheffield that sent a \r\nquestionnaire to 334 junior tenants at the Bar, of whom \r\n159 responded. Of the 159, 67 were female. Of those \r\nfemales, 3 said they had experienced sexual harassment \r\nas a major problem, and 24 had experienced it as a slight \r\nproblem.\r\na. The quoted statement might be misleading because \r\nthe nonresponse was large.\r\nb. No one was forced to respond, so everyone had a \r\nchance to be in the sample, which implies it was a \r\nsimple random sample.\r\nc. This was an example of a completely randomized \r\n experiment, with whether a female junior tenant \r\n experienced sexual harassment as the response \r\nvariable.\r\nd. This was a retrospective case-control study, with those \r\nwho received sexual harassment as the cases.\r\n4.103 Multiple choice: Effect of response categories A study \r\n(N. Schwarz et al., Public Opinion Quarterly, vol. 49, 1985, \r\np. 388) asked German adults how many hours a day they \r\nspend watching TV on a typical day. When the possible \r\nresponses were the six categories (up to 1\r\n2 hour, 1\r\n2 to 1 hour, \r\n1 to 11\r\n2 hours, . . . , more than 21\r\n2 hours), 16% of respondents \r\nsaid they watched more than 21\r\n2 hours per day. When the \r\nsix categories were (up to 21\r\n2 hours, 21\r\n2 to 3 hours, . . . , more \r\nthan 4 hours), 38% said they watched more than 21\r\n2 hours \r\nper day.\r\na.

She selects \r\nsubjects by picking one of the first 100 on the list at ran\ufffedom, skipping 100 names to get the next subject, skipping \r\nanother 100 names to get the next subject, and so on. \r\nThis is called a systematic random sample.\r\na.

The most convenient sampling design is to use our \r\neyes to pick five states from the map that we think \r\nhave areas representative of all the states.

Cell \r\nphones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\nmain source of this energy. The closer \r\nthe antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\ngreater the exposure to radiation. \r\nWith the increased use of cell phones, \r\nthere has been a growing concern \r\nover the potential health risks. Several \r\nstudies have explored the possibility \r\nof such risks:\r\nStudy 1 A German study (Stang \r\net\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\nwith a rare form of eye cancer called \r\nuveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n patients who did not have this eye \r\ncancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\nwas measured using a questionnaire. \r\nOn average, the eye cancer patients \r\nused cell phones more often.\r\nStudy 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\net al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\nwith brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\nwithout brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\ncell phone use was measured using a \r\nquestionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\ntwo groups was similar.\r\nStudy 3 A study published in The \r\nJournal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\nthat cell phone use speeds up activity \r\nin the brain. As part of a randomized \r\ncrossover study, 47 participants were \r\nfitted with a cell phone device on each \r\near and then underwent two positron \r\nemission topography, or PET, scans \r\nto measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\nDuring one scan, the cell phones were \r\nboth turned off. During the other \r\nscan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\ncall was made to the phone on the \r\nright ear. The order of when the call \r\nwas received (for the first or second \r\nscan) was randomized. Comparison \r\nof the PET scans showed a significant \r\nincrease in activity in the part of the \r\nbrain closest to the antenna during \r\nthe transmission of the automated \r\ncall.\r\nStudies 1 and 3 found potential \r\nphysiological responses to cell \r\nphone use.

In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\nlearn that the study design can have \r\na major impact on its results. Unless \r\nthe study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\nThroughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\nto the cell phone studies introduced in \r\nExample 1 to ask more questions and \r\nunderstand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\nto infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\nWe use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\nExample 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\nor eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\nindividuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\nsamples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\ninterest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\nis whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\namount of cell phone use.\r\nTypes of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\nSome studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\nassigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\nwe want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\ncalled treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n5HFDOO\r\nFrom Section 1.2, the population consists \r\nof all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\ndata on a subset of the population, which \r\nwe call the sample.\r\nFrom the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\nresponse variable measures the outcome \r\nof interest. Studies investigate how that \r\noutcome depends on the explanatory \r\nvariable. b\r\nExperimental Study\r\nA researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\nsubjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\nvariable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\nthe explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\nFor example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\nstudy, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>","Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\nof the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\nthe experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\nresponse variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\nit increased.\r\nAn experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\nin the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\nBy contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\nand the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\nthem. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\nObservational Study\r\nIn an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\nexplanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\nIn short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\nthe study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\ntreatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\nIdentifying experimental \r\nversus observational \r\nstudies\r\nb\r\nCell Phone Use\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nExample 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\nbetween cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body. We\u2019ve \r\nseen that Study 3 was an experiment. Studies 1 and 2 both examined the \r\namount of cell phone use for cancer patients and for noncancer patients us\ufffeing a questionnaire.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. Were Studies 1 and 2 experimental or observational studies?\r\nb. How were Studies 1 and 2 fundamentally different from Study 3 in \r\nterms of how the treatments were determined for each subject?\r\nThink It Through\r\na. In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\ngathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\ndetermined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\nobserved this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\nand 2 were observational studies.\r\nb. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\nthe subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\nto both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\nduring the second scan. The researchers imposed the treatments on \r\nthe subjects. So, Study 3 was an experimental study.*\r\nExample 2 \r\n*The researchers noted that \u201cResults of this study provide evidence that acute cell phone expo\ufffesure affects brain metabolic activity. However, these results provide no information about their \r\nrelevance to potential carcinogenic effects (or lack thereof) from chronic cell phone use.\u201d","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>","182 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nLet\u2019s consider another study. From its description, we\u2019ll try to determine \r\nwhether it is an experiment or an observational study.\r\nInsight\r\nOne reason that results of different medical studies sometimes disagree is \r\nthat they are not the same type of study. Experimental studies allow direct \r\ncausal inference to be made, whereas observational studies do not allow \r\ncausal inference. As we\u2019ll see, there are different types of both observational \r\nand experimental studies, and some are more trustworthy than others.\r\nc Try Exercises 4.1 and 4.3\r\n1\r\nStudy by R. Yamaguchi et al., reported in Journal of School Health, vol. 73, pp. 159\u2013164, 2003.\r\nExperiment or \r\nobservational study b Drug Testing and Student Drug Use\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\n\u201cStudent Drug Testing Not Effective in Reducing Drug Use\u201d was the headline \r\nin a news release from the University of Michigan. It reported results from a \r\nstudy of 76,000 students in 497 high schools and 225 middle schools nation\ufffewide.1\r\n Each student in the study filled out a questionnaire. One question asked \r\nwhether the student used drugs. The study found that drug use was similar \r\nin schools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. For \r\ninstance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\ntwelfth graders from the two types of schools. In addition, the figure in the \r\nmargin shows the conditional proportions of drug use for these students.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. What were the response and explanatory variables?\r\nb. Was this an observational study or an experiment?\r\nExample 3 \r\nDrug Use\r\nDrug Tests? Yes No Total\r\nYes 2,092 3,561 5,653\r\nNo 6,452 10,985 17,437\r\nThink It Through\r\na. The study compared the percentage of students who used drugs in \r\nschools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. \r\nWhether the student used drugs was the response variable. The ex\ufffeplanatory variable was whether the student\u2019s school tested for drugs. \r\nBoth variables were categorical, with categories \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d \r\nFor each grade, the data were summarized in a contingency table, as \r\nshown in the margin for twelfth graders.\r\nb. For each student, the study merely observed whether his or her school \r\ntested for drugs and whether he or she used drugs. So this was an ob\ufffeservational study.\r\nInsight\r\nAn experiment would have assigned schools to use or not use drug testing \r\nrather than leaving the decision to the schools. For instance, the study could \r\nhave randomly selected half the schools to perform drug testing and half not to \r\nperform it and then, a year later, measured the student drug use in each school.\r\nc Try Exercise 4.7","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://568e66fa8c8c602#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":70436,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 45>","Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 183\r\nAs we will soon discuss, an experimental study gives the researcher more control \r\nover outside influences. This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\nassociation.\r\nAdvantage of Experiments Over \r\nObservational\u00a0Studies\r\nIn an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\nExample 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\nthere could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\ncancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\nwho do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\na possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\nphones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\nscreens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\neye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\nBy contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\nthe results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\nwhich subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\ngroups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\nsimilar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\nto have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\ncondition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\nthe subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\nthe amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\nwhich subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\nsubjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\nbe much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\nand the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\nwhether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\nnot affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\nOne treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\ndifferences, on the average.\r\nIn Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\nsubject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\norder in which the subject received the treatment.\r\nEstablishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\nestablish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\nassociation. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\neye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\nstudy, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\nimply causation.\r\nBecause it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\nexperiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\nwith an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\nwhich treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\nexplanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\ndiscovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\nconduct an experiment.\r\n5HFDOO\r\nFrom Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\na variable not observed in the study that \r\ninfluences the association between the \r\nresponse and explanatory variables due \r\nto its own association with each of those \r\nvariables. b\r\n&DXWLRQ\r\nIn Example 3, the problem with the \r\nconclusion they made is that schools with \r\nhigh rates of drug use might be more \r\ninclined to employ drug tests to address \r\nthe problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\ntests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\nalso conceivable that drug use rates started \r\nat 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\nthe drug test program. The problem with \r\nthis observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\nknow which of the previous conceivable \r\nscenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\noccurred. b","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>","184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nDetermining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\nIf experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\nbother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\nthan for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\nthe following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\nuse a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\nbody never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\nmore common for those who used cell phones.\r\nThere are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\nj It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\nsubjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\nharmful.\r\nj It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told. How can \r\nyou monitor them to ensure that they adhere to their treatment assignment \r\nover the 50-year experimental period?\r\nj Who wants to wait 50 years to get an answer?\r\nFor these reasons, medical experiments are often performed over a short time \r\nperiod or often with exposure to treatments that would not be out of the ordinary \r\n(such as a one-time exposure to cell phone activity). To measure the effects on \r\npeople of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\nuses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\npopulations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\nwhen we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\nstudies. Then we are not deliberately placing people in harm\u2019s way, but observing \r\npeople who have chosen on their own to take part in the activity of interest. In \r\ntoday\u2019s information age, a lot of data is readily available to assist (or impede) \r\npeople from making decisions about the relationship between variables. These \r\ndata provide only observational comparisons. We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\ngood observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\nexperiment is not practical.\r\nFinally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\nquestions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\nwant to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\nuse a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\nUsing Data Already Available\r\nOf course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\nquestion, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\ninstead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\nyour personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\nphone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\nInformal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\nthere is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\ndisprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\na pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\nassociation does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\nsmoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\nis lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\nA famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\nExamples of sources for available data:\r\nj General Social Survey (GSS)\r\nj http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\nj www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\nj www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\nj www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\nKingdom)\r\nj www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>","Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\nresearch studies.

Excellent sources of available \r\ndata are listed in the margin on the previous page.\r\nThe Census and Other Sample Surveys\r\nThe General Social Survey (GSS) is an example of a sample survey. It gathers in\ufffeformation by interviewing a sample of subjects from the U.S. adult population to \r\nprovide a snapshot of that population. The study in Example 3 on student drug \r\nuse in schools also used a sample survey.\r\n2\r\nMost surveys of research about cell phones suggest that there is no convincing evidence yet of adverse \r\nradiation effects (e.g., D. R. Cox, J. Roy. Statist. Soc., Ser. A, vol. 166, pp. 241\u2013246, 2003). The primary \r\ndanger appears to be people using cell phones while driving!\r\nSample Survey\r\nA sample survey selects a sample of subjects from a population and collects data from \r\nthem. In the field of statistics a survey does not just indicate an opinion poll or a question\ufffenaire; it includes any information gathered from or about the subject.\r\nA sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study. The subjects provide data \r\non the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\nMost countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\nnumber of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\nthem. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\nentire population.\r\nIn Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\nof the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\nmore than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\nthe population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\nj The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\ncensus. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\nseats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\non how their population size compares with other states.\r\nj Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\nj Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\nand local communities.\r\nAlthough it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\npractice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\ncensus bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient. \r\nBecause data are needed regularly on economic variables, such as the unem\ufffeployment rate, the U.S. Bureau of the Census continually takes samples of the \r\npopulation rather than relying solely on the complete census. An example is the \r\nmonthly Current Population Survey, which surveys about 50,000 U.S. house\ufffeholds and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the \r\nUnited States, including the unemployment rate. It is usually more practical, in \r\nterms of time and money, to take a sample rather than to try to measure every\ufffeone in a population.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 45>","186 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nFor a sample survey to be informative, it is important for the sample to reflect \r\nthe population well.

Give at least two reasons the United States takes a census \r\nonly every 10 years.\r\n4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\r\nThe sample survey is a common type of nonexperimental study. The first step of \r\na sample survey is to define the population targeted by the study. For instance, \r\nthe Gallup organization (www.gallup.com) conducts a monthly survey of about \r\n1000 adult Americans. Gallup then reports the percentage of those sampled who \r\nrespond \u201capprove\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way [the \r\ncurrent president of the United States] is handling his job as president?\u201d If the \r\nsampling is conducted properly, this provides a good estimate of the approval \r\nrate within the entire population. The population consists of all adults living in \r\nthe United States.\r\nSampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\nSampling Frame\r\nThe sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\ntaken.\r\nIdeally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\nas in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\nSuppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\nschool. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\nof registered students.\r\nOnce you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\nsubjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\nin your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\nentire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\nseniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\nstudents, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\ndoubtful.\r\nWhen you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\nfrequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\nsurvey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\njob. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\nthan freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\nlarger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\nbe misleading.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>","Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\nSimple Random Sampling\r\nYou\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\nconvenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\nan equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\nout how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\ncorresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\nYou may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\na box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\nfor a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\nSimple Random Sample\r\nA simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\nsample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n5HFDOO\r\nAs in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\nnumber of observations in the sample, \r\ncalled the sample size. b\r\nA simple random sample is often just called a random sample.

The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\nof football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\neveryone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once. (This is \r\ncalled sampling without replacement.) To select the two winners, the organiz\ufffeers choose a simple random sample of size n = 2 from the 60 ticket holders. \r\nEach individual at the banquet receives an entry with a number between 1 and \r\n60. Duplicate tickets numbered 1 to 60 are placed in a container and mixed, \r\nafter which the two winning entries are chosen at random. Whoever holds the \r\ntickets containing the same numbers as those drawn at random wins the foot\ufffeball tickets.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. What are the possible samples?\r\nb.

The entire collection of possible samples is too long to list, but we can \r\nvisualize the possibilities by listing certain pairs:\r\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), . . . , (1,58), (1,59), (1,60)\r\n(2,3), (2,4), . . . , (2,58), (2,59), (2,60)\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nExample 4 ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>","190 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nSelecting a Simple Random Sample\r\nWhat\u2019s a better way to take a simple random sample than blindly drawing slips \r\nof paper out of a hat? You first number the subjects in the sampling frame. You \r\nthen generate a set of those numbers randomly. Finally, you sample the subjects \r\nwhose numbers were generated. One method of generating numbers randomly \r\nis to use a random number table. In practice, technology is used to generate the \r\nsample. This could be an app or a statistical program. The following example \r\ndemonstrates how a random sample is generated in MINITAB (left column).\r\nTaking a Random Sample Consider taking a random sample of three students \r\nfrom a class in which the following students are enrolled: Aisha, Benedict, Chung, \r\nDiego, Emily, Francisco, Girish, Hank, Isabella, and Jing.\r\nIt can be done in MINITAB, as shown below.\r\n'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\nThe Random Numbers web app from \r\nthe book\u2019s website can also be used to \r\ngenerate random numbers.

The first row above contains 59 possible samples, the second row con\ufffetains 58, and so forth. There are thus 59 + 58 + c + 2 + 1, which \r\nequals 1770 possible samples. The process of randomly selecting two \r\nunique entries ensures that each possible sample of size 2 has an equal \r\nchance of occurring. Since there are 1770 possible samples, the chance \r\nof any one sample being selected is 1 out of 1770.\r\nc. Looking at the top row in part a, we see that 1 shows up in 59 of the \r\nsamples (all of the samples listed in the top row). So the chance that \r\nProfessor Shaffer wins season tickets is 59 out of 1770.\r\nInsight\r\nThe chance of 59/1770 for Professor Shaffer is the same as that of \r\nMr.\u00a0Chatterjee and everyone else in attendance. In practice, especially with \r\nlarge populations, it is difficult to mix the entrants\u2019 numbers in a container \r\nso that each sample truly has an equal chance of selection.

It \r\nis too time-consuming and expensive for auditors to review all accounts, \r\nso they typically review only some of them. So that a school district cannot \r\nanticipate which accounts will be reviewed, the auditors often take a simple \r\nrandom sample of the accounts.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. How can the auditors use random numbers to select 10 accounts to \r\naudit in a school district that has 60 accounts?\r\nb. Why is it important for the auditors not to use personal judgment in \r\nselecting the accounts to audit?\r\nThink It Through\r\na. The sampling frame consists of the 60 accounts. We first number the \r\naccounts 1 through 60. Alternatively, they could list the names of the \r\naccounts. The accounts MINITAB selected (see below for details of \r\nthe process) were 56, 43, 35, 47, 15, 8, 31, 9, 33, and 36. We cannot \r\nverify that these numbers are randomly selected, but we know that the \r\nprocess used to generate them employs random selection.\r\nb. By using simple random sampling, the auditors hold the school district \r\nresponsible for all accounts. If the auditors personally chose the ac\ufffecounts to audit, they might select certain accounts each year. A school \r\ndistrict would soon learn which accounts they need to have in order \r\nand which accounts can be given less attention.\r\nInsight\r\nLikewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) randomly selects some tax re\ufffeturns for audit, so taxpayers cannot predict ahead of time whether they will \r\nbe audited. For efficiency, the IRS samples a small proportion of tax returns \r\nwith small amounts owed and a larger proportion of tax returns with high \r\namounts owed. It does this because it cares about the total amount of tax \r\nrevenue brought in.\r\nc Try Exercise 4.17\r\nExample 5 \r\nMethods of Collecting Data in Sample Surveys\r\nIn Example 5, the subjects sampled were accounts. More commonly, they are \r\npeople. For any survey, it is difficult to get a good sampling frame since a list of \r\nall adults in a population typically does not exist. So, it\u2019s necessary to pick a place \r\nwhere almost all people can be found\u2014a person\u2019s place of residence.\r\nOnce we identify the desired sample for a survey, how do we contact the \r\npeople to collect the data?

An advantage is that \r\nsubjects are more likely to participate. A disadvantage is the cost. Also, some sub\ufffejects may not answer sensitive questions pertaining to opinions or lifestyle, such \r\nas alcohol and drug use, whether they have been victims of sexual abuse, or their \r\nHIV status that they might answer on a printed questionnaire.\r\nTelephone interview A telephone interview is like a personal interview but \r\nconducted over the phone. A main advantage is lower cost because no travel is \r\ninvolved. A disadvantage is that the interview might have to be short. Subjects \r\ngenerally aren\u2019t as patient on the phone and may hang up before starting or com\ufffepleting the interview.\r\nSelf-administered questionnaire Subjects are requested to fill out a questionnaire \r\nmailed, e-mailed, or otherwise available online. An advantage is that it is cheaper \r\nthan a personal interview. A disadvantage is that fewer people tend to participate.\r\nSo which method is most used? Most major national polls that survey regularly \r\nto measure public opinion use the telephone interview. An example is the polls \r\nconducted by the Gallup organization. The General Social Survey is an exception, \r\nusing personal interviews for its questionnaire, which is quite long.\r\nFor telephone interviews, since the mid-1980s, many sample surveys have used \r\nrandom digit dialing to select households. The survey can then obtain a sample \r\nwithout having a sampling frame. In the United States, typically the area code \r\nand the 3-digit exchange are randomly selected from the list of all such codes and \r\nexchanges. Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\nrandomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\nrandomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\nlikely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\nexactly one telephone?)\r\nSources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\nA variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\nthe population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\nof the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\nBesides Gallup, there are other polling \r\ngroups that conduct national surveys, \r\nsuch\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\npeople-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n(www.zogby.com).

The main way \r\nthis occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\nundercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\nthe population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\nprison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\nconsists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\nlandlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\nthose who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\nare in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\nsampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\nNonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\ncannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\nsubjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\nin some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\nissues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\nquestions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\nsuffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\ntelephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\nnonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\nonly about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\ncontact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\nResults have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\nin her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\nfeminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\nStates. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\nleast five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\nquestionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\nlarge. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\nknow whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\nof the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\nadult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\nof using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\nResponse bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\nThis is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\nway, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\nlie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\nthe response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\nIf you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\nquestions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\nlong, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\nRoper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II. In response to \r\nthe question, \u201cDoes it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the \r\nNazi extermination of the Jews never happened?\u201d 22% said it was possible the \r\nHolocaust never happened. The Roper organization later admitted that the ques\ufffetion was worded in a confusing manner. When it asked, \u201cDoes it seem possible \r\nto you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel \r\ncertain that it happened?\u201d only 1% said it was possible it never happened.4\r\nEven the order in which questions are asked can dramatically influence re\ufffesults.

For example, consider \r\nthe population of adults in your \r\nhome town. The results of an opinion \r\nsurvey asking about raising the sales \r\ntax to support public schools may \r\nbe biased in the direction of raising \r\ntaxes if you sample only educators \r\nor biased in the direction of lowering \r\ntaxes if you sample only business \r\nowners. Alternatively, the results \r\ncould be biased toward raising taxes \r\nif a higher proportion of educators \r\nresponded than business owners.\r\n,Q3UDFWLFH Be Alert for \r\nPotential Bias\r\nWith any sample survey, carefully \r\nscrutinize the results.

Two sampling methods that may \r\nbe necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\nConvenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\nbut rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\nrelatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\nmay result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\nof the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\nbe underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\nand 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\ninterviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\nstudy about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\nVolunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\nthe Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\ntype, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\nAs the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\npopulation may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\nhave stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\nsite. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\nCenter (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\nregister their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n(Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\nRepublicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\nof online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\nthan the general population.\r\nConvenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\nboth in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\nstudies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\nto a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\nfind a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\nmedical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\nwherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\nthe new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\nSome samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>","Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\nA poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nThe Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\npresidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\nand Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\nbecause they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\nLiterary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\nplanned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n2.3 million people returned the questionnaire. The Digest predicted that \r\nLandon would win, getting 57% of the vote. Instead, Landon actually got only \r\n36%, and Roosevelt won in a landslide.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na. What was the population?\r\nb. How could the Literary Digest poll make such a large error, especially \r\nwith such a huge sample size? What type of bias occurred in this poll?\r\nThink It Through\r\na. The population was all registered voters in the United States in 1936.\r\nb. This survey had two severe problems:\r\nj Sampling bias due to undercoverage of the sampling frame and a \r\nnonrandom sample: In 1936, the United States was in the Great \r\nDepression. Those who had cars and country club memberships \r\nand thus received questionnaires tended to be wealthy. The wealthy \r\ntended to be primarily Republican, the political party of Landon. \r\nMany potential voters were not on the lists used for the sampling \r\nframe. There was also no guarantee that a subject in the sampling \r\nframe was a registered voter.\r\nj Nonresponse bias: Of the 10 million people who received question\ufffenaires, 7.7 million did not respond. As might be expected, those \r\nindividuals who were unhappy with the incumbent (Roosevelt) were \r\nmore likely to respond.\r\nInsight\r\nFor this same election, a pollster who was getting his new polling agency off the \r\nground surveyed 50,000 people and predicted that Roosevelt would win.

As another example, consider trying to estimate the \r\naverage grade point average (GPA) on your campus. If you select 10 students \r\nfrom the library, you can produce an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs \r\n(assuming those students who go to the library are studying more than those who \r\ndon\u2019t). If you, instead, gather a larger sample of 30 students from the library, you \r\nstill have an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs. The larger sample size \r\ndid not fix the problem of sampling in the library. Many Internet surveys have \r\nthousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\nas a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller.

Some types of nonexperimental \r\nstudies have fewer potential pitfalls than others. For a sample survey with random \r\nsampling, we can make inferences about the population of interest. By contrast, \r\nwith a study using a convenience sample, results apply only to those subjects actu\ufffeally observed. For this reason, some researchers use the term observational study\r\nto refer only to studies that use available subjects (such as a convenience sample) \r\nand not to sample surveys that randomly select their sample.\r\n4.15 Choosing officers A campus club consists of five officers: \r\npresident (P), vice president (V), secretary (S), treasurer \r\n(T), and activity coordinator (A).

First, let\u2019s recall the \r\ndefinition of an experimental study from Section 4.1: We assign each subject to an \r\nexperimental condition, called a treatment. We then observe the outcome on the \r\nresponse variable. The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\nhow the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\nover a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\nIn an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\nname emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\ncould, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\nThe Elements of a Good Experiment\r\nLet\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\nIt is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\nreported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\nSome scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\nan antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\nstudy whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\nFor this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\ncannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\na medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\nwould like to quit.\r\nControl comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\nquit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\ntaking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\nPerhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n You need \r\nto be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\nnot taking the antidepressant.\r\n8\r\nChapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\nover time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>","Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\nAn experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\nan antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\nhelp you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\nshould be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\nother group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\nantidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\nsecond group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\nrelapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\nleast by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\nrate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\nWhy bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\nany active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\nto the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\nare receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\nbetter than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\nis called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\nplacebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\nsubjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\nantidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\ncontrol group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\ncompared to the placebo group.\r\nIn some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\nthan a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\nan antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\nIt may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\npatch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\na placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\nnicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\nRandomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\nsubjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\ntreatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\nthe study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\nsubconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\ngroup that receives the antidepressant.\r\nIt is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\nthe 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\ncontrol group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\nyounger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\nmaking them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\nThis enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\nthey are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\nYou might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\njudgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\nto its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\nage in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\ntreatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\nto be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n(2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\nbalance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\none treatment.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>","200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nYou can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\nthey come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\nan experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\nAn analysis9\r\n of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\nindicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\nin studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\nstudies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\nresults that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n9\r\nSee Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\nSUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\nUse randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\nj To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\nj To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\nj To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\nBlinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\nequally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\nthey are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\nwhether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\nwith the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\nthe subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\ntreatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\ncigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\ndouble-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\nStudy design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nTo investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\nused 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\nor more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\nquit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\ntook 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\nThe other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\nstudy observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\nQuestions to Explore\r\na.

When an experiment \r\nuses a convenience sample, be cautious about the extent to which results gener\ufffealize to a larger population.

This experiment has\r\nResponse variable: Whether the subject abstains from smoking for \r\none year (yes or no)\r\nExplanatory variable: Whether the subject received bupropion (yes \r\nor no)\r\nTreatments: bupropion, no bupropion\r\nExperimental units: The 429 volunteers who are the study subjects\r\nb. The researchers should randomize to assign subjects to the two treat\ufffements. They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\nof the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\nto the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group). The \r\nprocedure would be as follows:\r\nj Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\nj Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\nbupropion group.\r\nj Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\nvalues between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\nwill receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n control group.\r\nc. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\nwhether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\nsources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\nabstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\nInsight\r\nIn the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\nyear, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\nwith 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\nwere not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\nextended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\nalternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\nof observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\nwith humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\nor more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\nSample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\nDesigns\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\nSimple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\nIn practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\nor are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\nSometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\nCluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\nframe\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\ninformation is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\nstudy of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\nstudents can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\nobserving each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\nFor instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\nyour city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\ncity blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\nthen select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\nCluster Random Sample\r\nDivide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\nrandom sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\ncluster random sample.\r\nFor personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\nsampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\nmany observations quickly and with little travel.\r\nSUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\nRandom\u00a0Sample\r\nCluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\nj A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\nj The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\nThe disadvantages are:\r\nj We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\nof precision.\r\nj Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>","Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\nStratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\nnumber of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement. The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\nn = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\njuniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\none of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\nstudent directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\nsampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\nstill having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\nThis type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\nStratified Random Sample\r\nA stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\nbased on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\nrandom sample from each stratum.\r\nStratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\neach subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\nin your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\nstudents who work and who don\u2019t work. However, this information may not be \r\navailable for each student.\r\nSUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Stratified \r\nRandom\u00a0Sample\r\nStratified random sampling has the\r\nj Advantage that you can include in your sample enough subjects in each group \r\n(stratum) you want to evaluate.\r\nj Disadvantage that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into \r\nwhich each subject belongs.\r\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a stratified sample and a cluster sample? A \r\nstratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\namong sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n(cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\nrandom sample).\r\nIn addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\nbased on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\nand can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\nbe defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\nComparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\nensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\ndesign should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\nmethods we\u2019ve presented.\r\nIn practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\nout a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n(1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>","206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\nthem, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\nelection district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\nbe infeasible.\r\nMarketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\nrandomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\nconsumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\nSocial Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\nstratification and clustering.\r\nIn future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\nrandom sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\nsampling. Similar formulas exist for other types of random sampling, but they are \r\ncomplex and beyond the scope of this text.\r\nTable 4.1 Summary of Random Sampling Methods\r\nMethod Description Advantages\r\nSimple random \r\nsample\r\nEach possible sample is equally \r\nlikely\r\nSample tends to be a good \r\nreflection of the population\r\nCluster random \r\nsample\r\nIdentify clusters of subjects, \r\ntake\u00a0simple random sample \r\nof the clusters\r\nDo not need a sampling frame \r\nof subjects, less expensive to \r\nimplement\r\nStratified random \r\nsample\r\nDivide population into groups \r\n(strata), take simple random \r\n sample from each stratum\r\nEnsures enough subjects in each \r\ngroup that you want to compare\r\nm Figure 4.2 Ways of Randomly Sampling 40 Students.

With an observational study, it\u2019s possible that an association \r\nis due to some lurking variable. However, observational studies do have advan\ufffetages. It\u2019s often not practical to conduct an experiment. For instance, with human \r\nsubjects it\u2019s not ethical to design an experiment to study the long-term effect of \r\ncell phone use on getting cancer. Nevertheless, it is possible to design an observa\ufffetional study that controls for identified lurking variables.\r\nRather than taking a cross section of a population at some time, such as with \r\na sample survey, some studies are backward looking (retrospective) or forward \r\nlooking (prospective). Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\nHow can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\nuse and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\nof subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\nand then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups. This approach \r\nwas first applied to study smoking and lung cancer.\r\nRetrospective \r\nstudies b Lung Cancer and Smoking\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nIn 1950 in London, England, medical statisticians Austin Bradford Hill and \r\nRichard Doll conducted one of the first studies linking smoking and lung cancer. \r\nIn 20 hospitals, they matched 709 patients admitted with lung cancer in the pre\ufffeceding year with 709 noncancer patients at the same hospital of the same gender \r\nand within the same five-year grouping on age. All patients were queried about \r\ntheir smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\nleast one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\nto look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\nTable 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\nwere the patients with lung cancer.

The lung \r\ncancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\nInsight\r\nAn inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\nThis suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\nc Try Exercise 4.46\r\nCase-Control Study\r\nA case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\na\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\noutcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\nThis is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\nethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\nsmoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\npotential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\nvariables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\nand hospital.\r\nIn a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\nfixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\nFor instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\ntime to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\nthe explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\nor control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\nsubjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\nhalf the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\nhad lung cancer.\r\n,Q:RUGV\r\nIn Example 8, the response \r\noutcome of interest was having lung \r\ncancer. The cases had lung cancer, \r\nthe controls did not have lung \r\ncancer, and they were compared on \r\nthe explanatory variable\u2014whether \r\nthe subject had been a smoker \r\n(yes\u00a0or no).\r\nCase-control \r\nstudies b Cell Phone Use\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nStudies 1 and 2 about cell phone use in Example 1 were both case-control \r\nstudies. In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\nrandomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\ncases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\neye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\nsubjects with the cases.\r\nQuestion to Explore\r\nWhy might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\nsuch as age?\r\nExample 9 ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>","Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\nProspective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\ninto the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\nThink It Through\r\nWe\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\nsuch as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\nwere observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\nresearchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\nvariables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\nprovides.\r\nWhen researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\nrelationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\nis not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\neffects of lurking variables.\r\nInsight\r\nThe lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\nthe two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\nfinding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\nto be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\nusers of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\nc Try Exercise 4.47\r\nProspective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\nPicture the Scenario\r\nThe Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\nbegan in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years. The purpose of \r\nthe study was to explore relationships among diet, hormonal factors, smok\ufffeing habits, and exercise habits, and the risk of coronary heart disease, pul\ufffemonary disease, and stroke. Since the initial survey in 1976, the nurses have \r\nfilled out a questionnaire every two years.\r\nQuestion to Explore\r\nWhat does it mean for this observational study to be called prospective?\r\nThink It Through\r\nThe retrospective smoking study in Example 8 looked to the past to learn \r\nwhether its lung cancer subjects had been smokers. By contrast, at the start \r\nof the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\nwould eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer.

No, we \r\ncannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\nwas observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\nhave caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\nsmoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\nconducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\ntime, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\nof lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\nretrospective and prospective, have added more evidence. For example, when a \r\nprospective study begun in 1951 with 35,000 doctors ended in 2001, researchers12\r\nestimated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who \r\nnever quit. This study estimated that at least half the people who smoke from \r\nyouth are eventually killed by their habit.\r\nMost important, studies carried out on different populations of people have \r\nconsistently concluded that smoking is associated with lung cancer, even after ad\ufffejusting for all potentially confounding variables that researchers have suggested. \r\nAs more studies are done that adjust for confounding variables, the chance that a \r\nlurking variable remains that can explain the association is reduced.

For in\ufffestance, any difference observed between the drug and the placebo responses is \r\nnot because subjects taking the drug had better overall health. Another example \r\nof a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\nAn additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types. In each field, two \r\nplots are marked, one for each fertilizer. Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\nbe more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\nIf we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\nfertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\napplied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\ncan\u2019t use many fields.\r\nBlocking in an Experiment\r\nThe matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements. The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\nThe crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\nIn experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\nto as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\nwithin blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\nstudy, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\nso they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\nTo reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\nIn the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\nbe randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\neffect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\nthe second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\nassigned to the plots in a field.\r\nculprit.

These are categories of \r\nthe explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\nis then observed for each subject.\r\nj An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\nthat observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\nobserves rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\nSince association does not imply causation, with observational \r\nstudies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\ninfluence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\nrandomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\nto the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\nvariables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\ncausation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\nwith neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\ntreatment a subject was assigned.\r\nA sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\na sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\nincorporate random sampling.\r\nj A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\nin which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\nbeing selected.\r\nj A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\nclusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\nas the sample.\r\nj A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\ngroups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\nfrom each stratum.\r\nBe cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\nsuch as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\nrandom sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\nnonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\nare biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\nMost sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\nwith many experiments. Medical studies often use retrospective\r\nobservational studies, which look at subjects\u2019 behavior in the past.\r\nj A case-control study is an example of a retrospective study. \r\nSubjects who have a response outcome of interest, such as \r\ncancer, serve as cases. Other subjects not having that outcome \r\nserve as controls. The cases and controls are compared on an \r\nexplanatory variable, such as whether they had been smokers.\r\nA categorical explanatory variable in an experiment is also called a \r\nfactor. Multifactor experiments have at least two explanatory vari\ufffeables. With a completely randomized design, subjects are assigned \r\nrandomly to categories of each explanatory variable. Some designs \r\ninstead use blocks\u2014sets of experimental units that are matched. \r\nMatched-pairs designs have two observations in each block. Often \r\nthis is the same subject observed for each of two treatments, such as \r\nin a crossover study.\r\nData are only as good as the method used to obtain them. \r\nUnless we use a good study design, conclusions may be faulty.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 45>","Chapter Problems 217\r\nc.

It states that \u201cresearch \r\nfor the Bar found that over 40 percent of female junior \r\ntenants said they had encountered sexual harassment \r\nduring their time at the Bar.\u201d This was based on a study \r\nconducted at the University of Sheffield that sent a \r\nquestionnaire to 334 junior tenants at the Bar, of whom \r\n159 responded. Of the 159, 67 were female. Of those \r\nfemales, 3 said they had experienced sexual harassment \r\nas a major problem, and 24 had experienced it as a slight \r\nproblem.\r\na. The quoted statement might be misleading because \r\nthe nonresponse was large.\r\nb. No one was forced to respond, so everyone had a \r\nchance to be in the sample, which implies it was a \r\nsimple random sample.\r\nc. This was an example of a completely randomized \r\n experiment, with whether a female junior tenant \r\n experienced sexual harassment as the response \r\nvariable.\r\nd. This was a retrospective case-control study, with those \r\nwho received sexual harassment as the cases.\r\n4.103 Multiple choice: Effect of response categories A study \r\n(N. Schwarz et al., Public Opinion Quarterly, vol. 49, 1985, \r\np. 388) asked German adults how many hours a day they \r\nspend watching TV on a typical day. When the possible \r\nresponses were the six categories (up to 1\r\n2 hour, 1\r\n2 to 1 hour, \r\n1 to 11\r\n2 hours, . . . , more than 21\r\n2 hours), 16% of respondents \r\nsaid they watched more than 21\r\n2 hours per day. When the \r\nsix categories were (up to 21\r\n2 hours, 21\r\n2 to 3 hours, . . . , more \r\nthan 4 hours), 38% said they watched more than 21\r\n2 hours \r\nper day.\r\na. The samples could not have been random, or this \r\nwould not have happened.\r\nb. This shows the importance of question design, especially \r\nwhen people may be uncertain what the answer to the \r\nquestion really is.\r\nc. This study was an experiment, not an observational \r\nstudy.\r\n4.104 Systematic sampling A researcher wants to select 1% of \r\nthe 10,000 subjects from the sampling frame. She selects \r\nsubjects by picking one of the first 100 on the list at ran\ufffedom, skipping 100 names to get the next subject, skipping \r\nanother 100 names to get the next subject, and so on. \r\nThis is called a systematic random sample.\r\na. With simple random sampling, (i) every subject is equally \r\nlikely to be chosen, and (ii) every possible sample of size \r\nn is equally likely. Indicate which, if any, of (i) and (ii) \r\nare true for systematic random samples. Explain.\r\nIn First Sample?\r\nYes (tagged) No (not tagged) Total\r\nIn Second Yes R n\r\nSample? No\r\nTotal M N\r\na. Identify the values of M, n, and R for the biologist\u2019s \r\nexperiment.\r\nb. One way to estimate N lets the sample proportion of \r\ntagged deer equal the population proportion of tagged \r\ndeer. Explain why this means that\r\nR\r\nn = M\r\nN\r\nand, hence, that the estimated population size is \r\nN = 1M * n2 >R\r\nc. Estimate the number of deer in the deer population \r\nusing the numbers given.\r\nd. The U.S. Bureau of the Census uses capture\u2013recapture \r\nto make adjustments to the census by estimating the \r\nundercount. The capture phase is the census itself \r\n(persons are \u201ctagged\u201d by having returned their census \r\nform and being recorded as counted), and the recap\ufffeture phase (the second sample) is the postenumerative \r\nsurvey (PES) conducted after the census. Label the \r\ntable in terms of the census application.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 45 / 45>","Chapter Problems 223\r\nStudent Activities\r\n4.108 Munchie capture\u2013recapture Your class can use the \r\n capture\u2013recapture method described in the previous \r\nexercise to estimate the number of goldfish in a bag \r\nof Cheddar Goldfish. Pour the Cheddar Goldfish into \r\na paper bag, which represents the pond. Sample 10 of \r\nthem. For this initial sample, use Pretzel Goldfish to \r\nreplace them, to represent the tagged fish. Then select a \r\nsecond sample and derive an estimate for N, the number \r\nof Cheddar Goldfish in the original bag. See how close \r\nyour estimate comes to the actual number of fish in the \r\nbag. (Your teacher will count the population of Cheddar \r\nGoldfish in the bag before beginning the sampling.) If the \r\nestimate is not close, what could be responsible, and what \r\nwould this reflect as difficulties in a real-life application \r\nsuch as sampling a wildlife population?\r\n4.109 Activity: Sampling the states This activity illustrates \r\nhow sampling bias can result when you use a nonrandom \r\nsample, even if you attempt to make it representative: \r\nYou are in a geography class, discussing center and \r\nvariability for several characteristics of the states in the \r\ncontiguous United States. A particular value of center is \r\nthe mean area of the states. A map and a list of the states \r\nwith their areas (in square miles) are shown in the figure \r\nand table that follow. Area for a state includes dry land \r\nand permanent inland water surface.\r\nAlthough we could use these data to calculate the actual \r\nmean area, let\u2019s explore how well sampling performs \r\nin estimating the mean area by sampling five states and \r\nfinding the sample mean.\r\na. The most convenient sampling design is to use our \r\neyes to pick five states from the map that we think \r\nhave areas representative of all the states. Do this, \r\npicking five states that you believe have areas rep\uffferesentative of the actual mean area of the states. \r\nCompute their sample mean area.\r\nb. Collect the sample means for all class members. \r\nConstruct a dot plot of these means. Describe the \r\ndistribution of sample means. Note the shape, center, \r\nand variability of the distribution.\r\nc. Another possible sampling design is simple random \r\nsampling. Randomly select five states (using an app \r\nor computer program) and compute the sample \r\nmean area.\r\nd. Collect the sample means from part c of all class \r\nmembers. Construct a dot plot of the sample means \r\nusing the same horizontal scale as in part b. Describe \r\nthis distribution of sample means. Note the shape, \r\ncenter, and variability of the distribution.\r\ne. The true mean total land area for the 48 states can \r\nbe calculated from the accompanying table by divid\ufffeing the total at the bottom of the table by 48. Which \r\nsampling method, using your eyes or using random \r\nselection, tended to be better at estimating the true \r\npopulation mean? Which method seems to be less \r\nbiased? Explain.\r\nf.

We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\n[L3] good observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\n[L4] experiment is not practical.\r\n[L5] Finally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\n[L6] questions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\n[L7] want to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\n[L8] use a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\n[L9] Using Data Already Available\r\n[L10] Of course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\n[L11] question, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\n[L12] instead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\n[L13] your personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\n[L14] phone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\n[L15] Informal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\n[L16] there is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\n[L17] disprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\n[L18] a pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\n[L19] association does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\n[L20] smoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\n[L21] is lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\n[L22] A famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n[L23] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L24] Examples of sources for available data:\r\n[L25] j General Social Survey (GSS)\r\n[L26] j http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\n[L27] j www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\n[L28] j www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\n[L29] j www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\n[L30] Kingdom)\r\n[L31] j www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\n[L32] research studies.

In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\n[L28] gathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\n[L29] determined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\n[L30] observed this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\n[L31] and 2 were observational studies.\r\n[L32] b. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\n[L33] the subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\n[L34] to both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\n[L35] during the second scan.

These are categories of \r\n[L30] the explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\n[L31] is then observed for each subject.\r\n[L32] j An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\n[L33] that observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\n[L34] observes rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\n[L35] Since association does not imply causation, with observational \r\n[L36] studies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\n[L37] influence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\n[L38] randomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\n[L39] to the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\n[L40] variables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\n[L41] causation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\n[L42] with neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\n[L43] treatment a subject was assigned.\r\n[L44] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\n[L45] a sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\n[L46] incorporate random sampling.\r\n[L47] j A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\n[L48] in which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\n[L49] being selected.\r\n[L50] j A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\n[L51] clusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\n[L52] as the sample.\r\n[L53] j A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\n[L54] groups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\n[L55] from each stratum.\r\n[L56] Be cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\n[L57] such as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\n[L58] random sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\n[L59] nonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\n[L60] are biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\n[L61] Most sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\n[L62] with many experiments.\n# \u30103\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"1:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] No experiment was performed.

It reported results from a \r\n[L27] study of 76,000 students in 497 high schools and 225 middle schools nation\ufffewide.1\r\n[L28]  Each student in the study filled out a questionnaire. One question asked \r\n[L29] whether the student used drugs. The study found that drug use was similar \r\n[L30] in schools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. For \r\n[L31] instance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\n[L32] twelfth graders from the two types of schools. In addition, the figure in the \r\n[L33] margin shows the conditional proportions of drug use for these students.\r\n[L34] Questions to Explore\r\n[L35] a.

We\u2019ll now learn about such methods, \r\n[L6] study their pros and cons, and see both good and bad ways to use them. This will \r\n[L7] help us understand when we can trust the conclusions of a study and when we \r\n[L8] need to be skeptical.\r\n[L9] 2. Is the study ethically feasible?\r\n[L10] 3. How can you design the study \r\n[L11] to be efficient?\r\n[L12] 4. What types of biases or lurking \r\n[L13] variables might exist?\r\n[L14] Thinking Ahead\r\n[L15] A knowledge of different study de\ufffesigns for gathering data helps us un\ufffederstand how contradictory results \r\n[L16] can happen in scientific research \r\n[L17] studies and determine which studies \r\n[L18] deserve our trust. In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L19] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L20] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L21] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L22] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L23] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L24] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L25] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L26] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L27] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L28] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L29] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L30] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L31] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L32] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L33] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L34] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L35] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L36] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L37] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L38] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L39] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L40] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L41] 5HFDOO\r\n[L42] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L43] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L44] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L45] we call the sample.\r\n[L46] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L47] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L48] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L49] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L50] variable. b\r\n[L51] Experimental Study\r\n[L52] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L53] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L54] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L55] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L56] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects.

Cell \r\n[L41] phones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\n[L42] main source of this energy. The closer \r\n[L43] the antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\n[L44] greater the exposure to radiation. \r\n[L45] With the increased use of cell phones, \r\n[L46] there has been a growing concern \r\n[L47] over the potential health risks. Several \r\n[L48] studies have explored the possibility \r\n[L49] of such risks:\r\n[L50] Study 1 A German study (Stang \r\n[L51] et\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\n[L52] with a rare form of eye cancer called \r\n[L53] uveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n[L54]  patients who did not have this eye \r\n[L55] cancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\n[L56] was measured using a questionnaire. \r\n[L57] On average, the eye cancer patients \r\n[L58] used cell phones more often.\r\n[L59] Study 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\n[L60] et al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\n[L61] with brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\n[L62] without brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\n[L63] cell phone use was measured using a \r\n[L64] questionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\n[L65] two groups was similar.\r\n[L66] Study 3 A study published in The \r\n[L67] Journal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\n[L68] that cell phone use speeds up activity \r\n[L69] in the brain. As part of a randomized \r\n[L70] crossover study, 47 participants were \r\n[L71] fitted with a cell phone device on each \r\n[L72] ear and then underwent two positron \r\n[L73] emission topography, or PET, scans \r\n[L74] to measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\n[L75] During one scan, the cell phones were \r\n[L76] both turned off. During the other \r\n[L77] scan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\n[L78] call was made to the phone on the \r\n[L79] right ear. The order of when the call \r\n[L80] was received (for the first or second \r\n[L81] scan) was randomized. Comparison \r\n[L82] of the PET scans showed a significant \r\n[L83] increase in activity in the part of the \r\n[L84] brain closest to the antenna during \r\n[L85] the transmission of the automated \r\n[L86] call.\r\n[L87] Studies 1 and 3 found potential \r\n[L88] physiological responses to cell \r\n[L89] phone use.

Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L3] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L4] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L5] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L6] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L7] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L8] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L9] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L10] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L11] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L12] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L13] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L14] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L15] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L16] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L17] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L18] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L19] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L20] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L21] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L22] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L23] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L24] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L25] than the general population.\r\n[L26] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L27] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L28] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L29] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L30] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L31] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L32] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L33] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L34] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L35] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L36] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L37] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L38] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L39] and Alf Landon (Republican).

In 1936, \r\n[L41] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L42] planned to vote.

But some studies mistakenly try to generalize \r\n[L41] to a broader population than the one from which the sample was taken. A psy\ufffechologist may conduct an experiment using a sample of students from an intro\ufffeductory psychology course. For the results to be of wider interest, however, the \r\n[L42] psychologist might claim that the conclusions generalize to all college students, \r\n[L43] to all young adults, or even to all adults. Such generalizations may be wrong since \r\n[L44] the sample may differ from those populations in fundamental ways such as in \r\n[L45] average socioeconomic status, race, or gender, or attitudes.\r\n[L46] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Good Experiment\r\n[L47] j A good experiment has a control comparison group, randomization in assigning \r\n[L48] experimental units to treatments, and blinding.\r\n[L49] j The experimental units are the subjects\u2014the people, animals, or other objects to \r\n[L50] which the treatments are applied.\r\n[L51] j The treatments are the experimental conditions imposed on the experimental \r\n[L52] units.

The response variable \r\n[L3] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L4] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L5] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L6] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L7] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L8] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L9] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L10] 5HFDOO\r\n[L11] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L12] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L13] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L14] we call the sample.\r\n[L15] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L16] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L17] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L18] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L19] variable. b\r\n[L20] Experimental Study\r\n[L21] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L22] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L23] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L24] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L25] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L26] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L27] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\n[L28] the experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\n[L29] response variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\n[L30] it increased.\r\n[L31] An experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\n[L32] in the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\n[L33] By contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\n[L34] and the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\n[L35] them. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\n[L36] Observational Study\r\n[L37] In an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\n[L38] explanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\n[L39] In short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\n[L40] the study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\n[L41] treatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\n[L42] Identifying experimental \r\n[L43] versus observational \r\n[L44] studies\r\n[L45] b\r\n[L46] Cell Phone Use\r\n[L47] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L48] Example 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\n[L49] between cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body.

In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\n[L58] gathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\n[L59] determined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\n[L60] observed this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\n[L61] and 2 were observational studies.\n# \u30104\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"1:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L2] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L3] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L4] random sample).\r\n[L5] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L6] based on a subject characteristic.

The \r\n[L11] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L12] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L13] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L14] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L15] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L16] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L17] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L18] be infeasible.\r\n[L19] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L20] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L21] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L22] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L23] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L24] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L25] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L26] sampling. Similar formulas exist for other types of random sampling, but they are \r\n[L27] complex and beyond the scope of this text.\r\n[L28] Table 4.1 Summary of Random Sampling Methods\r\n[L29] Method Description Advantages\r\n[L30] Simple random \r\n[L31] sample\r\n[L32] Each possible sample is equally \r\n[L33] likely\r\n[L34] Sample tends to be a good \r\n[L35] reflection of the population\r\n[L36] Cluster random \r\n[L37] sample\r\n[L38] Identify clusters of subjects, \r\n[L39] take\u00a0simple random sample \r\n[L40] of the clusters\r\n[L41] Do not need a sampling frame \r\n[L42] of subjects, less expensive to \r\n[L43] implement\r\n[L44] Stratified random \r\n[L45] sample\r\n[L46] Divide population into groups \r\n[L47] (strata), take simple random \r\n[L48]  sample from each stratum\r\n[L49] Ensures enough subjects in each \r\n[L50] group that you want to compare\r\n[L51] m Figure 4.2 Ways of Randomly Sampling 40 Students.

Studies 183\r\n[L2] As we will soon discuss, an experimental study gives the researcher more control \r\n[L3] over outside influences. This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\n[L4] association.\r\n[L5] Advantage of Experiments Over \r\n[L6] Observational\u00a0Studies\r\n[L7] In an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\n[L8] Example 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\n[L9] there could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\n[L10] cancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\n[L11] who do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\n[L12] a possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\n[L13] phones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\n[L14] screens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\n[L15] eye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\n[L16] By contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\n[L17] the results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\n[L18] which subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\n[L19] groups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\n[L20] similar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\n[L21] to have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\n[L22] condition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\n[L23] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L24] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L25] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L26] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L27] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L28] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L29] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L30] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L31] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L32] differences, on the average.\r\n[L33] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L34] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L35] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L36] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L37] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L38] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L39] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L40] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L41] imply causation.\r\n[L42] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L43] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L44] with an observational study.\n# \u30101\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file1\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:1\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Question to Explore\r\n[L2] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L3] such as age?\r\n[L4] Example 9 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\n[L5] Prospective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\n[L6] into the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\n[L7] Think It Through\r\n[L8] We\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\n[L9] such as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\n[L10] were observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\n[L11] researchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\n[L12] variables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\n[L13] provides.\r\n[L14] When researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\n[L15] relationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\n[L16] is not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\n[L17] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L18] Insight\r\n[L19] The lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\n[L20] the two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\n[L21] finding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\n[L22] to be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\n[L23] users of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\n[L24] c Try Exercise 4.47\r\n[L25] Prospective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\n[L26] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L27] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\n[L28] began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years. The purpose of \r\n[L29] the study was to explore relationships among diet, hormonal factors, smok\ufffeing habits, and exercise habits, and the risk of coronary heart disease, pul\ufffemonary disease, and stroke. Since the initial survey in 1976, the nurses have \r\n[L30] filled out a questionnaire every two years.\r\n[L31] Question to Explore\r\n[L32] What does it mean for this observational study to be called prospective?\r\n[L33] Think It Through\r\n[L34] The retrospective smoking study in Example 8 looked to the past to learn \r\n[L35] whether its lung cancer subjects had been smokers. By contrast, at the start \r\n[L36] of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\n[L37] would eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer. The study followed \r\n[L38] each nurse into the future to see whether she developed that outcome and \r\n[L39] to analyze whether certain explanatory variables (such as smoking) were \r\n[L40] associated with it.\r\n[L41] Example 10 \r\n[L42] 11More information on this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00005152 and at \r\n[L43] www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs.<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 45><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 45>210 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L44] Observational Studies and Causation\r\n[L45] Can we ever definitively establish causation with an observational study? No, we \r\n[L46] cannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\n[L47] was observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\n[L48] have caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\n[L49] smoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\n[L50] conducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\n[L51] time, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\n[L52] of lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\n[L53] retrospective and prospective, have added more evidence.\n# \u30102\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L2] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L3] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L4] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L5] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L6] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L7] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L8] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L9] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L10] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L11] one treatment.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L12] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L13] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L14] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L15] An analysis9\r\n[L16]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L17] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L18] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L19] studies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L20] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L21] 9\r\n[L22] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L23] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L24] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L25] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L26] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L27] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L28] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L29] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L30] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L31] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L32] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L33] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L34] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L35] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L36] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L37] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L38] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L39] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L40] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L41] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L42] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L43] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L44] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L45] The other group did not take an antidepressant.\n# \u30103\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] The health of \r\n[L2] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L3] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L4] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L5] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L6] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L7] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L8] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L9] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L10] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L11] differences, on the average.\r\n[L12] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L13] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L14] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L15] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L16] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L17] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L18] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L19] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L20] imply causation.\r\n[L21] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L22] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L23] with an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\n[L24] which treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\n[L25] explanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\n[L26] discovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\n[L27] conduct an experiment.\r\n[L28] 5HFDOO\r\n[L29] From Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\n[L30] a variable not observed in the study that \r\n[L31] influences the association between the \r\n[L32] response and explanatory variables due \r\n[L33] to its own association with each of those \r\n[L34] variables. b\r\n[L35] &DXWLRQ\r\n[L36] In Example 3, the problem with the \r\n[L37] conclusion they made is that schools with \r\n[L38] high rates of drug use might be more \r\n[L39] inclined to employ drug tests to address \r\n[L40] the problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\n[L41] tests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n[L42] 0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\n[L43] also conceivable that drug use rates started \r\n[L44] at 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\n[L45] the drug test program. The problem with \r\n[L46] this observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\n[L47] know which of the previous conceivable \r\n[L48] scenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\n[L49] occurred. b<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L50] Determining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\n[L51] If experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\n[L52] bother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\n[L53] than for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\n[L54] the following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\n[L55] use a cell phone each day for the next 50 years.\n# \u30104\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] It reported results from a \r\n[L2] study of 76,000 students in 497 high schools and 225 middle schools nation\ufffewide.1\r\n[L3]  Each student in the study filled out a questionnaire. One question asked \r\n[L4] whether the student used drugs. The study found that drug use was similar \r\n[L5] in schools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. For \r\n[L6] instance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\n[L7] twelfth graders from the two types of schools. In addition, the figure in the \r\n[L8] margin shows the conditional proportions of drug use for these students.\r\n[L9] Questions to Explore\r\n[L10] a. What were the response and explanatory variables?\r\n[L11] b. Was this an observational study or an experiment?\r\n[L12] Example 3 \r\n[L13] Drug Use\r\n[L14] Drug Tests?

The study compared the percentage of students who used drugs in \r\n[L19] schools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. \r\n[L20] Whether the student used drugs was the response variable. The ex\ufffeplanatory variable was whether the student\u2019s school tested for drugs. \r\n[L21] Both variables were categorical, with categories \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d \r\n[L22] For each grade, the data were summarized in a contingency table, as \r\n[L23] shown in the margin for twelfth graders.\r\n[L24] b. For each student, the study merely observed whether his or her school \r\n[L25] tested for drugs and whether he or she used drugs. So this was an ob\ufffeservational study.\r\n[L26] Insight\r\n[L27] An experiment would have assigned schools to use or not use drug testing \r\n[L28] rather than leaving the decision to the schools. For instance, the study could \r\n[L29] have randomly selected half the schools to perform drug testing and half not to \r\n[L30] perform it and then, a year later, measured the student drug use in each school.\r\n[L31] c Try Exercise 4.7<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 45><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 45>Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 183\r\n[L32] As we will soon discuss, an experimental study gives the researcher more control \r\n[L33] over outside influences. This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\n[L34] association.\r\n[L35] Advantage of Experiments Over \r\n[L36] Observational\u00a0Studies\r\n[L37] In an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\n[L38] Example 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\n[L39] there could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\n[L40] cancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\n[L41] who do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\n[L42] a possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\n[L43] phones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\n[L44] screens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\n[L45] eye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\n[L46] By contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\n[L47] the results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\n[L48] which subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\n[L49] groups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\n[L50] similar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\n[L51] to have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\n[L52] condition instead of having each subject receive both treatments.\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://568e66fa8c8c602#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":70436,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://9817beec834ef81#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":69393,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null}],"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":2,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["files_uploaded_in_conversation","recording_knowledge"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"d8649e6c-44cd-4671-bfbf-443c45477ed0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"0c24fd7e-6e9e-4a89-b0be-fb557e649d49","turn_exchange_id":"e859628d-148a-49be-8cd2-671bbc5ebb8f"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0c24fd7e-6e9e-4a89-b0be-fb557e649d49","children":["af8ccd9f-efa0-44f0-a3f4-79129ef13655"]},"67142eab-2b12-4066-a905-169018de0e7b":{"id":"67142eab-2b12-4066-a905-169018de0e7b","message":{"id":"67142eab-2b12-4066-a905-169018de0e7b","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1766204002.4803746,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"spinner","status":"running","retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"28dcd739-6aae-4199-b9c7-43d297012094","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"621d2d2d-4d37-426e-bd36-69f2b5009f33","turn_exchange_id":"f3795600-3b5d-43a6-9e88-5015a9f1e6ff"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"621d2d2d-4d37-426e-bd36-69f2b5009f33","children":["ef065320-6331-4d97-9c8d-a2c2c87bbf8e"]},"af8ccd9f-efa0-44f0-a3f4-79129ef13655":{"id":"af8ccd9f-efa0-44f0-a3f4-79129ef13655","message":{"id":"af8ccd9f-efa0-44f0-a3f4-79129ef13655","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766203536.820628,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Expanding search for ethics and feasibility of studies","content":"I need more information about ethical feasibility, efficiency, and bias from the intro and section 4.1.

It gathers in\ufffeformation by interviewing a sample of subjects from the U.S. adult population to \r\n[L18] provide a snapshot of that population. The study in Example 3 on student drug \r\n[L19] use in schools also used a sample survey.\r\n[L20] 2\r\n[L21] Most surveys of research about cell phones suggest that there is no convincing evidence yet of adverse \r\n[L22] radiation effects (e.g., D. R. Cox, J. Roy. Statist. Soc., Ser. A, vol. 166, pp. 241\u2013246, 2003). The primary \r\n[L23] danger appears to be people using cell phones while driving!\r\n[L24] Sample Survey\r\n[L25] A sample survey selects a sample of subjects from a population and collects data from \r\n[L26] them. In the field of statistics a survey does not just indicate an opinion poll or a question\ufffenaire; it includes any information gathered from or about the subject.\r\n[L27] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study. The subjects provide data \r\n[L28] on the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\n[L29] Most countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\n[L30] number of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\n[L31] them. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\n[L32] entire population.\r\n[L33] In Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\n[L34] of the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n[L35] 1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\n[L36] more than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\n[L37] the population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\n[L38] j The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\n[L39] census. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\n[L40] seats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\n[L41] on how their population size compares with other states.\r\n[L42] j Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\n[L43] j Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\n[L44] and local communities.\r\n[L45] Although it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\n[L46] practice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\n[L47] census bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient.\n# \u30103\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L2] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L3] Sampling Frame\r\n[L4] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L5] taken.\r\n[L6] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L7] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L8] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L9] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L10] of registered students.\r\n[L11] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L12] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L13] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L14] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L15] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L16] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L17] doubtful.\r\n[L18] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L19] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L20] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L21] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L22] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L23] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L24] be misleading.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L25] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L26] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L27] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L28] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L29] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L30] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L31] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L32] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L33] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L34] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L35] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L36] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L37] 5HFDOO\r\n[L38] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L39] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L40] called the sample size. b\r\n[L41] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L42] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L43] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L44] Simple random \r\n[L45] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L46] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L47] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L48] a dinner banquet and raffle. The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\n[L49] of football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\n[L50] everyone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once.\n# \u30104\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\n[L2] prison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\n[L3] consists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\n[L4] landlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\n[L5] those who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\n[L6] are in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\n[L7] sampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\n[L8] Nonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\n[L9] cannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\n[L10] subjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\n[L11] in some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\n[L12] issues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\n[L13] questions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\n[L14] suffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\n[L15] telephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\n[L16] nonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\n[L17] only about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\n[L18] contact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\n[L19] Results have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\n[L20] in her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\n[L21] feminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\n[L22] States. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\n[L23] least five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\n[L24] questionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\n[L25] large. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\n[L26] know whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\n[L27] of the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\n[L28] adult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\n[L29] of using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\n[L30] Response bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\n[L31] This is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\n[L32] way, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\n[L33] lie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\n[L34] the response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\n[L35] If you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\n[L36] questions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\n[L37] long, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\n[L38] Roper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II. In response to \r\n[L39] the question, \u201cDoes it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the \r\n[L40] Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?\u201d 22% said it was possible the \r\n[L41] Holocaust never happened. The Roper organization later admitted that the ques\ufffetion was worded in a confusing manner. When it asked, \u201cDoes it seem possible \r\n[L42] to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel \r\n[L43] certain that it happened?\u201d only 1% said it was possible it never happened.4\r\n[L44] Even the order in which questions are asked can dramatically influence re\ufffesults.\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://568e66fa8c8c602#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":70436,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null}],"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":2,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["slurm_github_commits","slurm_github_issues","slurm_github_pulls","recording_knowledge","files_uploaded_in_conversation","slurm_github"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"28dcd739-6aae-4199-b9c7-43d297012094","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"67142eab-2b12-4066-a905-169018de0e7b","turn_exchange_id":"f3795600-3b5d-43a6-9e88-5015a9f1e6ff"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"67142eab-2b12-4066-a905-169018de0e7b","children":["745c1277-f184-49ec-956f-3632abaaad73"]},"81961330-27d9-4883-8da1-fb51fd2a97b2":{"id":"81961330-27d9-4883-8da1-fb51fd2a97b2","message":{"id":"81961330-27d9-4883-8da1-fb51fd2a97b2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766203528.225587,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"pointers\":[\"2:3\"]}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"d8649e6c-44cd-4671-bfbf-443c45477ed0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"af8ccd9f-efa0-44f0-a3f4-79129ef13655","turn_exchange_id":"e859628d-148a-49be-8cd2-671bbc5ebb8f"},"recipient":"file_search.mclick","channel":null},"parent":"af8ccd9f-efa0-44f0-a3f4-79129ef13655","children":["73855869-d504-4be5-93bc-ac494ed4d460"]},"745c1277-f184-49ec-956f-3632abaaad73":{"id":"745c1277-f184-49ec-956f-3632abaaad73","message":{"id":"745c1277-f184-49ec-956f-3632abaaad73","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766204010.250522,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for Section 4.3 details on study concepts","content":"I\u2019ve got the advantage of experiments, anecdotal evidence, and sampling definitions, but I still need more for Section 4.3.

Cell \r\n[L42] phones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\n[L43] main source of this energy. The closer \r\n[L44] the antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\n[L45] greater the exposure to radiation. \r\n[L46] With the increased use of cell phones, \r\n[L47] there has been a growing concern \r\n[L48] over the potential health risks. Several \r\n[L49] studies have explored the possibility \r\n[L50] of such risks:\r\n[L51] Study 1 A German study (Stang \r\n[L52] et\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\n[L53] with a rare form of eye cancer called \r\n[L54] uveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n[L55]  patients who did not have this eye \r\n[L56] cancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\n[L57] was measured using a questionnaire. \r\n[L58] On average, the eye cancer patients \r\n[L59] used cell phones more often.\r\n[L60] Study 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\n[L61] et al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\n[L62] with brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\n[L63] without brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\n[L64] cell phone use was measured using a \r\n[L65] questionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\n[L66] two groups was similar.\r\n[L67] Study 3 A study published in The \r\n[L68] Journal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\n[L69] that cell phone use speeds up activity \r\n[L70] in the brain. As part of a randomized \r\n[L71] crossover study, 47 participants were \r\n[L72] fitted with a cell phone device on each \r\n[L73] ear and then underwent two positron \r\n[L74] emission topography, or PET, scans \r\n[L75] to measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\n[L76] During one scan, the cell phones were \r\n[L77] both turned off. During the other \r\n[L78] scan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\n[L79] call was made to the phone on the \r\n[L80] right ear. The order of when the call \r\n[L81] was received (for the first or second \r\n[L82] scan) was randomized.

In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L124] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L125] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L126] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L127] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L128] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L129] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L130] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L131] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L132] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L133] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L134] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L135] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L136] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L137] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L138] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L139] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L140] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L141] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L142] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L143] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L144] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L145] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L146] 5HFDOO\r\n[L147] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L148] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L149] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L150] we call the sample.\r\n[L151] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L152] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L153] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L154] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L155] variable. b\r\n[L156] Experimental Study\r\n[L157] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L158] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L159] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L160] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L161] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L162] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories ","[L163] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>","[L164] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L165] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\n[L166] the experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\n[L167] response variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\n[L168] it increased.\r\n[L169] An experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\n[L170] in the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\n[L171] By contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\n[L172] and the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\n[L173] them. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\n[L174] Observational Study\r\n[L175] In an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\n[L176] explanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\n[L177] In short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\n[L178] the study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\n[L179] treatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\n[L180] Identifying experimental \r\n[L181] versus observational \r\n[L182] studies\r\n[L183] b\r\n[L184] Cell Phone Use\r\n[L185] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L186] Example 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\n[L187] between cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body. We\u2019ve \r\n[L188] seen that Study 3 was an experiment. Studies 1 and 2 both examined the \r\n[L189] amount of cell phone use for cancer patients and for noncancer patients us\ufffeing a questionnaire.\r\n[L190] Questions to Explore\r\n[L191] a. Were Studies 1 and 2 experimental or observational studies?\r\n[L192] b. How were Studies 1 and 2 fundamentally different from Study 3 in \r\n[L193] terms of how the treatments were determined for each subject?\r\n[L194] Think It Through\r\n[L195] a. In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\n[L196] gathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\n[L197] determined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\n[L198] observed this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\n[L199] and 2 were observational studies.\r\n[L200] b. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\n[L201] the subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\n[L202] to both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\n[L203] during the second scan. The researchers imposed the treatments on \r\n[L204] the subjects. So, Study 3 was an experimental study.*\r\n[L205] Example 2 \r\n[L206] *The researchers noted that \u201cResults of this study provide evidence that acute cell phone expo\ufffesure affects brain metabolic activity.

For \r\n[L230] instance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\n[L231] twelfth graders from the two types of schools. In addition, the figure in the \r\n[L232] margin shows the conditional proportions of drug use for these students.\r\n[L233] Questions to Explore\r\n[L234] a.

For instance, the study could \r\n[L253] have randomly selected half the schools to perform drug testing and half not to \r\n[L254] perform it and then, a year later, measured the student drug use in each school.\r\n[L255] c Try Exercise 4.7","[L256] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://568e66fa8c8c602#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":70436,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L257] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 45>","[L258] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 183\r\n[L259] As we will soon discuss, an experimental study gives the researcher more control \r\n[L260] over outside influences. This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\n[L261] association.\r\n[L262] Advantage of Experiments Over \r\n[L263] Observational\u00a0Studies\r\n[L264] In an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\n[L265] Example 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\n[L266] there could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\n[L267] cancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\n[L268] who do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\n[L269] a possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\n[L270] phones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\n[L271] screens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\n[L272] eye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\n[L273] By contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\n[L274] the results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\n[L275] which subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\n[L276] groups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\n[L277] similar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\n[L278] to have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\n[L279] condition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\n[L280] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L281] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L282] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L283] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L284] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L285] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L286] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L287] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L288] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L289] differences, on the average.\r\n[L290] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L291] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L292] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L293] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L294] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L295] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L296] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L297] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L298] imply causation.\r\n[L299] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L300] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L301] with an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\n[L302] which treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\n[L303] explanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\n[L304] discovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\n[L305] conduct an experiment.\r\n[L306] 5HFDOO\r\n[L307] From Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\n[L308] a variable not observed in the study that \r\n[L309] influences the association between the \r\n[L310] response and explanatory variables due \r\n[L311] to its own association with each of those \r\n[L312] variables. b\r\n[L313] &DXWLRQ\r\n[L314] In Example 3, the problem with the \r\n[L315] conclusion they made is that schools with \r\n[L316] high rates of drug use might be more \r\n[L317] inclined to employ drug tests to address \r\n[L318] the problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\n[L319] tests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n[L320] 0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\n[L321] also conceivable that drug use rates started \r\n[L322] at 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\n[L323] the drug test program. The problem with \r\n[L324] this observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\n[L325] know which of the previous conceivable \r\n[L326] scenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\n[L327] occurred. b","[L328] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>","[L329] 184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L330] Determining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\n[L331] If experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\n[L332] bother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\n[L333] than for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\n[L334] the following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\n[L335] use a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\n[L336] body never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\n[L337] more common for those who used cell phones.\r\n[L338] There are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\n[L339] j It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\n[L340] subjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\n[L341] harmful.\r\n[L342] j It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told. How can \r\n[L343] you monitor them to ensure that they adhere to their treatment assignment \r\n[L344] over the 50-year experimental period?\r\n[L345] j Who wants to wait 50 years to get an answer?\r\n[L346] For these reasons, medical experiments are often performed over a short time \r\n[L347] period or often with exposure to treatments that would not be out of the ordinary \r\n[L348] (such as a one-time exposure to cell phone activity). To measure the effects on \r\n[L349] people of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\n[L350] uses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\n[L351] populations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\n[L352] when we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\n[L353] studies. Then we are not deliberately placing people in harm\u2019s way, but observing \r\n[L354] people who have chosen on their own to take part in the activity of interest. In \r\n[L355] today\u2019s information age, a lot of data is readily available to assist (or impede) \r\n[L356] people from making decisions about the relationship between variables. These \r\n[L357] data provide only observational comparisons. We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\n[L358] good observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\n[L359] experiment is not practical.\r\n[L360] Finally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\n[L361] questions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\n[L362] want to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\n[L363] use a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\n[L364] Using Data Already Available\r\n[L365] Of course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\n[L366] question, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\n[L367] instead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\n[L368] your personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\n[L369] phone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\n[L370] Informal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\n[L371] there is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\n[L372] disprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\n[L373] a pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\n[L374] association does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\n[L375] smoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\n[L376] is lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\n[L377] A famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n[L378] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L379] Examples of sources for available data:\r\n[L380] j General Social Survey (GSS)\r\n[L381] j http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\n[L382] j www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\n[L383] j www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\n[L384] j www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\n[L385] Kingdom)\r\n[L386] j www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)","[L387] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>","[L388] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\n[L389] research studies.

The subjects provide data \r\n[L406] on the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\n[L407] Most countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\n[L408] number of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\n[L409] them. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\n[L410] entire population.\r\n[L411] In Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\n[L412] of the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n[L413] 1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\n[L414] more than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\n[L415] the population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\n[L416] j The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\n[L417] census. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\n[L418] seats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\n[L419] on how their population size compares with other states.\r\n[L420] j Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\n[L421] j Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\n[L422] and local communities.\r\n[L423] Although it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\n[L424] practice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\n[L425] census bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient. \r\n[L426] Because data are needed regularly on economic variables, such as the unem\ufffeployment rate, the U.S. Bureau of the Census continually takes samples of the \r\n[L427] population rather than relying solely on the complete census. An example is the \r\n[L428] monthly Current Population Survey, which surveys about 50,000 U.S. house\ufffeholds and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the \r\n[L429] United States, including the unemployment rate. It is usually more practical, in \r\n[L430] terms of time and money, to take a sample rather than to try to measure every\ufffeone in a population.","[L431] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 45>","[L432] 186 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L433] For a sample survey to be informative, it is important for the sample to reflect \r\n[L434] the population well.

A nationwide census is conducted \r\n[L616] in the United States every 10 years.\r\n[L617] a. Give at least two reasons the United States takes a census \r\n[L618] only every 10 years.\r\n[L619] 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\r\n[L620] The sample survey is a common type of nonexperimental study. The first step of \r\n[L621] a sample survey is to define the population targeted by the study. For instance, \r\n[L622] the Gallup organization (www.gallup.com) conducts a monthly survey of about \r\n[L623] 1000 adult Americans. Gallup then reports the percentage of those sampled who \r\n[L624] respond \u201capprove\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way [the \r\n[L625] current president of the United States] is handling his job as president?\u201d If the \r\n[L626] sampling is conducted properly, this provides a good estimate of the approval \r\n[L627] rate within the entire population. The population consists of all adults living in \r\n[L628] the United States.\r\n[L629] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L630] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L631] Sampling Frame\r\n[L632] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L633] taken.\r\n[L634] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L635] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L636] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L637] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L638] of registered students.\r\n[L639] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L640] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L641] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L642] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L643] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L644] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L645] doubtful.\r\n[L646] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L647] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L648] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L649] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L650] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L651] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L652] be misleading.","[L653] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>","[L654] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L655] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L656] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L657] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L658] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L659] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L660] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L661] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L662] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L663] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L664] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L665] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L666] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L667] 5HFDOO\r\n[L668] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L669] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L670] called the sample size. b\r\n[L671] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L672] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L673] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L674] Simple random \r\n[L675] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L676] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L677] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L678] a dinner banquet and raffle. The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\n[L679] of football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\n[L680] everyone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once. (This is \r\n[L681] called sampling without replacement.) To select the two winners, the organiz\ufffeers choose a simple random sample of size n = 2 from the 60 ticket holders. \r\n[L682] Each individual at the banquet receives an entry with a number between 1 and \r\n[L683] 60. Duplicate tickets numbered 1 to 60 are placed in a container and mixed, \r\n[L684] after which the two winning entries are chosen at random. Whoever holds the \r\n[L685] tickets containing the same numbers as those drawn at random wins the foot\ufffeball tickets.\r\n[L686] Questions to Explore\r\n[L687] a. What are the possible samples?\r\n[L688] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 will be drawn?\r\n[L689] c. Professor Shaffer is in attendance at the banquet and holds entry num\ufffeber 1. What is the chance that her entry will be chosen? Mr. Chatterjee \r\n[L690] holds entry number 55. What is the chance that his entry will be chosen?\r\n[L691] Think It Through\r\n[L692] a. The entire collection of possible samples is too long to list, but we can \r\n[L693] visualize the possibilities by listing certain pairs:\r\n[L694] (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), . . . , (1,58), (1,59), (1,60)\r\n[L695] (2,3), (2,4), . . . , (2,58), (2,59), (2,60)\r\n[L696] .\r\n[L697] .\r\n[L698] .\r\n[L699] Example 4 ","[L700] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>","[L701] 190 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L702] Selecting a Simple Random Sample\r\n[L703] What\u2019s a better way to take a simple random sample than blindly drawing slips \r\n[L704] of paper out of a hat? You first number the subjects in the sampling frame. You \r\n[L705] then generate a set of those numbers randomly. Finally, you sample the subjects \r\n[L706] whose numbers were generated. One method of generating numbers randomly \r\n[L707] is to use a random number table. In practice, technology is used to generate the \r\n[L708] sample. This could be an app or a statistical program. The following example \r\n[L709] demonstrates how a random sample is generated in MINITAB (left column).\r\n[L710] Taking a Random Sample Consider taking a random sample of three students \r\n[L711] from a class in which the following students are enrolled: Aisha, Benedict, Chung, \r\n[L712] Diego, Emily, Francisco, Girish, Hank, Isabella, and Jing.\r\n[L713] It can be done in MINITAB, as shown below.\r\n[L714] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L715] The Random Numbers web app from \r\n[L716] the book\u2019s website can also be used to \r\n[L717] generate random numbers. The screenshot \r\n[L718] in the margin next to Example 5 on the next \r\n[L719] page illustrates. b\r\n[L720] (57,58), (57,59), (57,60)\r\n[L721] (58,59), (58,60)\r\n[L722] (59,60)\r\n[L723] b. The first row above contains 59 possible samples, the second row con\ufffetains 58, and so forth. There are thus 59 + 58 + c + 2 + 1, which \r\n[L724] equals 1770 possible samples. The process of randomly selecting two \r\n[L725] unique entries ensures that each possible sample of size 2 has an equal \r\n[L726] chance of occurring. Since there are 1770 possible samples, the chance \r\n[L727] of any one sample being selected is 1 out of 1770.\r\n[L728] c. Looking at the top row in part a, we see that 1 shows up in 59 of the \r\n[L729] samples (all of the samples listed in the top row).

There are better \r\n[L736] ways of selecting simple random samples, as we\u2019ll learn next.\r\n[L737] c Try Exercise 4.16","[L738] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://2a1ab342a4235ad#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60206,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L739] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 45>","[L740] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 191\r\n[L741] When we executed this command in MINITAB, the following random sample \r\n[L742] was obtained. This would be your sample of size 3.\r\n[L743] Note that if you select a random sample, you will not necessarily get the same \r\n[L744] three people.\r\n[L745] Selecting a Simple \r\n[L746] Random Sample b Auditing a School District\r\n[L747] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L748] Local school districts must be prepared for annual visits from state auditors \r\n[L749] whose job is to verify the dollar amount of the accounts within the school \r\n[L750] district and determine whether the money is being spent appropriately. It \r\n[L751] is too time-consuming and expensive for auditors to review all accounts, \r\n[L752] so they typically review only some of them. So that a school district cannot \r\n[L753] anticipate which accounts will be reviewed, the auditors often take a simple \r\n[L754] random sample of the accounts.\r\n[L755] Questions to Explore\r\n[L756] a. How can the auditors use random numbers to select 10 accounts to \r\n[L757] audit in a school district that has 60 accounts?\r\n[L758] b. Why is it important for the auditors not to use personal judgment in \r\n[L759] selecting the accounts to audit?\r\n[L760] Think It Through\r\n[L761] a. The sampling frame consists of the 60 accounts. We first number the \r\n[L762] accounts 1 through 60. Alternatively, they could list the names of the \r\n[L763] accounts. The accounts MINITAB selected (see below for details of \r\n[L764] the process) were 56, 43, 35, 47, 15, 8, 31, 9, 33, and 36. We cannot \r\n[L765] verify that these numbers are randomly selected, but we know that the \r\n[L766] process used to generate them employs random selection.\r\n[L767] b. By using simple random sampling, the auditors hold the school district \r\n[L768] responsible for all accounts. If the auditors personally chose the ac\ufffecounts to audit, they might select certain accounts each year. A school \r\n[L769] district would soon learn which accounts they need to have in order \r\n[L770] and which accounts can be given less attention.\r\n[L771] Insight\r\n[L772] Likewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) randomly selects some tax re\ufffeturns for audit, so taxpayers cannot predict ahead of time whether they will \r\n[L773] be audited. For efficiency, the IRS samples a small proportion of tax returns \r\n[L774] with small amounts owed and a larger proportion of tax returns with high \r\n[L775] amounts owed. It does this because it cares about the total amount of tax \r\n[L776] revenue brought in.\r\n[L777] c Try Exercise 4.17\r\n[L778] Example 5 \r\n[L779] Methods of Collecting Data in Sample Surveys\r\n[L780] In Example 5, the subjects sampled were accounts. More commonly, they are \r\n[L781] people. For any survey, it is difficult to get a good sampling frame since a list of \r\n[L782] all adults in a population typically does not exist. So, it\u2019s necessary to pick a place \r\n[L783] where almost all people can be found\u2014a person\u2019s place of residence.\r\n[L784] Once we identify the desired sample for a survey, how do we contact the \r\n[L785] people to collect the data?

An advantage is that \r\n[L794] subjects are more likely to participate. A disadvantage is the cost. Also, some sub\ufffejects may not answer sensitive questions pertaining to opinions or lifestyle, such \r\n[L795] as alcohol and drug use, whether they have been victims of sexual abuse, or their \r\n[L796] HIV status that they might answer on a printed questionnaire.\r\n[L797] Telephone interview A telephone interview is like a personal interview but \r\n[L798] conducted over the phone. A main advantage is lower cost because no travel is \r\n[L799] involved. A disadvantage is that the interview might have to be short. Subjects \r\n[L800] generally aren\u2019t as patient on the phone and may hang up before starting or com\ufffepleting the interview.\r\n[L801] Self-administered questionnaire Subjects are requested to fill out a questionnaire \r\n[L802] mailed, e-mailed, or otherwise available online. An advantage is that it is cheaper \r\n[L803] than a personal interview. A disadvantage is that fewer people tend to participate.\r\n[L804] So which method is most used? Most major national polls that survey regularly \r\n[L805] to measure public opinion use the telephone interview. An example is the polls \r\n[L806] conducted by the Gallup organization. The General Social Survey is an exception, \r\n[L807] using personal interviews for its questionnaire, which is quite long.\r\n[L808] For telephone interviews, since the mid-1980s, many sample surveys have used \r\n[L809] random digit dialing to select households. The survey can then obtain a sample \r\n[L810] without having a sampling frame. In the United States, typically the area code \r\n[L811] and the 3-digit exchange are randomly selected from the list of all such codes and \r\n[L812] exchanges. Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\n[L813] randomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\n[L814] randomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\n[L815] likely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\n[L816] exactly one telephone?)\r\n[L817] Sources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\n[L818] A variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\n[L819] the population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\n[L820] of the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n[L821] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L822] Besides Gallup, there are other polling \r\n[L823] groups that conduct national surveys, \r\n[L824] such\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\n[L825] people-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n[L826] (www.zogby.com).

The main way \r\n[L836] this occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\n[L837] undercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\n[L838] the population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\n[L839] prison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\n[L840] consists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\n[L841] landlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\n[L842] those who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\n[L843] are in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\n[L844] sampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\n[L845] Nonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\n[L846] cannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\n[L847] subjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\n[L848] in some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\n[L849] issues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\n[L850] questions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\n[L851] suffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\n[L852] telephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\n[L853] nonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\n[L854] only about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\n[L855] contact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\n[L856] Results have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\n[L857] in her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\n[L858] feminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\n[L859] States. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\n[L860] least five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\n[L861] questionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\n[L862] large. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\n[L863] know whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\n[L864] of the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\n[L865] adult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\n[L866] of using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\n[L867] Response bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\n[L868] This is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\n[L869] way, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\n[L870] lie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\n[L871] the response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\n[L872] If you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\n[L873] questions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\n[L874] long, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\n[L875] Roper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II. In response to \r\n[L876] the question, \u201cDoes it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the \r\n[L877] Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?\u201d 22% said it was possible the \r\n[L878] Holocaust never happened. The Roper organization later admitted that the ques\ufffetion was worded in a confusing manner. When it asked, \u201cDoes it seem possible \r\n[L879] to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel \r\n[L880] certain that it happened?\u201d only 1% said it was possible it never happened.4\r\n[L881] Even the order in which questions are asked can dramatically influence re\ufffesults. One study5\r\n[L882]  asked, during the Cold War, \u201cDo you think the U.S. should let \r\n[L883] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L884] There is bias if the way in which \r\n[L885] the study was designed or the \r\n[L886] data were gathered made certain \r\n[L887] outcomes occur more or less often \r\n[L888] in the sample than they do in the \r\n[L889] population. For example, consider \r\n[L890] the population of adults in your \r\n[L891] home town. The results of an opinion \r\n[L892] survey asking about raising the sales \r\n[L893] tax to support public schools may \r\n[L894] be biased in the direction of raising \r\n[L895] taxes if you sample only educators \r\n[L896] or biased in the direction of lowering \r\n[L897] taxes if you sample only business \r\n[L898] owners. Alternatively, the results \r\n[L899] could be biased toward raising taxes \r\n[L900] if a higher proportion of educators \r\n[L901] responded than business owners.\r\n[L902] ,Q3UDFWLFH Be Alert for \r\n[L903] Potential Bias\r\n[L904] With any sample survey, carefully \r\n[L905] scrutinize the results.

Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L932] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L933] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L934] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L935] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L936] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L937] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L938] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L939] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L940] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L941] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L942] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L943] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L944] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L945] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L946] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L947] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L948] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L949] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L950] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L951] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L952] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L953] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L954] than the general population.\r\n[L955] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L956] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L957] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L958] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L959] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L960] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L961] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L962] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L963] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.","[L964] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>","[L965] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L966] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L967] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L968] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L969] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L970] and Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\n[L971] because they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\n[L972] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L973] planned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n[L974] 2.3 million people returned the questionnaire. The Digest predicted that \r\n[L975] Landon would win, getting 57% of the vote. Instead, Landon actually got only \r\n[L976] 36%, and Roosevelt won in a landslide.\r\n[L977] Questions to Explore\r\n[L978] a. What was the population?\r\n[L979] b. How could the Literary Digest poll make such a large error, especially \r\n[L980] with such a huge sample size? What type of bias occurred in this poll?\r\n[L981] Think It Through\r\n[L982] a. The population was all registered voters in the United States in 1936.\r\n[L983] b. This survey had two severe problems:\r\n[L984] j Sampling bias due to undercoverage of the sampling frame and a \r\n[L985] nonrandom sample: In 1936, the United States was in the Great \r\n[L986] Depression. Those who had cars and country club memberships \r\n[L987] and thus received questionnaires tended to be wealthy. The wealthy \r\n[L988] tended to be primarily Republican, the political party of Landon. \r\n[L989] Many potential voters were not on the lists used for the sampling \r\n[L990] frame. There was also no guarantee that a subject in the sampling \r\n[L991] frame was a registered voter.\r\n[L992] j Nonresponse bias: Of the 10 million people who received question\ufffenaires, 7.7 million did not respond. As might be expected, those \r\n[L993] individuals who were unhappy with the incumbent (Roosevelt) were \r\n[L994] more likely to respond.\r\n[L995] Insight\r\n[L996] For this same election, a pollster who was getting his new polling agency off the \r\n[L997] ground surveyed 50,000 people and predicted that Roosevelt would win. Who \r\n[L998] was this pollster? George Gallup. The Gallup organization is still with us today. \r\n[L999] However, the Literary Digest went out of business soon after the 1936 election.6\r\n[L1000] c Try Exercise 4.24\r\n[L1001] Example 6 \r\n[L1002] A Large Sample Size Does Not Guarantee \r\n[L1003] an\u00a0Unbiased Sample\r\n[L1004] Many people think that as long as the sample size is large, it doesn\u2019t matter how \r\n[L1005] the sample was selected.

As another example, consider trying to estimate the \r\n[L1014] average grade point average (GPA) on your campus. If you select 10 students \r\n[L1015] from the library, you can produce an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs \r\n[L1016] (assuming those students who go to the library are studying more than those who \r\n[L1017] don\u2019t). If you, instead, gather a larger sample of 30 students from the library, you \r\n[L1018] still have an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs. The larger sample size \r\n[L1019] did not fix the problem of sampling in the library. Many Internet surveys have \r\n[L1020] thousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\n[L1021] as a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller. We\u2019re almost \r\n[L1022] always better off with a simple random sample of 100 people than with a volunteer \r\n[L1023] sample of thousands of people.\r\n[L1024] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Sample Survey\r\n[L1025] j Identify the population of all the subjects of interest.\r\n[L1026] j Define a sampling frame, which attempts to list all the subjects in the population.\r\n[L1027] j Use a random sampling design, implemented using random numbers, to select n\r\n[L1028] subjects from the sampling frame.\r\n[L1029] j Be cautious about sampling bias due to nonrandom samples (such as volunteer \r\n[L1030] samples) and sample undercoverage, response bias from subjects not giving their \r\n[L1031] true response or from poorly worded questions, and nonresponse bias from refusal \r\n[L1032] of subjects to participate.\r\n[L1033] In Section 4.1 we learned that experimental studies are preferable to nonex\ufffeperimental studies but are not always possible. Some types of nonexperimental \r\n[L1034] studies have fewer potential pitfalls than others. For a sample survey with random \r\n[L1035] sampling, we can make inferences about the population of interest. By contrast, \r\n[L1036] with a study using a convenience sample, results apply only to those subjects actu\ufffeally observed. For this reason, some researchers use the term observational study\r\n[L1037] to refer only to studies that use available subjects (such as a convenience sample) \r\n[L1038] and not to sample surveys that randomly select their sample.\r\n[L1039] 4.15 Choosing officers A campus club consists of five officers: \r\n[L1040] president (P), vice president (V), secretary (S), treasurer \r\n[L1041] (T), and activity coordinator (A). The club can select two \r\n[L1042] officers to travel to New Orleans for a conference; for \r\n[L1043] fairness, they decide to make the selection at random. In \r\n[L1044] essence, they are choosing a simple random sample of size \r\n[L1045] n = 2.\r\n[L1046] a. What are the possible samples of two officers?\r\n[L1047] b.

First, let\u2019s recall the \r\n[L1222] definition of an experimental study from Section 4.1: We assign each subject to an \r\n[L1223] experimental condition, called a treatment. We then observe the outcome on the \r\n[L1224] response variable. The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L1225] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L1226] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L1227] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L1228] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L1229] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L1230] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1231] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L1232] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L1233] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L1234] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L1235] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L1236] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L1237] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L1238] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L1239] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L1240] would like to quit.\r\n[L1241] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L1242] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L1243] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L1244] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L1245]  You need \r\n[L1246] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L1247] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L1248] 8\r\n[L1249] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L1250] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.","[L1251] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>","[L1252] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L1253] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L1254] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L1255] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L1256] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L1257] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L1258] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L1259] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L1260] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L1261] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L1262] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L1263] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L1264] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L1265] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L1266] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L1267] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L1268] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L1269] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\n[L1270] subjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\n[L1271] antidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\n[L1272] control group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n[L1273] 33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\n[L1274] compared to the placebo group.\r\n[L1275] In some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\n[L1276] than a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\n[L1277] an antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\n[L1278] It may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\n[L1279] patch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\n[L1280] a placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\n[L1281] nicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\n[L1282] Randomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\n[L1283] subjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\n[L1284] treatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\n[L1285] the study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\n[L1286] subconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\n[L1287] group that receives the antidepressant.\r\n[L1288] It is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\n[L1289] the 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\n[L1290] control group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\n[L1291] younger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\n[L1292] making them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\n[L1293] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L1294] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L1295] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L1296] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L1297] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L1298] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L1299] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L1300] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L1301] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L1302] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L1303] one treatment.","[L1304] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>","[L1305] 200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1306] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L1307] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L1308] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L1309] An analysis9\r\n[L1310]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L1311] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L1312] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L1313] studies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L1314] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L1315] 9\r\n[L1316] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L1317] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L1318] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L1319] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L1320] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L1321] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L1322] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L1323] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L1324] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L1325] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L1326] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L1327] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L1328] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L1329] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L1330] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L1331] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L1332] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L1333] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1334] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L1335] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L1336] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L1337] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L1338] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L1339] The other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\n[L1340] study observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\n[L1341] Questions to Explore\r\n[L1342] a.

They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\n[L1365] of the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\n[L1366] to the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group). The \r\n[L1367] procedure would be as follows:\r\n[L1368] j Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\n[L1369] j Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\n[L1370] bupropion group.\r\n[L1371] j Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\n[L1372] values between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\n[L1373] will receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n[L1374]  control group.\r\n[L1375] c. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\n[L1376] whether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\n[L1377] sources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\n[L1378] abstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\n[L1379] Insight\r\n[L1380] In the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\n[L1381] year, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\n[L1382] with 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\n[L1383] were not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects. However, after \r\n[L1384] two years, the percentage of nonsmokers was similar for the two groups, 42% \r\n[L1385] versus 40%.\r\n[L1386] c Try Exercise 4.32\r\n[L1387] ,Q3UDFWLFH The Randomized \r\n[L1388] Experiment in Medicine\r\n[L1389] In medicine, the randomized \r\n[L1390] experiment (clinical trial) has become \r\n[L1391] the gold standard for evaluating new \r\n[L1392] medical treatments.

But some studies mistakenly try to generalize \r\n[L1411] to a broader population than the one from which the sample was taken. A psy\ufffechologist may conduct an experiment using a sample of students from an intro\ufffeductory psychology course. For the results to be of wider interest, however, the \r\n[L1412] psychologist might claim that the conclusions generalize to all college students, \r\n[L1413] to all young adults, or even to all adults. Such generalizations may be wrong since \r\n[L1414] the sample may differ from those populations in fundamental ways such as in \r\n[L1415] average socioeconomic status, race, or gender, or attitudes.\r\n[L1416] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1417] j A good experiment has a control comparison group, randomization in assigning \r\n[L1418] experimental units to treatments, and blinding.\r\n[L1419] j The experimental units are the subjects\u2014the people, animals, or other objects to \r\n[L1420] which the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1421] j The treatments are the experimental conditions imposed on the experimental \r\n[L1422] units. One of these may be a control (for instance, either a placebo or an existing \r\n[L1423] treatment) that provides a basis for determining whether a particular treatment is \r\n[L1424] effective. The treatments correspond to values of an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1425] j Randomly assign the experimental units to the treatments. This tends to balance \r\n[L1426] the comparison groups with respect to lurking variables.\r\n[L1427] j Replication of studies increases confidence in the conclusions.\r\n[L1428] Carefully assess the scope of conclusions in research articles, mass media, and \r\n[L1429] advertisements.

A team of researchers stud\ufffeied whether typing text messages, reading them, or a combi\ufffenation of both, while driving affect eye movements, stimulus \r\n[L1563] detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed \r\n[L1564] and headway significantly. A total sample of 977 participants \r\n[L1565] from 28 experimental studies was considered in the investi\ufffegation. Results show that typing and reading text messages \r\n[L1566] while driving adversely affected driver control ability.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\n[L1585] extended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\n[L1586] alternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\n[L1587] of observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\n[L1588] with humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\n[L1589] or more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\n[L1590] Sample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\n[L1591] Designs\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\n[L1592] Simple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\n[L1593] In practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\n[L1594] or are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\n[L1595] Sometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\n[L1596] Cluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\n[L1597] frame\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\n[L1598] information is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\n[L1599] study of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\n[L1600] students can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\n[L1601] observing each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\n[L1602] For instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\n[L1603] your city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\n[L1604] city blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\n[L1605] then select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\n[L1606] Cluster Random Sample\r\n[L1607] Divide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\n[L1608] random sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\n[L1609] cluster random sample.\r\n[L1610] For personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\n[L1611] sampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\n[L1612] many observations quickly and with little travel.\r\n[L1613] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\n[L1614] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1615] Cluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\n[L1616] j A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\n[L1617] j The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\n[L1618] The disadvantages are:\r\n[L1619] j We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\n[L1620] of precision.\r\n[L1621] j Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.","[L1622] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>","[L1623] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\n[L1624] Stratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\n[L1625] number of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement. The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L1626] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L1627] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L1628] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L1629] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L1630] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L1631] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L1632] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L1633] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L1634] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L1635] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L1636] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L1637] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\n[L1638] each subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\n[L1639] in your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\n[L1640] students who work and who don\u2019t work. However, this information may not be \r\n[L1641] available for each student.\r\n[L1642] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Stratified \r\n[L1643] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1644] Stratified random sampling has the\r\n[L1645] j Advantage that you can include in your sample enough subjects in each group \r\n[L1646] (stratum) you want to evaluate.\r\n[L1647] j Disadvantage that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into \r\n[L1648] which each subject belongs.\r\n[L1649] What\u2019s the difference between a stratified sample and a cluster sample? A \r\n[L1650] stratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L1651] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L1652] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L1653] random sample).\r\n[L1654] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L1655] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L1656] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L1657] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L1658] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L1659] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L1660] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L1661] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L1662] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L1663] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L1664] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of ","[L1665] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>","[L1666] 206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1667] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L1668] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L1669] be infeasible.\r\n[L1670] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L1671] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L1672] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L1673] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L1674] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L1675] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L1676] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L1677] sampling. Similar formulas exist for other types of random sampling, but they are \r\n[L1678] complex and beyond the scope of this text.\r\n[L1679] Table 4.1 Summary of Random Sampling Methods\r\n[L1680] Method Description Advantages\r\n[L1681] Simple random \r\n[L1682] sample\r\n[L1683] Each possible sample is equally \r\n[L1684] likely\r\n[L1685] Sample tends to be a good \r\n[L1686] reflection of the population\r\n[L1687] Cluster random \r\n[L1688] sample\r\n[L1689] Identify clusters of subjects, \r\n[L1690] take\u00a0simple random sample \r\n[L1691] of the clusters\r\n[L1692] Do not need a sampling frame \r\n[L1693] of subjects, less expensive to \r\n[L1694] implement\r\n[L1695] Stratified random \r\n[L1696] sample\r\n[L1697] Divide population into groups \r\n[L1698] (strata), take simple random \r\n[L1699]  sample from each stratum\r\n[L1700] Ensures enough subjects in each \r\n[L1701] group that you want to compare\r\n[L1702] m Figure 4.2 Ways of Randomly Sampling 40 Students.

With an observational study, it\u2019s possible that an association \r\n[L1714] is due to some lurking variable. However, observational studies do have advan\ufffetages. It\u2019s often not practical to conduct an experiment. For instance, with human \r\n[L1715] subjects it\u2019s not ethical to design an experiment to study the long-term effect of \r\n[L1716] cell phone use on getting cancer. Nevertheless, it is possible to design an observa\ufffetional study that controls for identified lurking variables.\r\n[L1717] Rather than taking a cross section of a population at some time, such as with \r\n[L1718] a sample survey, some studies are backward looking (retrospective) or forward \r\n[L1719] looking (prospective). Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\n[L1720] How can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\n[L1721] use and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\n[L1722] of subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\n[L1723] and then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups. This approach \r\n[L1724] was first applied to study smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1725] Retrospective \r\n[L1726] studies b Lung Cancer and Smoking\r\n[L1727] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1728] In 1950 in London, England, medical statisticians Austin Bradford Hill and \r\n[L1729] Richard Doll conducted one of the first studies linking smoking and lung cancer. \r\n[L1730] In 20 hospitals, they matched 709 patients admitted with lung cancer in the pre\ufffeceding year with 709 noncancer patients at the same hospital of the same gender \r\n[L1731] and within the same five-year grouping on age. All patients were queried about \r\n[L1732] their smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\n[L1733] least one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\n[L1734] to look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\n[L1735] Table 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\n[L1736] were the patients with lung cancer. The 709 controls in the second column \r\n[L1737] were the matched patients without lung cancer.\r\n[L1738] Example 8 \r\n[L1739] Table 4.2 Results of Retrospective Study of Smoking and Lung Cancer\r\n[L1740] The cases had lung cancer.

The lung \r\n[L1757] cancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\n[L1758] Insight\r\n[L1759] An inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\n[L1760] This suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1761] c Try Exercise 4.46\r\n[L1762] Case-Control Study\r\n[L1763] A case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\n[L1764] a\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\n[L1765] outcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1766] This is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\n[L1767] ethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\n[L1768] smoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\n[L1769] potential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\n[L1770] variables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\n[L1771] and hospital.\r\n[L1772] In a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\n[L1773] fixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\n[L1774] For instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\n[L1775] time to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\n[L1776] the explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\n[L1777] or control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\n[L1778] subjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\n[L1779] half the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\n[L1780] had lung cancer.\r\n[L1781] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L1782] In Example 8, the response \r\n[L1783] outcome of interest was having lung \r\n[L1784] cancer. The cases had lung cancer, \r\n[L1785] the controls did not have lung \r\n[L1786] cancer, and they were compared on \r\n[L1787] the explanatory variable\u2014whether \r\n[L1788] the subject had been a smoker \r\n[L1789] (yes\u00a0or no).\r\n[L1790] Case-control \r\n[L1791] studies b Cell Phone Use\r\n[L1792] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1793] Studies 1 and 2 about cell phone use in Example 1 were both case-control \r\n[L1794] studies. In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\n[L1795] randomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\n[L1796] cases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\n[L1797] eye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\n[L1798] subjects with the cases.\r\n[L1799] Question to Explore\r\n[L1800] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L1801] such as age?\r\n[L1802] Example 9 ","[L1803] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>","[L1804] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\n[L1805] Prospective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\n[L1806] into the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\n[L1807] Think It Through\r\n[L1808] We\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\n[L1809] such as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\n[L1810] were observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\n[L1811] researchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\n[L1812] variables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\n[L1813] provides.\r\n[L1814] When researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\n[L1815] relationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\n[L1816] is not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\n[L1817] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1818] Insight\r\n[L1819] The lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\n[L1820] the two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\n[L1821] finding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\n[L1822] to be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\n[L1823] users of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\n[L1824] c Try Exercise 4.47\r\n[L1825] Prospective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\n[L1826] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1827] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\n[L1828] began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years. The purpose of \r\n[L1829] the study was to explore relationships among diet, hormonal factors, smok\ufffeing habits, and exercise habits, and the risk of coronary heart disease, pul\ufffemonary disease, and stroke. Since the initial survey in 1976, the nurses have \r\n[L1830] filled out a questionnaire every two years.\r\n[L1831] Question to Explore\r\n[L1832] What does it mean for this observational study to be called prospective?\r\n[L1833] Think It Through\r\n[L1834] The retrospective smoking study in Example 8 looked to the past to learn \r\n[L1835] whether its lung cancer subjects had been smokers. By contrast, at the start \r\n[L1836] of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\n[L1837] would eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer. The study followed \r\n[L1838] each nurse into the future to see whether she developed that outcome and \r\n[L1839] to analyze whether certain explanatory variables (such as smoking) were \r\n[L1840] associated with it.\r\n[L1841] Example 10 \r\n[L1842] 11More information on this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00005152 and at \r\n[L1843] www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs.","[L1844] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://9817beec834ef81#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":69393,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1845] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 45>","[L1846] 210 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1847] Observational Studies and Causation\r\n[L1848] Can we ever definitively establish causation with an observational study? No, we \r\n[L1849] cannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\n[L1850] was observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\n[L1851] have caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\n[L1852] smoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\n[L1853] conducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\n[L1854] time, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\n[L1855] of lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\n[L1856] retrospective and prospective, have added more evidence. For example, when a \r\n[L1857] prospective study begun in 1951 with 35,000 doctors ended in 2001, researchers12\r\n[L1858] estimated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who \r\n[L1859] never quit. This study estimated that at least half the people who smoke from \r\n[L1860] youth are eventually killed by their habit.\r\n[L1861] Most important, studies carried out on different populations of people have \r\n[L1862] consistently concluded that smoking is associated with lung cancer, even after ad\ufffejusting for all potentially confounding variables that researchers have suggested. \r\n[L1863] As more studies are done that adjust for confounding variables, the chance that a \r\n[L1864] lurking variable remains that can explain the association is reduced. As a conse\ufffequence, although we cannot definitively conclude that smoking causes lung can\ufffecer, physicians will not hesitate to tell you that they believe it does.

First, we\u2019ll learn \r\n[L1868] how a single experiment can help us analyze the effects of two explanatory vari\ufffeables at once.\r\n[L1869] Categorical explanatory variables in an experiment are often referred to as \r\n[L1870] factors. For example, consider the experiment described in Example 7 to study \r\n[L1871] whether taking an antidepressant can help a smoker stop smoking. The factor \r\n[L1872] Insight\r\n[L1873] Over the years, several analyses have been conducted using data from \r\n[L1874] the Nurses\u2019 Health Study. One finding (reported in The New York Times, \r\n[L1875] February 11, 2003) was that nurses in this study who were highly overweight \r\n[L1876] 18-year-olds were five times as likely as young women of normal weight to \r\n[L1877] need hip replacement later in life.\r\n[L1878] c Try Exercise 4.48\r\n[L1879] SUMMARY: Types of Nonexperimental Studies\r\n[L1880] j A retrospective study looks into the past.\r\n[L1881] j A prospective study identifies a group (cohort) of people and observes them in \r\n[L1882] the future.

The experiment could then have four treatment \r\n[L1899] groups that result from cross-classifying the two factors. See Figure 4.3.

Why not do one experiment \r\n[L1924] about bupropion and a separate experiment about the nicotine patch? The rea\ufffeson is that we can learn more from a two-factor experiment. For instance, the \r\n[L1925] combination of using both a nicotine patch and bupropion may be more effective \r\n[L1926] than using either method alone.\r\n[L1927] Multifactor \r\n[L1928] experiments b Antidepressants and/or Nicotine Patches\r\n[L1929] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1930] Example 7 analyzed a study about whether bupropion helps a smoker quit \r\n[L1931] cigarettes.

Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L2005] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L2006] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L2007] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L2008] applied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\n[L2009] can\u2019t use many fields.\r\n[L2010] Blocking in an Experiment\r\n[L2011] The matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements. The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\n[L2012] The crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\n[L2013] In experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\n[L2014] to as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\n[L2015] within blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\n[L2016] study, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\n[L2017] so they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\n[L2018] To reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\n[L2019] In the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\n[L2020] be randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\n[L2021] effect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\n[L2022] the second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\n[L2023] assigned to the plots in a field.\r\n[L2024] culprit. They were also pioneers in developing a sound theo\uffferetical basis for the case-control method. They followed their \r\n[L2025] initial study with other case-control studies and with a long-term \r\n[L2026] prospective study that showed that smoking was not only the \r\n[L2027] predominant risk factor for lung cancer but also correlated with \r\n[L2028] other diseases.\r\n[L2029] At first, Bradford Hill was cautious about claiming that \r\n[L2030] smoking causes lung cancer. As the evidence mounted from \r\n[L2031] various studies, he accepted the causal link as being overwhelm\ufffeingly the most likely explanation. An influential article written \r\n[L2032] by Bradford Hill in 1965 proposed criteria that should be sat\ufffeisfied before you conclude that an association reflects a causal \r\n[L2033] link. For his work, in 1961 Austin Bradford Hill was knighted by \r\n[L2034] Queen Elizabeth. Richard Doll was knighted in 1971.\r\n[L2035] In the mid-20th century, Austin Bradford Hill was Britain\u2019s \r\n[L2036] leading medical statistician. In 1946, to assess the effect of strep\ufffetomycin in treating pulmonary tuberculosis, he designed what is \r\n[L2037] now regarded as the first controlled randomized medical exper\ufffeiment. About that time, doctors noticed the alarming increase \r\n[L2038] in the number of lung cancer cases. The cause was unknown \r\n[L2039] but suspected to be atmospheric pollution, particularly coal \r\n[L2040] smoke. In 1950, Bradford Hill and medical doctor and epidemi\ufffeologist Richard Doll published results of the case-control study \r\n[L2041] (Example 8) that identified smoking as a potentially important \r\n[L2042] How did statisticians become pioneers \r\n[L2043] in examining the effects of\u00a0smoking on \r\n[L2044] lung cancer?\r\n[L2045] On the Shoulders of. . .Austin Bradford Hill (1897\u20131991) \r\n[L2046] and Richard Doll (1912\u20132005) ","[L2047] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 36 / 45>","[L2048] 214 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L2049] 4.42 Student loan debt A researcher wants to compare \r\n[L2050]  student loan debt for students who attend four-year public \r\n[L2051] universities with those who attend four-year private uni\ufffeversities.

The sports website ESPN.com asked visitors \r\n[L2289] of the site which team would win the Southeast region. \r\n[L2290] CHAPTER SUMMARY \r\n[L2291] This chapter introduced methods for gathering data.\r\n[L2292] j An experiment assigns subjects to experimental conditions (such \r\n[L2293] as drug or placebo) called treatments. These are categories of \r\n[L2294] the explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\n[L2295] is then observed for each subject.\r\n[L2296] j An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\n[L2297] that observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\n[L2298] observes rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\n[L2299] Since association does not imply causation, with observational \r\n[L2300] studies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\n[L2301] influence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\n[L2302] randomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\n[L2303] to the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\n[L2304] variables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\n[L2305] causation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\n[L2306] with neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\n[L2307] treatment a subject was assigned.\r\n[L2308] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\n[L2309] a sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\n[L2310] incorporate random sampling.\r\n[L2311] j A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\n[L2312] in which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\n[L2313] being selected.\r\n[L2314] j A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\n[L2315] clusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\n[L2316] as the sample.\r\n[L2317] j A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\n[L2318] groups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\n[L2319] from each stratum.\r\n[L2320] Be cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\n[L2321] such as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\n[L2322] random sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\n[L2323] nonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\n[L2324] are biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\n[L2325] Most sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\n[L2326] with many experiments. Medical studies often use retrospective\r\n[L2327] observational studies, which look at subjects\u2019 behavior in the past.\r\n[L2328] j A case-control study is an example of a retrospective study. \r\n[L2329] Subjects who have a response outcome of interest, such as \r\n[L2330] cancer, serve as cases. Other subjects not having that outcome \r\n[L2331] serve as controls. The cases and controls are compared on an \r\n[L2332] explanatory variable, such as whether they had been smokers.\r\n[L2333] A categorical explanatory variable in an experiment is also called a \r\n[L2334] factor. Multifactor experiments have at least two explanatory vari\ufffeables. With a completely randomized design, subjects are assigned \r\n[L2335] randomly to categories of each explanatory variable. Some designs \r\n[L2336] instead use blocks\u2014sets of experimental units that are matched. \r\n[L2337] Matched-pairs designs have two observations in each block. Often \r\n[L2338] this is the same subject observed for each of two treatments, such as \r\n[L2339] in a crossover study.\r\n[L2340] Data are only as good as the method used to obtain them. \r\n[L2341] Unless we use a good study design, conclusions may be faulty.","[L2342] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 45>","[L2343] Chapter Problems 217\r\n[L2344] c.

Meanwhile, the \r\n[L2641] percentage of the population who has tried marijuana \r\n[L2642] has increased dramatically in the United States over the \r\n[L2643] past 50 years, whereas the percentage of the population \r\n[L2644] affected by schizophrenia has remained constant at about \r\n[L2645] 1%.

When patients enrolling in the study are told the \r\n[L2685]  purpose of the study, explain why they may be reluc\ufffetant to be randomly assigned to one of the treatments.\r\n[L2686] c. If a researcher planning the study thinks the new treat\ufffement is likely to be better, explain why he or she may \r\n[L2687] have an ethical dilemma in proceeding with the study.\r\n[L2688] 4.92 Compare smokers with nonsmokers Example 8 and \r\n[L2689] Table 4.2 described a case-control study on smoking and \r\n[L2690] lung cancer. Explain carefully why it is not sensible to use \r\n[L2691] the study\u2019s proportion of smokers who had lung cancer \r\n[L2692] (that is, 688> 1688 + 6502) and proportion of nonsmokers \r\n[L2693] who had lung cancer 121> 121 + 5922 to estimate corre\ufffesponding proportions of smokers and nonsmokers who \r\n[L2694] have lung cancer in the overall population.\r\n[L2695] 4.93 Is a vaccine effective? A vaccine is claimed to be \r\n[L2696]  effective in preventing a rare disease that occurs in about \r\n[L2697] one of every 100,000 people. Explain why a randomized \r\n[L2698] clinical trial comparing 100 people who get the vaccine \r\n[L2699] to 100 people who do not get it is unlikely to be worth \r\n[L2700] doing.

Explain.\r\n[L2709] 4.86 Judging sampling design In each of the following situa\ufffetions, summarize negative aspects of the sample design.\r\n[L2710] a. A newspaper asks readers to vote at its Internet \r\n[L2711] site to determine whether they believe government \r\n[L2712] expenditures should be reduced by cutting social \r\n[L2713]  programs. Based on 1434 votes, the newspaper \r\n[L2714]  reports that 93% of the city\u2019s residents believe that \r\n[L2715] social programs should be reduced.\r\n[L2716] b. A congresswoman reports that letters to her office are \r\n[L2717] running 3 to 1 in opposition to the passage of stricter \r\n[L2718] gun control laws. She concludes that approximately 75% \r\n[L2719] of her constituents oppose stricter gun control laws.\r\n[L2720] c. An anthropology professor wants to compare attitudes \r\n[L2721] toward premarital sex of physical science majors and \r\n[L2722] social science majors. She administers a question\ufffenaire to her Anthropology 437, Comparative Human \r\n[L2723] Sexuality class. She finds no appreciable difference in \r\n[L2724] attitudes between the two majors, so she concludes \r\n[L2725] that the two student groups are about the same in their \r\n[L2726] views about premarital sex.\r\n[L2727] d. A questionnaire is mailed to a simple random sample \r\n[L2728] of 500 household addresses in a city. Ten are returned as \r\n[L2729] bad addresses, 63 are returned completed, and the rest \r\n[L2730] are not returned. The researcher analyzes the 63\u00a0cases \r\n[L2731] and reports that they represent a \u201csimple random \r\n[L2732]  sample of city households.\u201d\r\n[L2733] 4.87 More poor sampling designs Repeat the previous exercise \r\n[L2734] for the following scenarios:\r\n[L2735] a. A principal in a large high school wants to sample \r\n[L2736]  student attitudes toward a proposal that seniors must \r\n[L2737] pass a general achievement test to graduate. She lists all \r\n[L2738] of the first-period classes. Then, using a random num\ufffeber table, she chooses a class at random and interviews \r\n[L2739] every student in that class about the proposed test.\r\n[L2740] b. A new restaurant opened in January. In June, after \r\n[L2741] six months of operation, the owner applied for a loan \r\n[L2742] to improve the building. The loan application asked \r\n[L2743] for the annual gross income of the business. The \r\n[L2744] owner\u2019s record book contains receipts for each day \r\n[L2745] of operation since opening. She decides to calculate \r\n[L2746] the average daily receipt based on a sample of the \r\n[L2747] daily records and multiply that by the number of days \r\n[L2748] of operation in a year. She samples every Friday\u2019s \r\n[L2749] record. The average daily receipt for this sample was \r\n[L2750] then used to estimate the yearly receipts.\r\n[L2751] 4.88 Age for legal alcohol You want to investigate the opin\ufffeions students at your school have about whether the age \r\n[L2752] for legal drinking of alcohol should be 18.\r\n[L2753] a. Write a question to ask about this in a sample survey \r\n[L2754] in such a way that results would be biased.

This result suggests it is better not to use randomiza\ufffetion in medical studies because it is harder to show \r\n[L2759] that new ideas are beneficial.\r\n[L2760] b. Some newspaper articles that suggest a particular food, \r\n[L2761] drug, or environmental agent is harmful or beneficial \r\n[L2762] should be viewed skeptically unless we learn more \r\n[L2763] about the statistical design and analysis for the study.\r\n[L2764] c. This result shows the value of case-control studies \r\n[L2765] over randomized studies.\r\n[L2766] d. The randomized studies were poorly conducted, \r\n[L2767] or\u00a0they would have found the new treatment to be \r\n[L2768] better much more than 9% of the time.\r\n[L2769] 4.99 Multiple choice: Opinion and question wording \r\n[L2770] A recent General Social Survey asked subjects whether \r\n[L2771] they supported legalized abortion in each of seven cir\ufffecumstances. The percentage who supported legalization \r\n[L2772] varied between 44.6% (if the woman is not married) to \r\n[L2773] 88.6% (if the woman\u2019s health is seriously endangered \r\n[L2774] by the pregnancy). This indicates that\r\n[L2775] a. Responses can depend greatly on the question \r\n[L2776] wording.\r\n[L2777] b. Nonexperimental studies can never be trusted.\r\n[L2778] c. The sample must not have been randomly selected.\r\n[L2779] d. The sample must have had problems with response bias.\r\n[L2780] 4.100 Multiple choice: Campaign funding When the \r\n[L2781] Yankelovich polling organization asked, \u201cShould laws \r\n[L2782] be passed to eliminate all possibilities of special interests \r\n[L2783] giving huge sums of money to candidates?\u201d 80% of the \r\n[L2784] sample answered yes. When they posed the question, \r\n[L2785] \u201cShould laws be passed to prohibit interest groups from \r\n[L2786] contributing to campaigns, or do groups have a right to \r\n[L2787] contribute to the candidate they support?\u201d only 40% said \r\n[L2788] yes (Source: A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper, by \r\n[L2789] J.

Each infant in the study was shown two \r\n[L2813] videos. One video included a figure performing a help\ufffeing action and the other included a figure performing a \r\n[L2814] hindering action. Infants were presented with two toys \r\n[L2815] resembling the helping and hindering figures from the \r\n[L2816] videos and allowed to choose one of the toys to play with. \r\n[L2817] The researchers conjectured that, even at a very young \r\n[L2818] age, the infants would tend to choose the helpful object.\r\n[L2819] a. How might the results of this study been biased had \r\n[L2820] each infant been shown the video with the helpful figure \r\n[L2821] before being shown the video with the hindering figure?\r\n[L2822] b. How could such a potential bias be eliminated?\r\n[L2823] 4.95 Distinguish helping and hindering among infants, \r\n[L2824]  continued In the previous exercise, we considered how \r\n[L2825] showing each baby in the study the two videos in the \r\n[L2826] same order might create a bias. In fact, of the 16 babies \r\n[L2827] in the study, half were shown the videos in one order \r\n[L2828] while the other half was shown the videos in the opposite \r\n[L2829]  order. Explain how to use the Random Numbers web app \r\n[L2830] to randomly divide the 16 infants into two groups of 8.\r\n[L2831] 4.96 Distinguish helping and hindering among infants, \r\n[L2832]  continued Fourteen of the 16 infants in the Yale study \r\n[L2833] elected to play with a toy resembling the helpful figure as \r\n[L2834] opposed to one resembling the hindering figure. Is this \r\n[L2835] convincing evidence that infants tend to prefer the helpful \r\n[L2836] figure? Use the Random Numbers web app on the book\u2019s \r\n[L2837] website to investigate the approximate likelihood of the \r\n[L2838] observed results of 14 out of 16 infants choosing the help\ufffeful figure, if in fact infants are indifferent between the two \r\n[L2839] figures.

(Hint: When you sample \r\n[L2880] individuals, explain why you are more likely to sample \r\n[L2881] a large family than a small family.

Capture\u2013 \r\n[L2888] recapture is one method for doing this. A biologist \r\n[L2889] wants to count the deer population in a certain region. \r\n[L2890] She captures 50 deer, tags each, and then releases them. \r\n[L2891] Several weeks later, she captures 125 deer and finds \r\n[L2892] that 12 of them were tagged. Let N = population size,\r\n[L2893] M = size of first sample, n = size of second sample, \r\n[L2894] R = number tagged in second sample.

It states that \u201cresearch \r\n[L2905] for the Bar found that over 40 percent of female junior \r\n[L2906] tenants said they had encountered sexual harassment \r\n[L2907] during their time at the Bar.\u201d This was based on a study \r\n[L2908] conducted at the University of Sheffield that sent a \r\n[L2909] questionnaire to 334 junior tenants at the Bar, of whom \r\n[L2910] 159 responded. Of the 159, 67 were female. Of those \r\n[L2911] females, 3 said they had experienced sexual harassment \r\n[L2912] as a major problem, and 24 had experienced it as a slight \r\n[L2913] problem.\r\n[L2914] a. The quoted statement might be misleading because \r\n[L2915] the nonresponse was large.\r\n[L2916] b. No one was forced to respond, so everyone had a \r\n[L2917] chance to be in the sample, which implies it was a \r\n[L2918] simple random sample.\r\n[L2919] c. This was an example of a completely randomized \r\n[L2920]  experiment, with whether a female junior tenant \r\n[L2921]  experienced sexual harassment as the response \r\n[L2922] variable.\r\n[L2923] d. This was a retrospective case-control study, with those \r\n[L2924] who received sexual harassment as the cases.\r\n[L2925] 4.103 Multiple choice: Effect of response categories A study \r\n[L2926] (N.

When the possible \r\n[L2929] responses were the six categories (up to 1\r\n[L2930] 2 hour, 1\r\n[L2931] 2 to 1 hour, \r\n[L2932] 1 to 11\r\n[L2933] 2 hours, . . . , more than 21\r\n[L2934] 2 hours), 16% of respondents \r\n[L2935] said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2936] 2 hours per day. When the \r\n[L2937] six categories were (up to 21\r\n[L2938] 2 hours, 21\r\n[L2939] 2 to 3 hours, . . . , more \r\n[L2940] than 4 hours), 38% said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2941] 2 hours \r\n[L2942] per day.\r\n[L2943] a. The samples could not have been random, or this \r\n[L2944] would not have happened.\r\n[L2945] b. This shows the importance of question design, especially \r\n[L2946] when people may be uncertain what the answer to the \r\n[L2947] question really is.\r\n[L2948] c. This study was an experiment, not an observational \r\n[L2949] study.\r\n[L2950] 4.104 Systematic sampling A researcher wants to select 1% of \r\n[L2951] the 10,000 subjects from the sampling frame. She selects \r\n[L2952] subjects by picking one of the first 100 on the list at ran\ufffedom, skipping 100 names to get the next subject, skipping \r\n[L2953] another 100 names to get the next subject, and so on. \r\n[L2954] This is called a systematic random sample.\r\n[L2955] a. With simple random sampling, (i) every subject is equally \r\n[L2956] likely to be chosen, and (ii) every possible sample of size \r\n[L2957] n is equally likely. Indicate which, if any, of (i) and (ii) \r\n[L2958] are true for systematic random samples. Explain.\r\n[L2959] In First Sample?\r\n[L2960] Yes (tagged) No (not tagged) Total\r\n[L2961] In Second Yes R n\r\n[L2962] Sample? No\r\n[L2963] Total M N\r\n[L2964] a. Identify the values of M, n, and R for the biologist\u2019s \r\n[L2965] experiment.\r\n[L2966] b. One way to estimate N lets the sample proportion of \r\n[L2967] tagged deer equal the population proportion of tagged \r\n[L2968] deer. Explain why this means that\r\n[L2969] R\r\n[L2970] n = M\r\n[L2971] N\r\n[L2972] and, hence, that the estimated population size is \r\n[L2973] N = 1M * n2 >R\r\n[L2974] c. Estimate the number of deer in the deer population \r\n[L2975] using the numbers given.\r\n[L2976] d. The U.S. Bureau of the Census uses capture\u2013recapture \r\n[L2977] to make adjustments to the census by estimating the \r\n[L2978] undercount. The capture phase is the census itself \r\n[L2979] (persons are \u201ctagged\u201d by having returned their census \r\n[L2980] form and being recorded as counted), and the recap\ufffeture phase (the second sample) is the postenumerative \r\n[L2981] survey (PES) conducted after the census.

Pour the Cheddar Goldfish into \r\n[L2990] a paper bag, which represents the pond. Sample 10 of \r\n[L2991] them. For this initial sample, use Pretzel Goldfish to \r\n[L2992] replace them, to represent the tagged fish. Then select a \r\n[L2993] second sample and derive an estimate for N, the number \r\n[L2994] of Cheddar Goldfish in the original bag.

A particular value of center is \r\n[L3007] the mean area of the states. A map and a list of the states \r\n[L3008] with their areas (in square miles) are shown in the figure \r\n[L3009] and table that follow. Area for a state includes dry land \r\n[L3010] and permanent inland water surface.\r\n[L3011] Although we could use these data to calculate the actual \r\n[L3012] mean area, let\u2019s explore how well sampling performs \r\n[L3013] in estimating the mean area by sampling five states and \r\n[L3014] finding the sample mean.\r\n[L3015] a. The most convenient sampling design is to use our \r\n[L3016] eyes to pick five states from the map that we think \r\n[L3017] have areas representative of all the states. Do this, \r\n[L3018] picking five states that you believe have areas rep\uffferesentative of the actual mean area of the states. \r\n[L3019] Compute their sample mean area.\r\n[L3020] b.

When an experiment \r\n[L32] uses a convenience sample, be cautious about the extent to which results gener\ufffealize to a larger population. Look carefully at the characteristics of the sample. \r\n[L33] Do they seem representative of the overall population? If not, the results have \r\n[L34] dubious worth.\r\n[L35] b. How should the researchers assign the subjects to the two treatment \r\n[L36] groups?\r\n[L37] c. Without knowing more about this study, what would you identify as a \r\n[L38] potential problem with the study design?\r\n[L39] Think It Through\r\n[L40] a. This experiment has\r\n[L41] Response variable: Whether the subject abstains from smoking for \r\n[L42] one year (yes or no)\r\n[L43] Explanatory variable: Whether the subject received bupropion (yes \r\n[L44] or no)\r\n[L45] Treatments: bupropion, no bupropion\r\n[L46] Experimental units: The 429 volunteers who are the study subjects\r\n[L47] b.

Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\n[L23] younger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\n[L24] making them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\n[L25] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L26] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L27] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L28] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L29] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L30] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L31] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L32] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L33] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L34] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L35] one treatment.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L36] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L37] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L38] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L39] An analysis9\r\n[L40]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L41] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L42] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L43] studies having randomization and control groups.

But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L6] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L7] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L8] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L9] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L10] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L11] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L12] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L13] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L14] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L15] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L16] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L17] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L18] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L19] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L20] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\n[L21] subjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\n[L22] antidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\n[L23] control group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n[L24] 33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\n[L25] compared to the placebo group.\r\n[L26] In some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\n[L27] than a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\n[L28] an antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\n[L29] It may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\n[L30] patch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\n[L31] a placebo.

But some studies mistakenly try to generalize \r\n[L41] to a broader population than the one from which the sample was taken. A psy\ufffechologist may conduct an experiment using a sample of students from an intro\ufffeductory psychology course. For the results to be of wider interest, however, the \r\n[L42] psychologist might claim that the conclusions generalize to all college students, \r\n[L43] to all young adults, or even to all adults. Such generalizations may be wrong since \r\n[L44] the sample may differ from those populations in fundamental ways such as in \r\n[L45] average socioeconomic status, race, or gender, or attitudes.\r\n[L46] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Good Experiment\r\n[L47] j A good experiment has a control comparison group, randomization in assigning \r\n[L48] experimental units to treatments, and blinding.\r\n[L49] j The experimental units are the subjects\u2014the people, animals, or other objects to \r\n[L50] which the treatments are applied.\r\n[L51] j The treatments are the experimental conditions imposed on the experimental \r\n[L52] units. One of these may be a control (for instance, either a placebo or an existing \r\n[L53] treatment) that provides a basis for determining whether a particular treatment is \r\n[L54] effective.

It highlights practical questions you should ask about a study design: *Is it ethically feasible? Is it efficient? What biases or lurking variables might exist?* \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L105-L118\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 2) Be clear about the *population*, the *sample*, and the *variables*\nMost studies can\u2019t measure everyone in the population of interest, so they use a **sample** instead. And many studies focus on two key variables:  \n- a **response variable** (the outcome you care about), and  \n- an **explanatory variable** (what might explain or influence the outcome). \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L132-L145\ue201\n\n**Simple example:**  \nIf you\u2019re studying whether tutoring affects exam results:  \n- response variable = exam score  \n- explanatory variable = tutoring hours (or \u201ctutored vs not tutored\u201d)\n\n---\n\n### 3) Two big study types: **observational** vs **experimental**\n**Experimental study (experiment):** the researcher **assigns** subjects to experimental conditions (**treatments**) and then measures the response. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L141-L160\ue201  \n**Observational study:** the researcher **only observes** what subjects already do\u2014no treatment is imposed. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L169-L179\ue201\n\n**Example 1 (from the text: cell phones):**  \n- In the observational studies, participants *already had* different levels of cell phone use; the researchers used questionnaires and just observed usage and cancer status. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L186-L199\ue201  \n- In the experiment (Study 3), researchers imposed \u201cphone off\u201d vs \u201cphone on\u201d conditions (a randomized crossover), then compared brain activity measured by **positron emission tomography (PET)** scans. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L67-L87\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 4) Why experiments are stronger for cause-and-effect: **lurking variables**\nA **lurking variable** is an unmeasured variable that can create or distort an association because it relates to both the explanatory and response variables. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L293-L312\ue201  \nSection 4.1 stresses: observational studies can show **association**, but *can\u2019t definitively establish causation*, because a lurking variable might be responsible. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L293-L305\ue201\n\nExperiments reduce this risk because (with random assignment) treatment groups tend to be **balanced** on other factors\u2014both known and unknown\u2014so differences in outcomes are more plausibly caused by the treatment. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L273-L287\ue201\n\n**Concrete illustration (from the text):**  \nAn observational link between heavy cell phone use and eye cancer could be \u201cexplained away\u201d by a lurking variable like computer use (if heavy phone users also use computers more, and computer exposure mattered). \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L264-L272\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 5) Why we still do observational studies: sometimes experiments are impossible\nEven if experiments are preferable for causality, they may be unrealistic because of:\n- **ethics** (you can\u2019t deliberately expose people to suspected harm for decades),\n- **practical compliance** (people won\u2019t reliably follow assigned behaviors for years),\n- **time** (waiting decades is not feasible). \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L330-L345\ue201\n\nThe section also notes that many nonexperimental studies are done because the goal isn\u2019t always causation (e.g., measuring public opinion). \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L360-L363\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 6) Don\u2019t confuse anecdotes with evidence; use reputable data sources and surveys\nPersonal stories are **anecdotal evidence** and may not represent the population (\u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data\u201d). \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L364-L377\ue201  \nFor broader questions, the text points to **sample surveys** (e.g., the **General Social Survey (GSS)**) that deliberately sample from a population. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L394-L406\ue201  \nIt also contrasts a **census** (attempt to measure everyone) with surveys/sampling, noting sampling is often more practical. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L407-L430\ue201  \nAnd it previews a key principle: **random selection** helps a sample reflect the population. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L433-L434\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Second simple example: drug testing in schools (observational vs experimental)\nA large study compared drug use rates in schools that *did* vs *did not* implement drug testing, using questionnaires\u2014this is observational because schools chose their policies, not the researchers. \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file0\ue202L224-L249\ue201  \nWhy that matters: schools with higher baseline drug use might be *more likely to adopt testing*, which can completely muddle any causal interpretation.

The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L22] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L23] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L24] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L25] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L26] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L27] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L28] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L29] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L30] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L31] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L32] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L33] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata.

Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\n[L5] How can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\n[L6] use and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\n[L7] of subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\n[L8] and then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups. This approach \r\n[L9] was first applied to study smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L10] Retrospective \r\n[L11] studies b Lung Cancer and Smoking\r\n[L12] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L13] In 1950 in London, England, medical statisticians Austin Bradford Hill and \r\n[L14] Richard Doll conducted one of the first studies linking smoking and lung cancer. \r\n[L15] In 20 hospitals, they matched 709 patients admitted with lung cancer in the pre\ufffeceding year with 709 noncancer patients at the same hospital of the same gender \r\n[L16] and within the same five-year grouping on age. All patients were queried about \r\n[L17] their smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\n[L18] least one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\n[L19] to look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\n[L20] Table 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\n[L21] were the patients with lung cancer. The 709 controls in the second column \r\n[L22] were the matched patients without lung cancer.\r\n[L23] Example 8 \r\n[L24] Table 4.2 Results of Retrospective Study of Smoking and Lung Cancer\r\n[L25] The cases had lung cancer.

The lung \r\n[L40] cancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\n[L41] Insight\r\n[L42] An inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\n[L43] This suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L44] c Try Exercise 4.46\r\n[L45] Case-Control Study\r\n[L46] A case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\n[L47] a\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\n[L48] outcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\n[L49] This is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\n[L50] ethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\n[L51] smoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\n[L52] potential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\n[L53] variables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\n[L54] and hospital.\r\n[L55] In a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\n[L56] fixed.\n# \u30102\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn4file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"4:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] If the \r\n[L2] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L3] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L4] still having an overall n = 40.

A \r\n[L23] stratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L24] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L25] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L26] random sample).\r\n[L27] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L28] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L29] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L30] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L31] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L32] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L33] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L34] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L35] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L36] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L37] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L38] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L39] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L40] be infeasible.\r\n[L41] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L42] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L43] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L44] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L45] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L46] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L47] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L48] sampling. Similar formulas exist for other types of random sampling, but they are \r\n[L49] complex and beyond the scope of this text.\n# \u30103\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn4file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"4:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Question to Explore\r\n[L2] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L3] such as age?\r\n[L4] Example 9 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\n[L5] Prospective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\n[L6] into the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\n[L7] Think It Through\r\n[L8] We\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\n[L9] such as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\n[L10] were observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\n[L11] researchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\n[L12] variables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\n[L13] provides.\r\n[L14] When researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\n[L15] relationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\n[L16] is not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\n[L17] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L18] Insight\r\n[L19] The lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\n[L20] the two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\n[L21] finding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\n[L22] to be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\n[L23] users of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\n[L24] c Try Exercise 4.47\r\n[L25] Prospective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\n[L26] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L27] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\n[L28] began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years. The purpose of \r\n[L29] the study was to explore relationships among diet, hormonal factors, smok\ufffeing habits, and exercise habits, and the risk of coronary heart disease, pul\ufffemonary disease, and stroke. Since the initial survey in 1976, the nurses have \r\n[L30] filled out a questionnaire every two years.\r\n[L31] Question to Explore\r\n[L32] What does it mean for this observational study to be called prospective?\r\n[L33] Think It Through\r\n[L34] The retrospective smoking study in Example 8 looked to the past to learn \r\n[L35] whether its lung cancer subjects had been smokers. By contrast, at the start \r\n[L36] of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\n[L37] would eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer. The study followed \r\n[L38] each nurse into the future to see whether she developed that outcome and \r\n[L39] to analyze whether certain explanatory variables (such as smoking) were \r\n[L40] associated with it.\r\n[L41] Example 10 \r\n[L42] 11More information on this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00005152 and at \r\n[L43] www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs.<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 45><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 45>210 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L44] Observational Studies and Causation\r\n[L45] Can we ever definitively establish causation with an observational study? No, we \r\n[L46] cannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\n[L47] was observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\n[L48] have caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\n[L49] smoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\n[L50] conducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\n[L51] time, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\n[L52] of lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\n[L53] retrospective and prospective, have added more evidence.\n# \u30104\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn4file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"4:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Lung Cancer\r\n[L2] Smoker Yes (case) No (control)\r\n[L3] Yes 688 650\r\n[L4] No 21 59\r\n[L5] Total 709 709\r\n[L6] Question to Explore\r\n[L7] Compare the proportions of smokers for the lung cancer cases and the con\ufffetrols.

The lung \r\n[L14] cancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\n[L15] Insight\r\n[L16] An inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\n[L17] This suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L18] c Try Exercise 4.46\r\n[L19] Case-Control Study\r\n[L20] A case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\n[L21] a\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\n[L22] outcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\n[L23] This is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\n[L24] ethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\n[L25] smoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\n[L26] potential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\n[L27] variables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\n[L28] and hospital.\r\n[L29] In a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\n[L30] fixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\n[L31] For instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\n[L32] time to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\n[L33] the explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\n[L34] or control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\n[L35] subjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\n[L36] half the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\n[L37] had lung cancer.\r\n[L38] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L39] In Example 8, the response \r\n[L40] outcome of interest was having lung \r\n[L41] cancer. The cases had lung cancer, \r\n[L42] the controls did not have lung \r\n[L43] cancer, and they were compared on \r\n[L44] the explanatory variable\u2014whether \r\n[L45] the subject had been a smoker \r\n[L46] (yes\u00a0or no).\r\n[L47] Case-control \r\n[L48] studies b Cell Phone Use\r\n[L49] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L50] Studies 1 and 2 about cell phone use in Example 1 were both case-control \r\n[L51] studies. In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\n[L52] randomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\n[L53] cases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\n[L54] eye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\n[L55] subjects with the cases.\r\n[L56] Question to Explore\r\n[L57] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L58] such as age?\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ed89cdda53b20f2#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":47969,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://9817beec834ef81#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":69393,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null}],"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":4,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["slurm_github_commits","slurm_github_issues","slurm_github_pulls","recording_knowledge","files_uploaded_in_conversation","slurm_github"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"28dcd739-6aae-4199-b9c7-43d297012094","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"49b23a60-b98d-4c3a-b92b-274b25f27f46","turn_exchange_id":"f3795600-3b5d-43a6-9e88-5015a9f1e6ff"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"49b23a60-b98d-4c3a-b92b-274b25f27f46","children":["ad795550-4f78-45f1-9f0d-a2defbe7bd1c"]},"ad795550-4f78-45f1-9f0d-a2defbe7bd1c":{"id":"ad795550-4f78-45f1-9f0d-a2defbe7bd1c","message":{"id":"ad795550-4f78-45f1-9f0d-a2defbe7bd1c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766204033.451945,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for remaining experimental methods and definitions","content":"I\u2019ve found definitions for cluster random sampling, stratified sampling, case-control studies, and prospective designs.

Another example \r\n[L53] of a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\n[L54] An additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types.

The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\n[L26] The crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\n[L27] In experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\n[L28] to as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\n[L29] within blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\n[L30] study, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\n[L31] so they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\n[L32] To reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\n[L33] In the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\n[L34] be randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\n[L35] effect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\n[L36] the second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\n[L37] assigned to the plots in a field.\r\n[L38] culprit. They were also pioneers in developing a sound theo\uffferetical basis for the case-control method. They followed their \r\n[L39] initial study with other case-control studies and with a long-term \r\n[L40] prospective study that showed that smoking was not only the \r\n[L41] predominant risk factor for lung cancer but also correlated with \r\n[L42] other diseases.\r\n[L43] At first, Bradford Hill was cautious about claiming that \r\n[L44] smoking causes lung cancer. As the evidence mounted from \r\n[L45] various studies, he accepted the causal link as being overwhelm\ufffeingly the most likely explanation.

Why \r\n[L30] bother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\n[L31] than for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\n[L32] the following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\n[L33] use a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\n[L34] body never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\n[L35] more common for those who used cell phones.\r\n[L36] There are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\n[L37] j It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\n[L38] subjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\n[L39] harmful.\r\n[L40] j It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told.

To measure the effects on \r\n[L47] people of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\n[L48] uses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\n[L49] populations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\n[L50] when we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\n[L51] studies.

It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\n[L33] instead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\n[L34] your personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\n[L35] phone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\n[L36] Informal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\n[L37] there is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\n[L38] disprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\n[L39] a pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\n[L40] association does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal.

The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L3] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L4] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L5] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L6] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L7] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L8] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L9] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L10] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L11] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L12] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L13] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L14] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L15] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L16] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L17] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L18] would like to quit.\r\n[L19] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L20] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L21] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L22] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L23]  You need \r\n[L24] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L25] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L26] 8\r\n[L27] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L28] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L29] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L30] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L31] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L32] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L33] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L34] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L35] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L36] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L37] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L38] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L39] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L40] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L41] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L42] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L43] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L44] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L45] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse.\n# \u30103\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn6file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"6:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] The health of \r\n[L2] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L3] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L4] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L5] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L6] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L7] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L8] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L9] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L10] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L11] differences, on the average.\r\n[L12] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L13] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L14] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L15] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L16] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L17] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L18] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L19] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L20] imply causation.\r\n[L21] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L22] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L23] with an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\n[L24] which treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\n[L25] explanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\n[L26] discovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study.

As another example, consider trying to estimate the \r\n[L39] average grade point average (GPA) on your campus. If you select 10 students \r\n[L40] from the library, you can produce an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs \r\n[L41] (assuming those students who go to the library are studying more than those who \r\n[L42] don\u2019t). If you, instead, gather a larger sample of 30 students from the library, you \r\n[L43] still have an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs. The larger sample size \r\n[L44] did not fix the problem of sampling in the library. Many Internet surveys have \r\n[L45] thousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\n[L46] as a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller.

Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L3] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L4] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L5] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L6] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L7] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L8] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L9] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L10] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L11] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L12] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L13] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L14] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L15] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L16] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L17] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L18] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L19] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L20] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L21] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L22] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L23] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L24] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L25] than the general population.\r\n[L26] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L27] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L28] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L29] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L30] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L31] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L32] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L33] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L34] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population.

Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\n[L4] randomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\n[L5] randomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\n[L6] likely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\n[L7] exactly one telephone?)\r\n[L8] Sources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\n[L9] A variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\n[L10] the population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\n[L11] of the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n[L12] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L13] Besides Gallup, there are other polling \r\n[L14] groups that conduct national surveys, \r\n[L15] such\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\n[L16] people-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n[L17] (www.zogby.com).

The main way \r\n[L24] this occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\n[L25] undercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\n[L26] the population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\n[L27] prison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\n[L28] consists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\n[L29] landlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\n[L30] those who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\n[L31] are in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\n[L32] sampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\n[L33] Nonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\n[L34] cannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\n[L35] subjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\n[L36] in some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\n[L37] issues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\n[L38] questions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\n[L39] suffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\n[L40] telephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\n[L41] nonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\n[L42] only about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\n[L43] contact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\n[L44] Results have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\n[L45] in her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\n[L46] feminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\n[L47] States. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\n[L48] least five years have extramarital affairs.\n# \u30104\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"7:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L2] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L3] Sampling Frame\r\n[L4] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L5] taken.\r\n[L6] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L7] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L8] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L9] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L10] of registered students.\r\n[L11] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L12] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L13] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L14] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L15] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L16] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L17] doubtful.\r\n[L18] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L19] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L20] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L21] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L22] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L23] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L24] be misleading.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L25] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L26] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L27] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L28] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L29] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L30] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L31] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L32] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L33] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L34] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L35] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L36] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L37] 5HFDOO\r\n[L38] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L39] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L40] called the sample size. b\r\n[L41] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L42] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L43] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L44] Simple random \r\n[L45] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L46] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L47] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L48] a dinner banquet and raffle.

Cell \r\n[L42] phones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\n[L43] main source of this energy. The closer \r\n[L44] the antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\n[L45] greater the exposure to radiation. \r\n[L46] With the increased use of cell phones, \r\n[L47] there has been a growing concern \r\n[L48] over the potential health risks. Several \r\n[L49] studies have explored the possibility \r\n[L50] of such risks:\r\n[L51] Study 1 A German study (Stang \r\n[L52] et\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\n[L53] with a rare form of eye cancer called \r\n[L54] uveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n[L55]  patients who did not have this eye \r\n[L56] cancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\n[L57] was measured using a questionnaire. \r\n[L58] On average, the eye cancer patients \r\n[L59] used cell phones more often.\r\n[L60] Study 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\n[L61] et al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\n[L62] with brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\n[L63] without brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\n[L64] cell phone use was measured using a \r\n[L65] questionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\n[L66] two groups was similar.\r\n[L67] Study 3 A study published in The \r\n[L68] Journal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\n[L69] that cell phone use speeds up activity \r\n[L70] in the brain. As part of a randomized \r\n[L71] crossover study, 47 participants were \r\n[L72] fitted with a cell phone device on each \r\n[L73] ear and then underwent two positron \r\n[L74] emission topography, or PET, scans \r\n[L75] to measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\n[L76] During one scan, the cell phones were \r\n[L77] both turned off. During the other \r\n[L78] scan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\n[L79] call was made to the phone on the \r\n[L80] right ear. The order of when the call \r\n[L81] was received (for the first or second \r\n[L82] scan) was randomized. Comparison \r\n[L83] of the PET scans showed a significant \r\n[L84] increase in activity in the part of the \r\n[L85] brain closest to the antenna during \r\n[L86] the transmission of the automated \r\n[L87] call.\r\n[L88] Studies 1 and 3 found potential \r\n[L89] physiological responses to cell \r\n[L90] phone use.

In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L124] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L125] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L126] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L127] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L128] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L129] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L130] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L131] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L132] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L133] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L134] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L135] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L136] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L137] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L138] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L139] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L140] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L141] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L142] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L143] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L144] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L145] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L146] 5HFDOO\r\n[L147] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L148] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L149] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L150] we call the sample.\r\n[L151] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L152] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L153] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L154] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L155] variable. b\r\n[L156] Experimental Study\r\n[L157] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L158] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L159] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L160] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L161] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L162] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories ","[L163] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>","[L164] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L165] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\n[L166] the experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\n[L167] response variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\n[L168] it increased.\r\n[L169] An experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\n[L170] in the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\n[L171] By contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\n[L172] and the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\n[L173] them. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\n[L174] Observational Study\r\n[L175] In an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\n[L176] explanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\n[L177] In short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\n[L178] the study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\n[L179] treatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\n[L180] Identifying experimental \r\n[L181] versus observational \r\n[L182] studies\r\n[L183] b\r\n[L184] Cell Phone Use\r\n[L185] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L186] Example 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\n[L187] between cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body. We\u2019ve \r\n[L188] seen that Study 3 was an experiment. Studies 1 and 2 both examined the \r\n[L189] amount of cell phone use for cancer patients and for noncancer patients us\ufffeing a questionnaire.\r\n[L190] Questions to Explore\r\n[L191] a. Were Studies 1 and 2 experimental or observational studies?\r\n[L192] b. How were Studies 1 and 2 fundamentally different from Study 3 in \r\n[L193] terms of how the treatments were determined for each subject?\r\n[L194] Think It Through\r\n[L195] a. In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\n[L196] gathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\n[L197] determined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\n[L198] observed this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\n[L199] and 2 were observational studies.\r\n[L200] b. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\n[L201] the subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\n[L202] to both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\n[L203] during the second scan. The researchers imposed the treatments on \r\n[L204] the subjects. So, Study 3 was an experimental study.*\r\n[L205] Example 2 \r\n[L206] *The researchers noted that \u201cResults of this study provide evidence that acute cell phone expo\ufffesure affects brain metabolic activity. However, these results provide no information about their \r\n[L207] relevance to potential carcinogenic effects (or lack thereof) from chronic cell phone use.\u201d","[L208] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>","[L209] 182 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L210] Let\u2019s consider another study. From its description, we\u2019ll try to determine \r\n[L211] whether it is an experiment or an observational study.\r\n[L212] Insight\r\n[L213] One reason that results of different medical studies sometimes disagree is \r\n[L214] that they are not the same type of study. Experimental studies allow direct \r\n[L215] causal inference to be made, whereas observational studies do not allow \r\n[L216] causal inference. As we\u2019ll see, there are different types of both observational \r\n[L217] and experimental studies, and some are more trustworthy than others.\r\n[L218] c Try Exercises 4.1 and 4.3\r\n[L219] 1\r\n[L220] Study by R.

It reported results from a \r\n[L226] study of 76,000 students in 497 high schools and 225 middle schools nation\ufffewide.1\r\n[L227]  Each student in the study filled out a questionnaire. One question asked \r\n[L228] whether the student used drugs. The study found that drug use was similar \r\n[L229] in schools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. For \r\n[L230] instance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\n[L231] twelfth graders from the two types of schools. In addition, the figure in the \r\n[L232] margin shows the conditional proportions of drug use for these students.\r\n[L233] Questions to Explore\r\n[L234] a. What were the response and explanatory variables?\r\n[L235] b. Was this an observational study or an experiment?\r\n[L236] Example 3 \r\n[L237] Drug Use\r\n[L238] Drug Tests?

The study compared the percentage of students who used drugs in \r\n[L243] schools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. \r\n[L244] Whether the student used drugs was the response variable. The ex\ufffeplanatory variable was whether the student\u2019s school tested for drugs. \r\n[L245] Both variables were categorical, with categories \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d \r\n[L246] For each grade, the data were summarized in a contingency table, as \r\n[L247] shown in the margin for twelfth graders.\r\n[L248] b. For each student, the study merely observed whether his or her school \r\n[L249] tested for drugs and whether he or she used drugs. So this was an ob\ufffeservational study.\r\n[L250] Insight\r\n[L251] An experiment would have assigned schools to use or not use drug testing \r\n[L252] rather than leaving the decision to the schools. For instance, the study could \r\n[L253] have randomly selected half the schools to perform drug testing and half not to \r\n[L254] perform it and then, a year later, measured the student drug use in each school.\r\n[L255] c Try Exercise 4.7","[L256] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://568e66fa8c8c602#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":70436,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L257] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 45>","[L258] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 183\r\n[L259] As we will soon discuss, an experimental study gives the researcher more control \r\n[L260] over outside influences. This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\n[L261] association.\r\n[L262] Advantage of Experiments Over \r\n[L263] Observational\u00a0Studies\r\n[L264] In an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\n[L265] Example 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\n[L266] there could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\n[L267] cancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\n[L268] who do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\n[L269] a possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\n[L270] phones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\n[L271] screens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\n[L272] eye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\n[L273] By contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\n[L274] the results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\n[L275] which subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\n[L276] groups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\n[L277] similar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\n[L278] to have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\n[L279] condition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\n[L280] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L281] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L282] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L283] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L284] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L285] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L286] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L287] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L288] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L289] differences, on the average.\r\n[L290] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L291] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L292] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L293] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L294] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L295] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L296] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L297] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L298] imply causation.\r\n[L299] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L300] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L301] with an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\n[L302] which treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\n[L303] explanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\n[L304] discovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\n[L305] conduct an experiment.\r\n[L306] 5HFDOO\r\n[L307] From Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\n[L308] a variable not observed in the study that \r\n[L309] influences the association between the \r\n[L310] response and explanatory variables due \r\n[L311] to its own association with each of those \r\n[L312] variables. b\r\n[L313] &DXWLRQ\r\n[L314] In Example 3, the problem with the \r\n[L315] conclusion they made is that schools with \r\n[L316] high rates of drug use might be more \r\n[L317] inclined to employ drug tests to address \r\n[L318] the problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\n[L319] tests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n[L320] 0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\n[L321] also conceivable that drug use rates started \r\n[L322] at 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\n[L323] the drug test program. The problem with \r\n[L324] this observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\n[L325] know which of the previous conceivable \r\n[L326] scenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\n[L327] occurred. b","[L328] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>","[L329] 184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L330] Determining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\n[L331] If experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\n[L332] bother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\n[L333] than for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\n[L334] the following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\n[L335] use a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\n[L336] body never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\n[L337] more common for those who used cell phones.\r\n[L338] There are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\n[L339] j It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\n[L340] subjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\n[L341] harmful.\r\n[L342] j It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told. How can \r\n[L343] you monitor them to ensure that they adhere to their treatment assignment \r\n[L344] over the 50-year experimental period?\r\n[L345] j Who wants to wait 50 years to get an answer?\r\n[L346] For these reasons, medical experiments are often performed over a short time \r\n[L347] period or often with exposure to treatments that would not be out of the ordinary \r\n[L348] (such as a one-time exposure to cell phone activity). To measure the effects on \r\n[L349] people of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\n[L350] uses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\n[L351] populations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\n[L352] when we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\n[L353] studies. Then we are not deliberately placing people in harm\u2019s way, but observing \r\n[L354] people who have chosen on their own to take part in the activity of interest. In \r\n[L355] today\u2019s information age, a lot of data is readily available to assist (or impede) \r\n[L356] people from making decisions about the relationship between variables. These \r\n[L357] data provide only observational comparisons. We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\n[L358] good observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\n[L359] experiment is not practical.\r\n[L360] Finally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\n[L361] questions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\n[L362] want to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\n[L363] use a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\n[L364] Using Data Already Available\r\n[L365] Of course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\n[L366] question, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\n[L367] instead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\n[L368] your personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\n[L369] phone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\n[L370] Informal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\n[L371] there is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\n[L372] disprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\n[L373] a pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\n[L374] association does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\n[L375] smoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\n[L376] is lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\n[L377] A famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n[L378] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L379] Examples of sources for available data:\r\n[L380] j General Social Survey (GSS)\r\n[L381] j http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\n[L382] j www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\n[L383] j www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\n[L384] j www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\n[L385] Kingdom)\r\n[L386] j www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)","[L387] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>","[L388] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\n[L389] research studies.

Excellent sources of available \r\n[L393] data are listed in the margin on the previous page.\r\n[L394] The Census and Other Sample Surveys\r\n[L395] The General Social Survey (GSS) is an example of a sample survey. It gathers in\ufffeformation by interviewing a sample of subjects from the U.S. adult population to \r\n[L396] provide a snapshot of that population. The study in Example 3 on student drug \r\n[L397] use in schools also used a sample survey.\r\n[L398] 2\r\n[L399] Most surveys of research about cell phones suggest that there is no convincing evidence yet of adverse \r\n[L400] radiation effects (e.g., D. R. Cox, J. Roy. Statist. Soc., Ser. A, vol. 166, pp. 241\u2013246, 2003). The primary \r\n[L401] danger appears to be people using cell phones while driving!\r\n[L402] Sample Survey\r\n[L403] A sample survey selects a sample of subjects from a population and collects data from \r\n[L404] them. In the field of statistics a survey does not just indicate an opinion poll or a question\ufffenaire; it includes any information gathered from or about the subject.\r\n[L405] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study. The subjects provide data \r\n[L406] on the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\n[L407] Most countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\n[L408] number of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\n[L409] them. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\n[L410] entire population.\r\n[L411] In Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\n[L412] of the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n[L413] 1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\n[L414] more than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\n[L415] the population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\n[L416] j The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\n[L417] census. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\n[L418] seats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\n[L419] on how their population size compares with other states.\r\n[L420] j Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\n[L421] j Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\n[L422] and local communities.\r\n[L423] Although it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\n[L424] practice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\n[L425] census bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient. \r\n[L426] Because data are needed regularly on economic variables, such as the unem\ufffeployment rate, the U.S. Bureau of the Census continually takes samples of the \r\n[L427] population rather than relying solely on the complete census. An example is the \r\n[L428] monthly Current Population Survey, which surveys about 50,000 U.S. house\ufffeholds and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the \r\n[L429] United States, including the unemployment rate. It is usually more practical, in \r\n[L430] terms of time and money, to take a sample rather than to try to measure every\ufffeone in a population.","[L431] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 45>","[L432] 186 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L433] For a sample survey to be informative, it is important for the sample to reflect \r\n[L434] the population well.

Women in the study \r\n[L591] were offered mammography screening every two years. The \r\n[L592] goal of the study was to compare incidence-based rates of \r\n[L593] death from breast cancer across four groups:\r\n[L594] 1. Women who from 1996 through 2005 were living in \r\n[L595] countries with screening.\r\n[L596] 2. Women who from 1996 through 2005 were living in \r\n[L597] countries without screening.\r\n[L598] 3.

A nationwide census is conducted \r\n[L616] in the United States every 10 years.\r\n[L617] a. Give at least two reasons the United States takes a census \r\n[L618] only every 10 years.\r\n[L619] 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\r\n[L620] The sample survey is a common type of nonexperimental study. The first step of \r\n[L621] a sample survey is to define the population targeted by the study. For instance, \r\n[L622] the Gallup organization (www.gallup.com) conducts a monthly survey of about \r\n[L623] 1000 adult Americans. Gallup then reports the percentage of those sampled who \r\n[L624] respond \u201capprove\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way [the \r\n[L625] current president of the United States] is handling his job as president?\u201d If the \r\n[L626] sampling is conducted properly, this provides a good estimate of the approval \r\n[L627] rate within the entire population. The population consists of all adults living in \r\n[L628] the United States.\r\n[L629] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L630] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L631] Sampling Frame\r\n[L632] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L633] taken.\r\n[L634] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L635] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L636] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L637] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L638] of registered students.\r\n[L639] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L640] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L641] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L642] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L643] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L644] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L645] doubtful.\r\n[L646] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L647] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L648] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L649] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L650] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L651] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L652] be misleading.","[L653] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>","[L654] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L655] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L656] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L657] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L658] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L659] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L660] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L661] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L662] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L663] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L664] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L665] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L666] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L667] 5HFDOO\r\n[L668] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L669] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L670] called the sample size. b\r\n[L671] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L672] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L673] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L674] Simple random \r\n[L675] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L676] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L677] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L678] a dinner banquet and raffle. The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\n[L679] of football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\n[L680] everyone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once. (This is \r\n[L681] called sampling without replacement.) To select the two winners, the organiz\ufffeers choose a simple random sample of size n = 2 from the 60 ticket holders. \r\n[L682] Each individual at the banquet receives an entry with a number between 1 and \r\n[L683] 60. Duplicate tickets numbered 1 to 60 are placed in a container and mixed, \r\n[L684] after which the two winning entries are chosen at random. Whoever holds the \r\n[L685] tickets containing the same numbers as those drawn at random wins the foot\ufffeball tickets.\r\n[L686] Questions to Explore\r\n[L687] a. What are the possible samples?\r\n[L688] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 will be drawn?\r\n[L689] c. Professor Shaffer is in attendance at the banquet and holds entry num\ufffeber 1. What is the chance that her entry will be chosen? Mr. Chatterjee \r\n[L690] holds entry number 55. What is the chance that his entry will be chosen?\r\n[L691] Think It Through\r\n[L692] a. The entire collection of possible samples is too long to list, but we can \r\n[L693] visualize the possibilities by listing certain pairs:\r\n[L694] (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), . . . , (1,58), (1,59), (1,60)\r\n[L695] (2,3), (2,4), . . . , (2,58), (2,59), (2,60)\r\n[L696] .\r\n[L697] .\r\n[L698] .\r\n[L699] Example 4 ","[L700] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>","[L701] 190 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L702] Selecting a Simple Random Sample\r\n[L703] What\u2019s a better way to take a simple random sample than blindly drawing slips \r\n[L704] of paper out of a hat? You first number the subjects in the sampling frame. You \r\n[L705] then generate a set of those numbers randomly. Finally, you sample the subjects \r\n[L706] whose numbers were generated. One method of generating numbers randomly \r\n[L707] is to use a random number table. In practice, technology is used to generate the \r\n[L708] sample. This could be an app or a statistical program. The following example \r\n[L709] demonstrates how a random sample is generated in MINITAB (left column).\r\n[L710] Taking a Random Sample Consider taking a random sample of three students \r\n[L711] from a class in which the following students are enrolled: Aisha, Benedict, Chung, \r\n[L712] Diego, Emily, Francisco, Girish, Hank, Isabella, and Jing.\r\n[L713] It can be done in MINITAB, as shown below.\r\n[L714] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L715] The Random Numbers web app from \r\n[L716] the book\u2019s website can also be used to \r\n[L717] generate random numbers. The screenshot \r\n[L718] in the margin next to Example 5 on the next \r\n[L719] page illustrates. b\r\n[L720] (57,58), (57,59), (57,60)\r\n[L721] (58,59), (58,60)\r\n[L722] (59,60)\r\n[L723] b. The first row above contains 59 possible samples, the second row con\ufffetains 58, and so forth. There are thus 59 + 58 + c + 2 + 1, which \r\n[L724] equals 1770 possible samples. The process of randomly selecting two \r\n[L725] unique entries ensures that each possible sample of size 2 has an equal \r\n[L726] chance of occurring. Since there are 1770 possible samples, the chance \r\n[L727] of any one sample being selected is 1 out of 1770.\r\n[L728] c. Looking at the top row in part a, we see that 1 shows up in 59 of the \r\n[L729] samples (all of the samples listed in the top row). So the chance that \r\n[L730] Professor Shaffer wins season tickets is 59 out of 1770.\r\n[L731] Insight\r\n[L732] The chance of 59/1770 for Professor Shaffer is the same as that of \r\n[L733] Mr.\u00a0Chatterjee and everyone else in attendance. In practice, especially with \r\n[L734] large populations, it is difficult to mix the entrants\u2019 numbers in a container \r\n[L735] so that each sample truly has an equal chance of selection. There are better \r\n[L736] ways of selecting simple random samples, as we\u2019ll learn next.\r\n[L737] c Try Exercise 4.16","[L738] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://2a1ab342a4235ad#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60206,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L739] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 45>","[L740] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 191\r\n[L741] When we executed this command in MINITAB, the following random sample \r\n[L742] was obtained.

It \r\n[L751] is too time-consuming and expensive for auditors to review all accounts, \r\n[L752] so they typically review only some of them. So that a school district cannot \r\n[L753] anticipate which accounts will be reviewed, the auditors often take a simple \r\n[L754] random sample of the accounts.\r\n[L755] Questions to Explore\r\n[L756] a. How can the auditors use random numbers to select 10 accounts to \r\n[L757] audit in a school district that has 60 accounts?\r\n[L758] b. Why is it important for the auditors not to use personal judgment in \r\n[L759] selecting the accounts to audit?\r\n[L760] Think It Through\r\n[L761] a. The sampling frame consists of the 60 accounts. We first number the \r\n[L762] accounts 1 through 60. Alternatively, they could list the names of the \r\n[L763] accounts. The accounts MINITAB selected (see below for details of \r\n[L764] the process) were 56, 43, 35, 47, 15, 8, 31, 9, 33, and 36. We cannot \r\n[L765] verify that these numbers are randomly selected, but we know that the \r\n[L766] process used to generate them employs random selection.\r\n[L767] b. By using simple random sampling, the auditors hold the school district \r\n[L768] responsible for all accounts. If the auditors personally chose the ac\ufffecounts to audit, they might select certain accounts each year. A school \r\n[L769] district would soon learn which accounts they need to have in order \r\n[L770] and which accounts can be given less attention.\r\n[L771] Insight\r\n[L772] Likewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) randomly selects some tax re\ufffeturns for audit, so taxpayers cannot predict ahead of time whether they will \r\n[L773] be audited. For efficiency, the IRS samples a small proportion of tax returns \r\n[L774] with small amounts owed and a larger proportion of tax returns with high \r\n[L775] amounts owed. It does this because it cares about the total amount of tax \r\n[L776] revenue brought in.\r\n[L777] c Try Exercise 4.17\r\n[L778] Example 5 \r\n[L779] Methods of Collecting Data in Sample Surveys\r\n[L780] In Example 5, the subjects sampled were accounts. More commonly, they are \r\n[L781] people. For any survey, it is difficult to get a good sampling frame since a list of \r\n[L782] all adults in a population typically does not exist. So, it\u2019s necessary to pick a place \r\n[L783] where almost all people can be found\u2014a person\u2019s place of residence.\r\n[L784] Once we identify the desired sample for a survey, how do we contact the \r\n[L785] people to collect the data?

An advantage is that \r\n[L794] subjects are more likely to participate. A disadvantage is the cost. Also, some sub\ufffejects may not answer sensitive questions pertaining to opinions or lifestyle, such \r\n[L795] as alcohol and drug use, whether they have been victims of sexual abuse, or their \r\n[L796] HIV status that they might answer on a printed questionnaire.\r\n[L797] Telephone interview A telephone interview is like a personal interview but \r\n[L798] conducted over the phone. A main advantage is lower cost because no travel is \r\n[L799] involved. A disadvantage is that the interview might have to be short. Subjects \r\n[L800] generally aren\u2019t as patient on the phone and may hang up before starting or com\ufffepleting the interview.\r\n[L801] Self-administered questionnaire Subjects are requested to fill out a questionnaire \r\n[L802] mailed, e-mailed, or otherwise available online. An advantage is that it is cheaper \r\n[L803] than a personal interview. A disadvantage is that fewer people tend to participate.\r\n[L804] So which method is most used? Most major national polls that survey regularly \r\n[L805] to measure public opinion use the telephone interview. An example is the polls \r\n[L806] conducted by the Gallup organization. The General Social Survey is an exception, \r\n[L807] using personal interviews for its questionnaire, which is quite long.\r\n[L808] For telephone interviews, since the mid-1980s, many sample surveys have used \r\n[L809] random digit dialing to select households. The survey can then obtain a sample \r\n[L810] without having a sampling frame. In the United States, typically the area code \r\n[L811] and the 3-digit exchange are randomly selected from the list of all such codes and \r\n[L812] exchanges. Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\n[L813] randomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\n[L814] randomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\n[L815] likely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\n[L816] exactly one telephone?)\r\n[L817] Sources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\n[L818] A variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\n[L819] the population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\n[L820] of the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n[L821] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L822] Besides Gallup, there are other polling \r\n[L823] groups that conduct national surveys, \r\n[L824] such\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\n[L825] people-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n[L826] (www.zogby.com). TV stations and \r\n[L827] newspapers commonly use such polling \r\n[L828] organizations to conduct polls. b\r\n[L829] m Figure 4.1 This MINITAB screen is used to generate 10 integers randomly between 1\u00a0and\u00a060, \r\n[L830] inclusively.

The main way \r\n[L836] this occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\n[L837] undercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\n[L838] the population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\n[L839] prison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\n[L840] consists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\n[L841] landlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\n[L842] those who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\n[L843] are in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\n[L844] sampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\n[L845] Nonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\n[L846] cannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\n[L847] subjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\n[L848] in some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\n[L849] issues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\n[L850] questions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\n[L851] suffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\n[L852] telephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\n[L853] nonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\n[L854] only about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\n[L855] contact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\n[L856] Results have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\n[L857] in her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\n[L858] feminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\n[L859] States. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\n[L860] least five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\n[L861] questionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\n[L862] large. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\n[L863] know whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\n[L864] of the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\n[L865] adult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\n[L866] of using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\n[L867] Response bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\n[L868] This is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\n[L869] way, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\n[L870] lie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\n[L871] the response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\n[L872] If you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\n[L873] questions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\n[L874] long, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\n[L875] Roper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II. In response to \r\n[L876] the question, \u201cDoes it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the \r\n[L877] Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?\u201d 22% said it was possible the \r\n[L878] Holocaust never happened. The Roper organization later admitted that the ques\ufffetion was worded in a confusing manner. When it asked, \u201cDoes it seem possible \r\n[L879] to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel \r\n[L880] certain that it happened?\u201d only 1% said it was possible it never happened.4\r\n[L881] Even the order in which questions are asked can dramatically influence re\ufffesults. One study5\r\n[L882]  asked, during the Cold War, \u201cDo you think the U.S. should let \r\n[L883] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L884] There is bias if the way in which \r\n[L885] the study was designed or the \r\n[L886] data were gathered made certain \r\n[L887] outcomes occur more or less often \r\n[L888] in the sample than they do in the \r\n[L889] population. For example, consider \r\n[L890] the population of adults in your \r\n[L891] home town. The results of an opinion \r\n[L892] survey asking about raising the sales \r\n[L893] tax to support public schools may \r\n[L894] be biased in the direction of raising \r\n[L895] taxes if you sample only educators \r\n[L896] or biased in the direction of lowering \r\n[L897] taxes if you sample only business \r\n[L898] owners. Alternatively, the results \r\n[L899] could be biased toward raising taxes \r\n[L900] if a higher proportion of educators \r\n[L901] responded than business owners.\r\n[L902] ,Q3UDFWLFH Be Alert for \r\n[L903] Potential Bias\r\n[L904] With any sample survey, carefully \r\n[L905] scrutinize the results. Look for \r\n[L906] information about how the sample \r\n[L907] was selected, how large the sample \r\n[L908] size was, the nonresponse rate, how \r\n[L909] the questions were worded, and who \r\n[L910] sponsored the study.

Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L932] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L933] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L934] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L935] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L936] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L937] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L938] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L939] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L940] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L941] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L942] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L943] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L944] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L945] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L946] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L947] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L948] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L949] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L950] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L951] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L952] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L953] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L954] than the general population.\r\n[L955] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L956] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L957] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L958] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L959] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L960] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L961] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L962] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L963] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.","[L964] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>","[L965] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L966] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L967] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L968] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L969] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L970] and Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\n[L971] because they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\n[L972] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L973] planned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n[L974] 2.3 million people returned the questionnaire. The Digest predicted that \r\n[L975] Landon would win, getting 57% of the vote. Instead, Landon actually got only \r\n[L976] 36%, and Roosevelt won in a landslide.\r\n[L977] Questions to Explore\r\n[L978] a. What was the population?\r\n[L979] b. How could the Literary Digest poll make such a large error, especially \r\n[L980] with such a huge sample size? What type of bias occurred in this poll?\r\n[L981] Think It Through\r\n[L982] a. The population was all registered voters in the United States in 1936.\r\n[L983] b. This survey had two severe problems:\r\n[L984] j Sampling bias due to undercoverage of the sampling frame and a \r\n[L985] nonrandom sample: In 1936, the United States was in the Great \r\n[L986] Depression. Those who had cars and country club memberships \r\n[L987] and thus received questionnaires tended to be wealthy. The wealthy \r\n[L988] tended to be primarily Republican, the political party of Landon. \r\n[L989] Many potential voters were not on the lists used for the sampling \r\n[L990] frame. There was also no guarantee that a subject in the sampling \r\n[L991] frame was a registered voter.\r\n[L992] j Nonresponse bias: Of the 10 million people who received question\ufffenaires, 7.7 million did not respond. As might be expected, those \r\n[L993] individuals who were unhappy with the incumbent (Roosevelt) were \r\n[L994] more likely to respond.\r\n[L995] Insight\r\n[L996] For this same election, a pollster who was getting his new polling agency off the \r\n[L997] ground surveyed 50,000 people and predicted that Roosevelt would win. Who \r\n[L998] was this pollster? George Gallup. The Gallup organization is still with us today. \r\n[L999] However, the Literary Digest went out of business soon after the 1936 election.6\r\n[L1000] c Try Exercise 4.24\r\n[L1001] Example 6 \r\n[L1002] A Large Sample Size Does Not Guarantee \r\n[L1003] an\u00a0Unbiased Sample\r\n[L1004] Many people think that as long as the sample size is large, it doesn\u2019t matter how \r\n[L1005] the sample was selected. This is incorrect, as illustrated by the Literary Digest\r\n[L1006] poll. A sample size of 2.3 million did not prevent poor results. The sample was \r\n[L1007] 6\r\n[L1008] Bryson, M. C. (1976), American Statistician, vol. 30, pp. 184\u2013185.","[L1009] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 45>","[L1010] 196 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1011] not representative of the population, and the sample percentage of 57% who \r\n[L1012] said they would vote for Landon was far from the actual population percentage \r\n[L1013] of 36% who voted for him. As another example, consider trying to estimate the \r\n[L1014] average grade point average (GPA) on your campus. If you select 10 students \r\n[L1015] from the library, you can produce an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs \r\n[L1016] (assuming those students who go to the library are studying more than those who \r\n[L1017] don\u2019t). If you, instead, gather a larger sample of 30 students from the library, you \r\n[L1018] still have an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs. The larger sample size \r\n[L1019] did not fix the problem of sampling in the library. Many Internet surveys have \r\n[L1020] thousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\n[L1021] as a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller. We\u2019re almost \r\n[L1022] always better off with a simple random sample of 100 people than with a volunteer \r\n[L1023] sample of thousands of people.\r\n[L1024] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Sample Survey\r\n[L1025] j Identify the population of all the subjects of interest.\r\n[L1026] j Define a sampling frame, which attempts to list all the subjects in the population.\r\n[L1027] j Use a random sampling design, implemented using random numbers, to select n\r\n[L1028] subjects from the sampling frame.\r\n[L1029] j Be cautious about sampling bias due to nonrandom samples (such as volunteer \r\n[L1030] samples) and sample undercoverage, response bias from subjects not giving their \r\n[L1031] true response or from poorly worded questions, and nonresponse bias from refusal \r\n[L1032] of subjects to participate.\r\n[L1033] In Section 4.1 we learned that experimental studies are preferable to nonex\ufffeperimental studies but are not always possible. Some types of nonexperimental \r\n[L1034] studies have fewer potential pitfalls than others. For a sample survey with random \r\n[L1035] sampling, we can make inferences about the population of interest. By contrast, \r\n[L1036] with a study using a convenience sample, results apply only to those subjects actu\ufffeally observed. For this reason, some researchers use the term observational study\r\n[L1037] to refer only to studies that use available subjects (such as a convenience sample) \r\n[L1038] and not to sample surveys that randomly select their sample.\r\n[L1039] 4.15 Choosing officers A campus club consists of five officers: \r\n[L1040] president (P), vice president (V), secretary (S), treasurer \r\n[L1041] (T), and activity coordinator (A). The club can select two \r\n[L1042] officers to travel to New Orleans for a conference; for \r\n[L1043] fairness, they decide to make the selection at random. In \r\n[L1044] essence, they are choosing a simple random sample of size \r\n[L1045] n = 2.\r\n[L1046] a. What are the possible samples of two officers?\r\n[L1047] b.

There has been much debate in the media about its \r\n[L1095] impact on the environment, on land owners, and on the \r\n[L1096] economy. The survey involved contacting a nationally \r\n[L1097] representative sample of 1960 adults in 2012. Of the 1960 \r\n[L1098] people contacted, 1061 adults responded to the survey. \r\n[L1099] The study reported that those more familiar with fracking, \r\n[L1100] women, and those holding egalitarian worldviews were \r\n[L1101] more likely to oppose fracking.\r\n[L1102] a.

The survey addressed the question of women\u2019s \r\n[L1132] participation in politics. Half the subjects were surveyed \r\n[L1133] by males and the remaining half by females. Results \r\n[L1134] showed of the respondents surveyed by males, about 37% \r\n[L1135] favored active participation of women in politics in their \r\n[L1136] country while of the respondents surveyed by females, \r\n[L1137] 67% favored the active participation of women in politics. \r\n[L1138] Which type of bias does this illustrate: sampling bias, non\uffferesponse bias, or response bias?

First, let\u2019s recall the \r\n[L1222] definition of an experimental study from Section 4.1: We assign each subject to an \r\n[L1223] experimental condition, called a treatment. We then observe the outcome on the \r\n[L1224] response variable. The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L1225] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L1226] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L1227] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L1228] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L1229] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L1230] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1231] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L1232] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L1233] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L1234] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L1235] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L1236] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L1237] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L1238] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L1239] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L1240] would like to quit.\r\n[L1241] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L1242] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L1243] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L1244] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L1245]  You need \r\n[L1246] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L1247] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L1248] 8\r\n[L1249] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L1250] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.","[L1251] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>","[L1252] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L1253] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L1254] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L1255] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L1256] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L1257] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L1258] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L1259] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L1260] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L1261] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L1262] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L1263] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L1264] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L1265] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L1266] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L1267] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L1268] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L1269] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\n[L1270] subjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\n[L1271] antidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\n[L1272] control group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n[L1273] 33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\n[L1274] compared to the placebo group.\r\n[L1275] In some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\n[L1276] than a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\n[L1277] an antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\n[L1278] It may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\n[L1279] patch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\n[L1280] a placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\n[L1281] nicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\n[L1282] Randomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\n[L1283] subjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\n[L1284] treatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\n[L1285] the study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\n[L1286] subconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\n[L1287] group that receives the antidepressant.\r\n[L1288] It is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\n[L1289] the 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\n[L1290] control group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\n[L1291] younger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\n[L1292] making them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\n[L1293] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L1294] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L1295] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L1296] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L1297] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L1298] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L1299] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L1300] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L1301] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L1302] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L1303] one treatment.","[L1304] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>","[L1305] 200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1306] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L1307] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L1308] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L1309] An analysis9\r\n[L1310]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L1311] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L1312] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L1313] studies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L1314] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L1315] 9\r\n[L1316] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L1317] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L1318] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L1319] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L1320] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L1321] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L1322] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L1323] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L1324] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L1325] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L1326] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L1327] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L1328] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L1329] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L1330] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L1331] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L1332] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L1333] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1334] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L1335] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L1336] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L1337] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L1338] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L1339] The other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\n[L1340] study observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\n[L1341] Questions to Explore\r\n[L1342] a. Identify the response and explanatory variables, the treatments, and the \r\n[L1343] experimental units.\r\n[L1344] Example 7 ","[L1345] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 45>","[L1346] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 201\r\n[L1347] Generalizing Results to Broader Populations\r\n[L1348] We\u2019ve seen that random samples are preferable to convenience samples, yet con\ufffevenience samples are more feasible than many experiments. When an experiment \r\n[L1349] uses a convenience sample, be cautious about the extent to which results gener\ufffealize to a larger population. Look carefully at the characteristics of the sample. \r\n[L1350] Do they seem representative of the overall population? If not, the results have \r\n[L1351] dubious worth.\r\n[L1352] b. How should the researchers assign the subjects to the two treatment \r\n[L1353] groups?\r\n[L1354] c. Without knowing more about this study, what would you identify as a \r\n[L1355] potential problem with the study design?\r\n[L1356] Think It Through\r\n[L1357] a. This experiment has\r\n[L1358] Response variable: Whether the subject abstains from smoking for \r\n[L1359] one year (yes or no)\r\n[L1360] Explanatory variable: Whether the subject received bupropion (yes \r\n[L1361] or no)\r\n[L1362] Treatments: bupropion, no bupropion\r\n[L1363] Experimental units: The 429 volunteers who are the study subjects\r\n[L1364] b. The researchers should randomize to assign subjects to the two treat\ufffements. They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\n[L1365] of the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\n[L1366] to the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group). The \r\n[L1367] procedure would be as follows:\r\n[L1368] j Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\n[L1369] j Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\n[L1370] bupropion group.\r\n[L1371] j Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\n[L1372] values between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\n[L1373] will receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n[L1374]  control group.\r\n[L1375] c. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\n[L1376] whether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\n[L1377] sources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\n[L1378] abstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\n[L1379] Insight\r\n[L1380] In the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\n[L1381] year, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\n[L1382] with 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\n[L1383] were not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects. However, after \r\n[L1384] two years, the percentage of nonsmokers was similar for the two groups, 42% \r\n[L1385] versus 40%.\r\n[L1386] c Try Exercise 4.32\r\n[L1387] ,Q3UDFWLFH The Randomized \r\n[L1388] Experiment in Medicine\r\n[L1389] In medicine, the randomized \r\n[L1390] experiment (clinical trial) has become \r\n[L1391] the gold standard for evaluating new \r\n[L1392] medical treatments.

But some studies mistakenly try to generalize \r\n[L1411] to a broader population than the one from which the sample was taken. A psy\ufffechologist may conduct an experiment using a sample of students from an intro\ufffeductory psychology course.

In an experiment conducted at the Madigan Army \r\n[L1442] Medical Center in the state of Washington (Archives of \r\n[L1443] Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine 2002; 156: 971\u2013974), \r\n[L1444] 51 patients between the ages of 3 and 22 were randomly \r\n[L1445] assigned to receive either duct-tape therapy (covering \r\n[L1446] the wart with a piece of duct tape) or cryotherapy (freez\ufffeing a wart by applying a quick, narrow blast of liquid \r\n[L1447] nitrogen). After two months, the percentage successfully \r\n[L1448] treated was 85% in the duct tape group and 60% in the \r\n[L1449] cryotherapy group.\r\n[L1450]  4.3 Practicing the Basics\r\n[L1451] a.

Pediat. Adoles. \r\n[L1459] Med. 2006; 160: 1121\u20131125).\r\n[L1460] a.

The plan includes recruiting \r\n[L1475] 100 individuals suffering from moderate to severe pain to \r\n[L1476] participate. One half of the group will be assigned to take \r\n[L1477] the actual experimental drug, and the other half will be \r\n[L1478]  assigned a placebo.

Facebook users were \r\n[L1535] randomly selected to be part of two parallel studies in \r\n[L1536] which Facebook manipulated the exposure to emo\ufffetional expressions in the user\u2019s news feed. Two parallel \r\n[L1537]  experiments were conducted. In one study, it reduced \r\n[L1538] the positive emotional content; in the other study, the \r\n[L1539] negative emotional content was reduced. For\u00a0each \r\n[L1540] study, there was a control group (the users\u2019 news feed \r\n[L1541] was not manipulated), and an experimental group (the \r\n[L1542] users\u2019 news\u00a0feed was manipulated\u2014either positively or \r\n[L1543] negatively). Two variables were measured in each study \r\n[L1544] after the manipulation by Facebook: the percentage of \r\n[L1545] all words produced by a person that was positive and \r\n[L1546] the percentage of all words produced by a person that \r\n[L1547] was negative.

A team of researchers stud\ufffeied whether typing text messages, reading them, or a combi\ufffenation of both, while driving affect eye movements, stimulus \r\n[L1563] detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed \r\n[L1564] and headway significantly. A total sample of 977 participants \r\n[L1565] from 28 experimental studies was considered in the investi\ufffegation. Results show that typing and reading text messages \r\n[L1566] while driving adversely affected driver control ability. Typing \r\n[L1567] text messages alone produced similar decrements as typing \r\n[L1568] and reading, whereas reading alone had smaller decrements \r\n[L1569] over fewer dependent variables.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\n[L1585] extended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\n[L1586] alternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\n[L1587] of observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\n[L1588] with humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\n[L1589] or more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\n[L1590] Sample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\n[L1591] Designs\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\n[L1592] Simple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\n[L1593] In practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\n[L1594] or are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\n[L1595] Sometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\n[L1596] Cluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\n[L1597] frame\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\n[L1598] information is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\n[L1599] study of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\n[L1600] students can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\n[L1601] observing each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\n[L1602] For instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\n[L1603] your city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\n[L1604] city blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\n[L1605] then select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\n[L1606] Cluster Random Sample\r\n[L1607] Divide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\n[L1608] random sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\n[L1609] cluster random sample.\r\n[L1610] For personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\n[L1611] sampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\n[L1612] many observations quickly and with little travel.\r\n[L1613] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\n[L1614] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1615] Cluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\n[L1616] j A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\n[L1617] j The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\n[L1618] The disadvantages are:\r\n[L1619] j We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\n[L1620] of precision.\r\n[L1621] j Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.","[L1622] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>","[L1623] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\n[L1624] Stratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\n[L1625] number of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement. The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L1626] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L1627] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L1628] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L1629] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L1630] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L1631] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L1632] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L1633] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L1634] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L1635] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L1636] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L1637] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\n[L1638] each subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\n[L1639] in your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\n[L1640] students who work and who don\u2019t work. However, this information may not be \r\n[L1641] available for each student.\r\n[L1642] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Stratified \r\n[L1643] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1644] Stratified random sampling has the\r\n[L1645] j Advantage that you can include in your sample enough subjects in each group \r\n[L1646] (stratum) you want to evaluate.\r\n[L1647] j Disadvantage that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into \r\n[L1648] which each subject belongs.\r\n[L1649] What\u2019s the difference between a stratified sample and a cluster sample? A \r\n[L1650] stratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L1651] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L1652] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L1653] random sample).\r\n[L1654] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L1655] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L1656] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L1657] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L1658] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L1659] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L1660] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L1661] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L1662] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L1663] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L1664] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of ","[L1665] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>","[L1666] 206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1667] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L1668] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L1669] be infeasible.\r\n[L1670] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L1671] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L1672] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L1673] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L1674] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L1675] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L1676] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L1677] sampling.

With an observational study, it\u2019s possible that an association \r\n[L1714] is due to some lurking variable. However, observational studies do have advan\ufffetages. It\u2019s often not practical to conduct an experiment. For instance, with human \r\n[L1715] subjects it\u2019s not ethical to design an experiment to study the long-term effect of \r\n[L1716] cell phone use on getting cancer. Nevertheless, it is possible to design an observa\ufffetional study that controls for identified lurking variables.\r\n[L1717] Rather than taking a cross section of a population at some time, such as with \r\n[L1718] a sample survey, some studies are backward looking (retrospective) or forward \r\n[L1719] looking (prospective). Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\n[L1720] How can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\n[L1721] use and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\n[L1722] of subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\n[L1723] and then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups.

All patients were queried about \r\n[L1732] their smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\n[L1733] least one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\n[L1734] to look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\n[L1735] Table 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\n[L1736] were the patients with lung cancer.

The lung \r\n[L1757] cancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\n[L1758] Insight\r\n[L1759] An inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\n[L1760] This suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1761] c Try Exercise 4.46\r\n[L1762] Case-Control Study\r\n[L1763] A case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\n[L1764] a\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\n[L1765] outcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1766] This is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\n[L1767] ethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\n[L1768] smoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\n[L1769] potential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\n[L1770] variables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\n[L1771] and hospital.\r\n[L1772] In a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\n[L1773] fixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\n[L1774] For instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\n[L1775] time to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\n[L1776] the explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\n[L1777] or control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\n[L1778] subjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\n[L1779] half the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\n[L1780] had lung cancer.\r\n[L1781] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L1782] In Example 8, the response \r\n[L1783] outcome of interest was having lung \r\n[L1784] cancer.

In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\n[L1795] randomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\n[L1796] cases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\n[L1797] eye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\n[L1798] subjects with the cases.\r\n[L1799] Question to Explore\r\n[L1800] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L1801] such as age?\r\n[L1802] Example 9 ","[L1803] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>","[L1804] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\n[L1805] Prospective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\n[L1806] into the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\n[L1807] Think It Through\r\n[L1808] We\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\n[L1809] such as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\n[L1810] were observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\n[L1811] researchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\n[L1812] variables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\n[L1813] provides.\r\n[L1814] When researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\n[L1815] relationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\n[L1816] is not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\n[L1817] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1818] Insight\r\n[L1819] The lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\n[L1820] the two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\n[L1821] finding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\n[L1822] to be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\n[L1823] users of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\n[L1824] c Try Exercise 4.47\r\n[L1825] Prospective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\n[L1826] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1827] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\n[L1828] began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years. The purpose of \r\n[L1829] the study was to explore relationships among diet, hormonal factors, smok\ufffeing habits, and exercise habits, and the risk of coronary heart disease, pul\ufffemonary disease, and stroke. Since the initial survey in 1976, the nurses have \r\n[L1830] filled out a questionnaire every two years.\r\n[L1831] Question to Explore\r\n[L1832] What does it mean for this observational study to be called prospective?\r\n[L1833] Think It Through\r\n[L1834] The retrospective smoking study in Example 8 looked to the past to learn \r\n[L1835] whether its lung cancer subjects had been smokers. By contrast, at the start \r\n[L1836] of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\n[L1837] would eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer. The study followed \r\n[L1838] each nurse into the future to see whether she developed that outcome and \r\n[L1839] to analyze whether certain explanatory variables (such as smoking) were \r\n[L1840] associated with it.\r\n[L1841] Example 10 \r\n[L1842] 11More information on this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00005152 and at \r\n[L1843] www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs.","[L1844] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://9817beec834ef81#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":69393,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1845] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 45>","[L1846] 210 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1847] Observational Studies and Causation\r\n[L1848] Can we ever definitively establish causation with an observational study? No, we \r\n[L1849] cannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\n[L1850] was observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\n[L1851] have caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\n[L1852] smoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\n[L1853] conducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\n[L1854] time, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\n[L1855] of lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\n[L1856] retrospective and prospective, have added more evidence. For example, when a \r\n[L1857] prospective study begun in 1951 with 35,000 doctors ended in 2001, researchers12\r\n[L1858] estimated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who \r\n[L1859] never quit. This study estimated that at least half the people who smoke from \r\n[L1860] youth are eventually killed by their habit.\r\n[L1861] Most important, studies carried out on different populations of people have \r\n[L1862] consistently concluded that smoking is associated with lung cancer, even after ad\ufffejusting for all potentially confounding variables that researchers have suggested. \r\n[L1863] As more studies are done that adjust for confounding variables, the chance that a \r\n[L1864] lurking variable remains that can explain the association is reduced. As a conse\ufffequence, although we cannot definitively conclude that smoking causes lung can\ufffecer, physicians will not hesitate to tell you that they believe it does.

First, we\u2019ll learn \r\n[L1868] how a single experiment can help us analyze the effects of two explanatory vari\ufffeables at once.\r\n[L1869] Categorical explanatory variables in an experiment are often referred to as \r\n[L1870] factors.

Why not do one experiment \r\n[L1924] about bupropion and a separate experiment about the nicotine patch? The rea\ufffeson is that we can learn more from a two-factor experiment.

Medical experiments often do this to compare treat\ufffements for chronic conditions that do not have a permanent cure.\r\n[L1950] To illustrate, suppose a study plans to compare an oral drug and a placebo for \r\n[L1951] treating migraine headaches. The subjects could take one treatment the first time \r\n[L1952] they get a migraine headache and the other treatment the second time they get \r\n[L1953] a migraine headache.

We\u2019ll explore the results in Exercise 4.72. If we in\ufffecluded a third factor of whether the subject receives counseling, we would \r\n[L1979] have three factors with 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 treatments to compare.\r\n[L1980] c Try Exercise 4.50\r\n[L1981] 5HFDOO\r\n[L1982] This study is double-blind if both the \r\n[L1983] subjects and the evaluator(s) of the subjects \r\n[L1984] do not know whether the pill is active and \r\n[L1985] whether the patch is active. b\r\n[L1986] Subject Drug Placebo\r\n[L1987] 1 Relief No relief d first matched pair\r\n[L1988] 2 Relief Relief\r\n[L1989] 3 No relief No relief\r\n[L1990] For the entire sample, we would compare the percentage of subjects who have \r\n[L1991] pain relief with the drug to the percentage who have pain relief with the placebo. \r\n[L1992] The two observations for a particular subject are called a matched pair because \r\n[L1993] they both come from the same person.\r\n[L1994] A matched-pairs design in which subjects cross over during the experiment \r\n[L1995] from using one treatment to using another treatment is called a crossover design. \r\n[L1996] Crossover design helps remove certain sources of potential bias. Using the same \r\n[L1997] subjects for each treatment keeps potential lurking variables from affecting the ","[L1998] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 45>","[L1999] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 213\r\n[L2000] results because those variables take the same values for each treatment. For in\ufffestance, any difference observed between the drug and the placebo responses is \r\n[L2001] not because subjects taking the drug had better overall health. Another example \r\n[L2002] of a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\n[L2003] An additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types. In each field, two \r\n[L2004] plots are marked, one for each fertilizer. Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L2005] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L2006] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L2007] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L2008] applied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\n[L2009] can\u2019t use many fields.\r\n[L2010] Blocking in an Experiment\r\n[L2011] The matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements. The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\n[L2012] The crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\n[L2013] In experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\n[L2014] to as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\n[L2015] within blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\n[L2016] study, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\n[L2017] so they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\n[L2018] To reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\n[L2019] In the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\n[L2020] be randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\n[L2021] effect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\n[L2022] the second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\n[L2023] assigned to the plots in a field.\r\n[L2024] culprit. They were also pioneers in developing a sound theo\uffferetical basis for the case-control method. They followed their \r\n[L2025] initial study with other case-control studies and with a long-term \r\n[L2026] prospective study that showed that smoking was not only the \r\n[L2027] predominant risk factor for lung cancer but also correlated with \r\n[L2028] other diseases.\r\n[L2029] At first, Bradford Hill was cautious about claiming that \r\n[L2030] smoking causes lung cancer. As the evidence mounted from \r\n[L2031] various studies, he accepted the causal link as being overwhelm\ufffeingly the most likely explanation. An influential article written \r\n[L2032] by Bradford Hill in 1965 proposed criteria that should be sat\ufffeisfied before you conclude that an association reflects a causal \r\n[L2033] link. For his work, in 1961 Austin Bradford Hill was knighted by \r\n[L2034] Queen Elizabeth. Richard Doll was knighted in 1971.\r\n[L2035] In the mid-20th century, Austin Bradford Hill was Britain\u2019s \r\n[L2036] leading medical statistician. In 1946, to assess the effect of strep\ufffetomycin in treating pulmonary tuberculosis, he designed what is \r\n[L2037] now regarded as the first controlled randomized medical exper\ufffeiment. About that time, doctors noticed the alarming increase \r\n[L2038] in the number of lung cancer cases. The cause was unknown \r\n[L2039] but suspected to be atmospheric pollution, particularly coal \r\n[L2040] smoke.

As part of a security awareness training program, \r\n[L2070] the group overseeing implementation of the program will \r\n[L2071]  randomly choose a sample of 20 employees to begin the \r\n[L2072] training; the percentages of workers from each department \r\n[L2073] in the sample are to align with the percentages throughout \r\n[L2074] the company.\r\n[L2075] a.

The numbers of students in each of the schools \r\n[L2081] are as follows:\r\n[L2082] 455 423 399 388 348 344 308 299 297 272 266 260\r\n[L2083] 252 244 222 209 175 161 151 148 128 109 101 98\r\n[L2084] The district wants to implement an experimental teaching \r\n[L2085] and learning model for approximately 20% of the 6057 stu\ufffedents in the district. Administrators want to choose the 20% \r\n[L2086] randomly, but they will not be able to use simple random \r\n[L2087] sampling throughout the entire district because the new \r\n[L2088] model can be implemented only at an entire school, not just \r\n[L2089] for a select group of students at each school. The schools \r\n[L2090] not selected will continue to use the current teaching and \r\n[L2091] learning model.\r\n[L2092] a. Explain how one could use cluster random sampling \r\n[L2093] to achieve the goal of choosing approximately 20% \r\n[L2094] of the students in the district for the experimental \r\n[L2095] model.\r\n[L2096] b. Use cluster random sampling and an app or software \r\n[L2097] to determine which schools will be randomly selected \r\n[L2098] to use the new model. How many schools are in your \r\n[L2099] sample?

The sports website ESPN.com asked visitors \r\n[L2289] of the site which team would win the Southeast region. \r\n[L2290] CHAPTER SUMMARY \r\n[L2291] This chapter introduced methods for gathering data.\r\n[L2292] j An experiment assigns subjects to experimental conditions (such \r\n[L2293] as drug or placebo) called treatments. These are categories of \r\n[L2294] the explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\n[L2295] is then observed for each subject.\r\n[L2296] j An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\n[L2297] that observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\n[L2298] observes rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\n[L2299] Since association does not imply causation, with observational \r\n[L2300] studies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\n[L2301] influence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\n[L2302] randomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\n[L2303] to the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\n[L2304] variables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\n[L2305] causation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\n[L2306] with neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\n[L2307] treatment a subject was assigned.\r\n[L2308] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\n[L2309] a sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\n[L2310] incorporate random sampling.\r\n[L2311] j A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\n[L2312] in which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\n[L2313] being selected.\r\n[L2314] j A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\n[L2315] clusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\n[L2316] as the sample.\r\n[L2317] j A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\n[L2318] groups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\n[L2319] from each stratum.\r\n[L2320] Be cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\n[L2321] such as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\n[L2322] random sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\n[L2323] nonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\n[L2324] are biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\n[L2325] Most sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\n[L2326] with many experiments. Medical studies often use retrospective\r\n[L2327] observational studies, which look at subjects\u2019 behavior in the past.\r\n[L2328] j A case-control study is an example of a retrospective study. \r\n[L2329] Subjects who have a response outcome of interest, such as \r\n[L2330] cancer, serve as cases. Other subjects not having that outcome \r\n[L2331] serve as controls. The cases and controls are compared on an \r\n[L2332] explanatory variable, such as whether they had been smokers.\r\n[L2333] A categorical explanatory variable in an experiment is also called a \r\n[L2334] factor. Multifactor experiments have at least two explanatory vari\ufffeables. With a completely randomized design, subjects are assigned \r\n[L2335] randomly to categories of each explanatory variable. Some designs \r\n[L2336] instead use blocks\u2014sets of experimental units that are matched. \r\n[L2337] Matched-pairs designs have two observations in each block. Often \r\n[L2338] this is the same subject observed for each of two treatments, such as \r\n[L2339] in a crossover study.\r\n[L2340] Data are only as good as the method used to obtain them. \r\n[L2341] Unless we use a good study design, conclusions may be faulty.","[L2342] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 45>","[L2343] Chapter Problems 217\r\n[L2344] c.

Data also suggest \r\n[L2636] that individuals who smoke marijuana are twice as likely \r\n[L2637] to develop schizophrenia as those who do not use the drug. \r\n[L2638] Contributing to the apparent relationship, a comprehen\ufffesive review done in 2007 of the existing research reported \r\n[L2639] that individuals who merely try marijuana increase their \r\n[L2640] risk of developing schizophrenia by 40%. Meanwhile, the \r\n[L2641] percentage of the population who has tried marijuana \r\n[L2642] has increased dramatically in the United States over the \r\n[L2643] past 50 years, whereas the percentage of the population \r\n[L2644] affected by schizophrenia has remained constant at about \r\n[L2645] 1%.

For instance, the quota might \r\n[L2656] be 50 factory workers, 100 housewives, 60 elderly people, \r\n[L2657] 30 Hispanics, and so forth. This is called quota sampling. \r\n[L2658] Is this a random sampling method? Explain and discuss \r\n[L2659] potential advantages or disadvantages of this method. \r\n[L2660] (The Gallup organization used quota sampling until it \r\n[L2661] predicted, incorrectly, that Dewey would easily defeat \r\n[L2662] Truman in the 1948 presidential election.)\r\n[L2663] 4.90 Smoking and heart attacks A Reuters story (April 2, 2003) \r\n[L2664] reported that \u201cThe number of heart attack victims fell by \r\n[L2665] almost 60% at one hospital six months after a smoke-free \r\n[L2666] ordinance went into effect in the area (Helena, Montana), \r\n[L2667] a study showed, reinforcing concerns about second-hand \r\n[L2668] smoke.\u201d The number of hospital admissions for heart attack \r\n[L2669] dropped from just under seven per month to four a month \r\n[L2670] during the six months after the smoking ban.\r\n[L2671] a.

In the context of this study, describe how you could \r\n[L2673]  explain to someone who has never studied statistics that \r\n[L2674] association does not imply causation. For instance, give \r\n[L2675] a potential reason that could explain this association.\r\n[L2676] 4.91 Issues in clinical trials A randomized clinical trial is \r\n[L2677] planned for AIDS patients to investigate whether a new \r\n[L2678] treatment provides improved survival over the current \r\n[L2679] standard treatment. It is not known whether it will be \r\n[L2680] better or worse.\r\n[L2681] a. Why do researchers use randomization in such \r\n[L2682]  experiments rather than letting the subjects choose \r\n[L2683] which treatment they will receive?\r\n[L2684] b. When patients enrolling in the study are told the \r\n[L2685]  purpose of the study, explain why they may be reluc\ufffetant to be randomly assigned to one of the treatments.\r\n[L2686] c.

A vaccine is claimed to be \r\n[L2696]  effective in preventing a rare disease that occurs in about \r\n[L2697] one of every 100,000 people. Explain why a randomized \r\n[L2698] clinical trial comparing 100 people who get the vaccine \r\n[L2699] to 100 people who do not get it is unlikely to be worth \r\n[L2700] doing.

A congresswoman reports that letters to her office are \r\n[L2717] running 3 to 1 in opposition to the passage of stricter \r\n[L2718] gun control laws.

An anthropology professor wants to compare attitudes \r\n[L2721] toward premarital sex of physical science majors and \r\n[L2722] social science majors. She administers a question\ufffenaire to her Anthropology 437, Comparative Human \r\n[L2723] Sexuality class. She finds no appreciable difference in \r\n[L2724] attitudes between the two majors, so she concludes \r\n[L2725] that the two student groups are about the same in their \r\n[L2726] views about premarital sex.\r\n[L2727] d.

She lists all \r\n[L2738] of the first-period classes. Then, using a random num\ufffeber table, she chooses a class at random and interviews \r\n[L2739] every student in that class about the proposed test.\r\n[L2740] b. A new restaurant opened in January. In June, after \r\n[L2741] six months of operation, the owner applied for a loan \r\n[L2742] to improve the building. The loan application asked \r\n[L2743] for the annual gross income of the business. The \r\n[L2744] owner\u2019s record book contains receipts for each day \r\n[L2745] of operation since opening.

Each infant in the study was shown two \r\n[L2813] videos. One video included a figure performing a help\ufffeing action and the other included a figure performing a \r\n[L2814] hindering action. Infants were presented with two toys \r\n[L2815] resembling the helping and hindering figures from the \r\n[L2816] videos and allowed to choose one of the toys to play with. \r\n[L2817] The researchers conjectured that, even at a very young \r\n[L2818] age, the infants would tend to choose the helpful object.\r\n[L2819] a.

In fact, of the 16 babies \r\n[L2827] in the study, half were shown the videos in one order \r\n[L2828] while the other half was shown the videos in the opposite \r\n[L2829]  order.

Is this \r\n[L2835] convincing evidence that infants tend to prefer the helpful \r\n[L2836] figure? Use the Random Numbers web app on the book\u2019s \r\n[L2837] website to investigate the approximate likelihood of the \r\n[L2838] observed results of 14 out of 16 infants choosing the help\ufffeful figure, if in fact infants are indifferent between the two \r\n[L2839] figures.

(Hint: When you sample \r\n[L2880] individuals, explain why you are more likely to sample \r\n[L2881] a large family than a small family.

Capture\u2013 \r\n[L2888] recapture is one method for doing this. A biologist \r\n[L2889] wants to count the deer population in a certain region. \r\n[L2890] She captures 50 deer, tags each, and then releases them. \r\n[L2891] Several weeks later, she captures 125 deer and finds \r\n[L2892] that 12 of them were tagged. Let N = population size,\r\n[L2893] M = size of first sample, n = size of second sample, \r\n[L2894] R = number tagged in second sample.

It states that \u201cresearch \r\n[L2905] for the Bar found that over 40 percent of female junior \r\n[L2906] tenants said they had encountered sexual harassment \r\n[L2907] during their time at the Bar.\u201d This was based on a study \r\n[L2908] conducted at the University of Sheffield that sent a \r\n[L2909] questionnaire to 334 junior tenants at the Bar, of whom \r\n[L2910] 159 responded. Of the 159, 67 were female. Of those \r\n[L2911] females, 3 said they had experienced sexual harassment \r\n[L2912] as a major problem, and 24 had experienced it as a slight \r\n[L2913] problem.\r\n[L2914] a. The quoted statement might be misleading because \r\n[L2915] the nonresponse was large.\r\n[L2916] b. No one was forced to respond, so everyone had a \r\n[L2917] chance to be in the sample, which implies it was a \r\n[L2918] simple random sample.\r\n[L2919] c. This was an example of a completely randomized \r\n[L2920]  experiment, with whether a female junior tenant \r\n[L2921]  experienced sexual harassment as the response \r\n[L2922] variable.\r\n[L2923] d. This was a retrospective case-control study, with those \r\n[L2924] who received sexual harassment as the cases.\r\n[L2925] 4.103 Multiple choice: Effect of response categories A study \r\n[L2926] (N.

When the possible \r\n[L2929] responses were the six categories (up to 1\r\n[L2930] 2 hour, 1\r\n[L2931] 2 to 1 hour, \r\n[L2932] 1 to 11\r\n[L2933] 2 hours, . . . , more than 21\r\n[L2934] 2 hours), 16% of respondents \r\n[L2935] said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2936] 2 hours per day. When the \r\n[L2937] six categories were (up to 21\r\n[L2938] 2 hours, 21\r\n[L2939] 2 to 3 hours, . . . , more \r\n[L2940] than 4 hours), 38% said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2941] 2 hours \r\n[L2942] per day.\r\n[L2943] a. The samples could not have been random, or this \r\n[L2944] would not have happened.\r\n[L2945] b. This shows the importance of question design, especially \r\n[L2946] when people may be uncertain what the answer to the \r\n[L2947] question really is.\r\n[L2948] c.

She selects \r\n[L2952] subjects by picking one of the first 100 on the list at ran\ufffedom, skipping 100 names to get the next subject, skipping \r\n[L2953] another 100 names to get the next subject, and so on. \r\n[L2954] This is called a systematic random sample.\r\n[L2955] a. With simple random sampling, (i) every subject is equally \r\n[L2956] likely to be chosen, and (ii) every possible sample of size \r\n[L2957] n is equally likely. Indicate which, if any, of (i) and (ii) \r\n[L2958] are true for systematic random samples. Explain.\r\n[L2959] In First Sample?\r\n[L2960] Yes (tagged) No (not tagged) Total\r\n[L2961] In Second Yes R n\r\n[L2962] Sample? No\r\n[L2963] Total M N\r\n[L2964] a. Identify the values of M, n, and R for the biologist\u2019s \r\n[L2965] experiment.\r\n[L2966] b. One way to estimate N lets the sample proportion of \r\n[L2967] tagged deer equal the population proportion of tagged \r\n[L2968] deer. Explain why this means that\r\n[L2969] R\r\n[L2970] n = M\r\n[L2971] N\r\n[L2972] and, hence, that the estimated population size is \r\n[L2973] N = 1M * n2 >R\r\n[L2974] c. Estimate the number of deer in the deer population \r\n[L2975] using the numbers given.\r\n[L2976] d. The U.S. Bureau of the Census uses capture\u2013recapture \r\n[L2977] to make adjustments to the census by estimating the \r\n[L2978] undercount. The capture phase is the census itself \r\n[L2979] (persons are \u201ctagged\u201d by having returned their census \r\n[L2980] form and being recorded as counted), and the recap\ufffeture phase (the second sample) is the postenumerative \r\n[L2981] survey (PES) conducted after the census.

A particular value of center is \r\n[L3007] the mean area of the states. A map and a list of the states \r\n[L3008] with their areas (in square miles) are shown in the figure \r\n[L3009] and table that follow. Area for a state includes dry land \r\n[L3010] and permanent inland water surface.\r\n[L3011] Although we could use these data to calculate the actual \r\n[L3012] mean area, let\u2019s explore how well sampling performs \r\n[L3013] in estimating the mean area by sampling five states and \r\n[L3014] finding the sample mean.\r\n[L3015] a. The most convenient sampling design is to use our \r\n[L3016] eyes to pick five states from the map that we think \r\n[L3017] have areas representative of all the states. Do this, \r\n[L3018] picking five states that you believe have areas rep\uffferesentative of the actual mean area of the states. \r\n[L3019] Compute their sample mean area.\r\n[L3020] b.

The true mean total land area for the 48 states can \r\n[L3034] be calculated from the accompanying table by divid\ufffeing the total at the bottom of the table by 48.

sample = the 300 students you actually measure. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L133-L140\ue201  \n- **Response variable vs explanatory variable.** The **response variable** is the outcome you care about; the **explanatory variable** is what might influence it. **Example:** Response = exam score; explanatory = app use (yes/no, or hours). \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L137-L140\ue201  \n- **Experimental study (experiment) and \u201ctreatments.\u201d** An experiment **assigns** subjects to experimental conditions (\u201ctreatments\u201d) and observes the response. **Example:** Randomly assign students to \u201cstudy app\u201d vs \u201cno app,\u201d then compare exam scores. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L141-L160\ue201  \n- **Observational study (nonexperimental).** An observational study measures response/explanatory variables **without imposing** treatments. **Example:** Survey students at the end of term: who used the app and what score they got. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L169-L176\ue201  \n- **Causation: experiments are stronger; observational studies can\u2019t establish cause definitively.** Observational associations may be driven by **lurking variables** (unmeasured variables that distort the relationship). The text explicitly reminds: **association does not imply causation**. **Example:** App-users may already be more conscientious; conscientiousness (lurking variable) could explain higher scores. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L293-L305\ue201  \n- **Why random assignment helps (balancing lurking variables).** Randomly assigning treatments aims to create groups with similar distributions on other factors, reducing the role of lurking variables. **Example:** Random assignment makes it less likely that \u201chighly motivated students\u201d all end up in the app group. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L273-L287\ue201  \n- **Why experiments aren\u2019t always feasible (ethics, compliance, time).** Long-term harmful exposures may be unethical; enforcing treatment adherence can be impractical; and waiting decades is unrealistic\u2014so researchers often resort to observational studies. **Example:** You can\u2019t ethically force one group of students to \u201cnever study\u201d for years to test whether studying causes better outcomes. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L330-L359\ue201  \n- **Anecdotal evidence is not reliable evidence about a population.** Personal stories aren\u2019t guaranteed representative (\u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d). **Example:** \u201cMy friend used the app and aced the exam\u201d is not strong evidence the app works for most students. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L364-L377\ue201  \n- **Sample surveys vs censuses.** A **sample survey** takes a sample and collects data (still nonexperimental); a **census** tries to measure everyone, but is often impractical in reality. **Example:** Survey 1,000 students (sample survey) vs forcing all 20,000 students to respond (census-like). \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L402-L410\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\n\n- **Start by defining the population.** The first step of a survey is to specify exactly who the results should describe. **Example:** \u201cAll students enrolled in Calculus I this semester\u201d (not \u201cstudents who happen to be in the library\u201d). \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L620-L628\ue201  \n- **Sampling frame vs sampling design.** The **sampling frame** is the list you sample from; the **sampling design** is how you pick people from that list. A poor design (like selecting your own class) can be unrepresentative. **Example:** Frame = registrar\u2019s roster of Calculus I students; bad design = sample only your tutorial section. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L629-L652\ue201  \n- **Simple random sample (gold standard baseline).** A **simple random sample of size n** means every possible sample of size n has the same chance of selection. **Example:** Randomly select 300 student IDs from the roster using a random-number generator. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L655-L666\ue201  \n- **How random sampling is implemented.** Number the sampling frame, generate random numbers, and select corresponding subjects. **Example:** Label students 1\u20265000; generate 300 unique random integers; pick those students. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L702-L707\ue201  \n\n### Key pitfalls (biases) in sampling\n\n- **Sampling bias (including undercoverage).** Happens when the sampling method is nonrandom or the sampling frame misses parts of the population. **Example:** If you sample only students with campus housing emails, you under-cover commuters and may bias results. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L835-L844\ue201  \n- **Nonresponse bias.** Occurs when selected subjects can\u2019t be reached or refuse; responders may systematically differ. **Example:** If only highly engaged students respond to your survey, you may overestimate app effectiveness. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L845-L855\ue201  \n- **Response bias (question wording / dishonesty / interviewer effects).** Responses can be distorted by confusing/leading questions or social desirability. **Example:** Asking \u201cDo you responsibly use the app every day?\u201d will likely inflate \u201cyes\u201d responses compared with a neutral wording. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L867-L880\ue201  \n- **Convenience samples and volunteer samples are risky.** Convenience samples are \u201ceasy to get\u201d but often unrepresentative; volunteer samples (common online) can be especially biased. **Example:** An online poll on the app\u2019s homepage will over-sample app enthusiasts. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L930-L954\ue201  \n- **Large sample size does NOT fix biased sampling.** A huge sample can still be wrong if it\u2019s systematically unrepresentative; the Literary Digest poll is used to illustrate this. **Example:** Surveying 10,000 library regulars about grades still biases upward compared with a smaller true random sample of 500 students. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1011-L1023\ue201  \n- **Summary \u201cgood survey\u201d checklist.** Identify population, define sampling frame, use random sampling via random numbers, and remain alert to sampling/response/nonresponse bias. **Example:** A clean design: roster-based random sample + neutral wording + follow-up reminders for nonresponders. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1024-L1032\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment\n\n- **Core experiment logic.** Assign treatments, observe response, study how treatment affects response; experiments give stronger evidence for causation than nonexperimental studies. **Example:** Assign app vs no-app, then compare exam scores. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1220-L1226\ue201  \n- **\u201cExperimental units.\u201d** The objects receiving treatments (often people, but not necessarily). **Example:** Units could be students, entire tutorial groups, or even schools. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1227-L1229\ue201  \n- **Control group is essential.** You need a comparison condition to interpret outcomes. **Example:** Without a no-app control group, you can\u2019t tell whether high scores are just the usual performance that term. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1253-L1262\ue201  \n- **Placebo and the placebo effect.** A **placebo** is an inactive look-alike treatment; people can improve even with placebo (the \u201cplacebo effect\u201d), so what you use as control matters. **Example:** Give the control group a \u201csham app\u201d (same interface, no study features) to separate \u201cexpectation effects\u201d from real app effects. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1257-L1274\ue201  \n- **Randomization in assignment prevents bias and balances lurking variables.** Random assignment reduces the chance that groups differ systematically (e.g., health/age/motivation). **Example:** Randomly assign students rather than letting keen students choose the app group. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1282-L1293\ue201  \n- **Why \u201cI\u2019ll balance groups by judgment\u201d is unreliable.** You can\u2019t reliably balance on all relevant variables, and you may miss key lurking variables. **Example:** Even if you match on prior grade, you might miss differences in time available to study. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1295-L1303\ue201  \n- **Well-controlled randomized experiments are less prone to \u201coverly optimistic\u201d results.** The text notes comparisons where weakly controlled studies report benefits much more often than well-controlled ones. **Example:** If you don\u2019t randomize, you might \u201cdiscover\u201d benefits that disappear under proper random assignment. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1306-L1314\ue201  \n- **Blinding (especially double-blind) reduces biased handling/measurement.** **Double-blind** means neither participants nor people interacting with/assessing them know treatment assignment. **Example:** Students might not be fully blind in education studies, but graders can be blinded to who used the app to avoid leniency bias. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1323-L1331\ue201  \n- **Generalizability warning for convenience samples.** Experiments often use volunteers; conclusions may not generalize broadly if the sample is unrepresentative. **Example:** If only highly motivated volunteers join the app trial, you should be cautious about claiming the app helps all students. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1347-L1351\ue201  \n- **What \u201cgood experiment\u201d means here (summary).** Control comparison group, randomization, blinding, and replication to build confidence. **Example:** Run the app trial again next semester to see if results replicate. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1416-L1427\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and Nonexperimental Studies\n\n- **Why this section exists: real studies often use stronger variants of \u201csimple random sample\u201d and \u201csimple experiment.\u201d** It introduces practical sampling designs, observational designs for questions where experiments aren\u2019t feasible, and experiments with multiple explanatory variables. **Example:** One study can test both \u201capp use\u201d and \u201ctutoring\u201d at once. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1583-L1589\ue201  \n\n### Sample surveys: beyond simple random sampling\n\n- **Cluster random sampling.** Randomly select clusters (preexisting groups) and include subjects within selected clusters; useful when a complete sampling frame is hard or costly. **Example:** Randomly select 10 Calculus tutorial groups (clusters) and survey all students in those groups. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1596-L1609\ue201  \n  - **Tradeoff:** cheaper/easier logistics, but can require larger sample sizes and can be less diverse if few clusters are chosen. **Example:** If you pick only morning tutorials, you may accidentally miss patterns in evening students. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1613-L1621\ue201  \n- **Stratified random sampling.** Split population into strata (subgroups) and sample randomly within each stratum; helps ensure enough data in each subgroup. **Example:** Sample 50 students from each year level (freshman/sophomore/junior/senior) to compare app effects across years. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1624-L1636\ue201  \n  - **Tradeoff:** needs stratum info for everyone in the sampling frame. **Example:** If you don\u2019t know who is a working student in your roster, you can\u2019t stratify on \u201chas job.\u201d \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1637-L1641\ue201  \n- **Cluster vs stratified (conceptual difference).** Stratified uses *all* strata and samples within each; cluster samples *some* clusters and takes everyone (or many) inside selected clusters. **Example:** Stratify by major and sample within each major vs cluster by tutorial group and include whole selected groups. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1649-L1653\ue201  \n- **Multi-stage designs are common in large surveys.** Combine stages (e.g., sample clusters, then sample within them). **Example:** Randomly select tutorial groups, then randomly sample 15 students within each selected group. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1662-L1673\ue201  \n\n### Observational studies: designs that go beyond \u201cone-time survey\u201d\n\n- **Retrospective vs prospective observational studies.** Retrospective looks backward; prospective follows subjects forward. **Example:** Retrospective: after finals, look back at app usage; prospective: enroll students at semester start and track app usage and later exam scores. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1717-L1719\ue201  \n- **Case-control study (a key retrospective design).** Compare \u201ccases\u201d (have outcome) vs \u201ccontrols\u201d (don\u2019t) on an explanatory variable; common when experiments are impractical/unethical. **Example:** Cases = students who failed; controls = students who passed; compare how often they used the app. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1762-L1766\ue201  \n  - **Important limitation:** because the numbers of cases/controls are fixed by design, you generally can\u2019t estimate population prevalence from the case-control sample itself. **Example:** If you deliberately sample 50 failers and 50 passers, you can\u2019t conclude \u201c50% of students fail.\u201d \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1772-L1780\ue201  \n- **Matching in case-control studies reduces lurking-variable distortion.** When randomization isn\u2019t possible, matching cases/controls on key variables is an attempt to achieve balance. **Example:** Match failing students to passing students with similar prior GPA and similar course section before comparing app usage. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1808-L1813\ue201  \n- **Causation and observational evidence: still not definitive, but confidence can build across many studies.** The text emphasizes you can\u2019t prove causation definitively via observational data, but consistent evidence across diverse studies (and adjustment for confounding variables) can make alternative explanations less plausible. **Example:** If multiple cohorts and case-control studies, across universities, keep finding app use predicts higher scores even after controlling for motivation proxies, confidence increases. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1847-L1865\ue201  \n\n### Experiments: richer designs than \u201cone factor, two groups\u201d\n\n- **Factors and multifactor experiments.** A **factor** is a categorical explanatory variable; multifactor experiments study two or more factors simultaneously via combined treatment groups. **Example:** Factor A = app vs no app; Factor B = tutoring vs no tutoring \u2192 4 treatment groups (app+tutoring, app-only, tutoring-only, neither). \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1866-L1901\ue201  \n- **Matched pairs and crossover designs.** Matched pairs compare two treatments within the same unit; a **crossover design** is matched pairs where subjects switch treatments over time. This reduces confounding because each subject serves as their own control. **Example:** Each student uses the app for Unit 1 and the sham app for Unit 2, with the order randomized. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L1990-L2002\ue201  \n- **Blocking and randomized block designs.** A **block** is a set of similar experimental units; you randomize treatments *within* blocks to compare on a more level playing field. **Example:** Block students by prior GPA band (low/medium/high), then randomize app vs no-app within each band. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L2013-L2017\ue201  \n- **Randomize within blocks / watch for carry-over effects in crossover studies.** Order can bias results if earlier treatment affects later outcomes (carry-over). **Example:** If the app teaches lasting study habits, using it first could boost performance even in the later \u201cno app\u201d phase\u2014so randomize the order and/or add a washout period. \ue200filecite\ue202turn8file0\ue202L2018-L2023\ue201  \n\n--- \n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a one-page \u201ccheat sheet\u201d for students (definitions + one-line warnings + the running example mapped to each design)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":383,"end_ix":411,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Design_of_experiments.pdf","id":"file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19","source":"my_files","text":"Quality study design and \ncollecting quality data ","extra":{"retrieval_turn":8,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":44,"cited_message_id":"36af3157-0591-4f4a-9bdf-6e4fb8f0c954","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":[3,21],"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":779,"end_ix":810,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Design_of_experiments.pdf","id":"file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19","source":"my_files","text":"Chapters 2 and 3 introduced graphical and numerical ways of describing data.

The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L3] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L4] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L5] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L6] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L7] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L8] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L9] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L10] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L11] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L12] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L13] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L14] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L15] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L16] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L17] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L18] would like to quit.\r\n[L19] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L20] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L21] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L22] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L23]  You need \r\n[L24] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L25] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L26] 8\r\n[L27] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L28] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L29] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L30] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L31] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L32] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L33] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L34] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L35] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L36] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L37] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L38] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L39] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L40] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L41] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L42] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L43] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L44] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L45] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse.\n# \u30101\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn9file1\ue201\nMclick Target: \"9:1\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Poor Ways to Sample\r\n[L2] How the sample is obtained can also result in bias. Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L3] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L4] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L5] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L6] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L7] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L8] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L9] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L10] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L11] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L12] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L13] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L14] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L15] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L16] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L17] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L18] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L19] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L20] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L21] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L22] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L23] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L24] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L25] than the general population.\r\n[L26] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L27] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L28] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L29] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L30] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L31] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L32] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L33] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L34] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L35] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L36] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L37] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L38] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L39] and Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\n[L40] because they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\n[L41] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L42] planned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n[L43] 2.3 million people returned the questionnaire.\n# \u30102\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn9file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"9:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] For these and other statistical \r\n[L2] analyses to be useful, we must have \u201cgood data.\u201d But what\u2019s the best way to \r\n[L3] gather data to ensure they are \u201cgood\u201d? The studies described in Example 1 used \r\n[L4] two methods. The first two studies merely observed subjects, whereas the third \r\n[L5] study conducted an experiment with them. We\u2019ll now learn about such methods, \r\n[L6] study their pros and cons, and see both good and bad ways to use them. This will \r\n[L7] help us understand when we can trust the conclusions of a study and when we \r\n[L8] need to be skeptical.\r\n[L9] 2. Is the study ethically feasible?\r\n[L10] 3. How can you design the study \r\n[L11] to be efficient?\r\n[L12] 4. What types of biases or lurking \r\n[L13] variables might exist?\r\n[L14] Thinking Ahead\r\n[L15] A knowledge of different study de\ufffesigns for gathering data helps us un\ufffederstand how contradictory results \r\n[L16] can happen in scientific research \r\n[L17] studies and determine which studies \r\n[L18] deserve our trust. In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L19] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L20] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L21] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L22] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L23] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L24] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L25] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L26] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L27] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L28] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L29] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L30] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L31] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L32] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L33] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L34] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L35] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L36] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L37] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L38] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L39] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L40] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L41] 5HFDOO\r\n[L42] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L43] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L44] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L45] we call the sample.\r\n[L46] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L47] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L48] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L49] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L50] variable. b\r\n[L51] Experimental Study\r\n[L52] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L53] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L54] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L55] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L56] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L57] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L58] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\n[L59] the experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\n[L60] response variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\n[L61] it increased.\n# \u30103\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn9file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"9:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Sometimes we can use an alternative experimental design in which each treatment \r\n[L2] is observed for each subject. Medical experiments often do this to compare treat\ufffements for chronic conditions that do not have a permanent cure.\r\n[L3] To illustrate, suppose a study plans to compare an oral drug and a placebo for \r\n[L4] treating migraine headaches. The subjects could take one treatment the first time \r\n[L5] they get a migraine headache and the other treatment the second time they get \r\n[L6] a migraine headache. The response is whether the subject\u2019s pain is relieved.

Question A three-factor design \r\n[L29] could also incorporate whether a subject receives counseling to discourage smoking. \r\n[L30] What would such a diagram look like?\r\n[L31] with a nicotine patch. We\u2019ll explore the results in Exercise 4.72. If we in\ufffecluded a third factor of whether the subject receives counseling, we would \r\n[L32] have three factors with 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 treatments to compare.\r\n[L33] c Try Exercise 4.50\r\n[L34] 5HFDOO\r\n[L35] This study is double-blind if both the \r\n[L36] subjects and the evaluator(s) of the subjects \r\n[L37] do not know whether the pill is active and \r\n[L38] whether the patch is active. b\r\n[L39] Subject Drug Placebo\r\n[L40] 1 Relief No relief d first matched pair\r\n[L41] 2 Relief Relief\r\n[L42] 3 No relief No relief\r\n[L43] For the entire sample, we would compare the percentage of subjects who have \r\n[L44] pain relief with the drug to the percentage who have pain relief with the placebo. \r\n[L45] The two observations for a particular subject are called a matched pair because \r\n[L46] they both come from the same person.\r\n[L47] A matched-pairs design in which subjects cross over during the experiment \r\n[L48] from using one treatment to using another treatment is called a crossover design. \r\n[L49] Crossover design helps remove certain sources of potential bias. Using the same \r\n[L50] subjects for each treatment keeps potential lurking variables from affecting the <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 45>Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 213\r\n[L51] results because those variables take the same values for each treatment. For in\ufffestance, any difference observed between the drug and the placebo responses is \r\n[L52] not because subjects taking the drug had better overall health. Another example \r\n[L53] of a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\n[L54] An additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types. In each field, two \r\n[L55] plots are marked, one for each fertilizer. Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L56] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L57] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L58] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L59] applied to fields that have better soil.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\n[L9] extended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\n[L10] alternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\n[L11] of observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\n[L12] with humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\n[L13] or more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\n[L14] Sample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\n[L15] Designs\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\n[L16] Simple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\n[L17] In practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\n[L18] or are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\n[L19] Sometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\n[L20] Cluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\n[L21] frame\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\n[L22] information is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\n[L23] study of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\n[L24] students can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\n[L25] observing each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\n[L26] For instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\n[L27] your city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\n[L28] city blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\n[L29] then select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\n[L30] Cluster Random Sample\r\n[L31] Divide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\n[L32] random sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\n[L33] cluster random sample.\r\n[L34] For personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\n[L35] sampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\n[L36] many observations quickly and with little travel.\r\n[L37] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\n[L38] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L39] Cluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\n[L40] j A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\n[L41] j The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\n[L42] The disadvantages are:\r\n[L43] j We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\n[L44] of precision.\r\n[L45] j Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\n[L46] Stratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\n[L47] number of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement.

Cell \r\n[L42] phones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\n[L43] main source of this energy. The closer \r\n[L44] the antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\n[L45] greater the exposure to radiation. \r\n[L46] With the increased use of cell phones, \r\n[L47] there has been a growing concern \r\n[L48] over the potential health risks. Several \r\n[L49] studies have explored the possibility \r\n[L50] of such risks:\r\n[L51] Study 1 A German study (Stang \r\n[L52] et\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\n[L53] with a rare form of eye cancer called \r\n[L54] uveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n[L55]  patients who did not have this eye \r\n[L56] cancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\n[L57] was measured using a questionnaire. \r\n[L58] On average, the eye cancer patients \r\n[L59] used cell phones more often.\r\n[L60] Study 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\n[L61] et al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\n[L62] with brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\n[L63] without brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\n[L64] cell phone use was measured using a \r\n[L65] questionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\n[L66] two groups was similar.\r\n[L67] Study 3 A study published in The \r\n[L68] Journal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\n[L69] that cell phone use speeds up activity \r\n[L70] in the brain. As part of a randomized \r\n[L71] crossover study, 47 participants were \r\n[L72] fitted with a cell phone device on each \r\n[L73] ear and then underwent two positron \r\n[L74] emission topography, or PET, scans \r\n[L75] to measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\n[L76] During one scan, the cell phones were \r\n[L77] both turned off. During the other \r\n[L78] scan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\n[L79] call was made to the phone on the \r\n[L80] right ear. The order of when the call \r\n[L81] was received (for the first or second \r\n[L82] scan) was randomized. Comparison \r\n[L83] of the PET scans showed a significant \r\n[L84] increase in activity in the part of the \r\n[L85] brain closest to the antenna during \r\n[L86] the transmission of the automated \r\n[L87] call.\r\n[L88] Studies 1 and 3 found potential \r\n[L89] physiological responses to cell \r\n[L90] phone use.

The studies described in Example 1 used \r\n[L109] two methods. The first two studies merely observed subjects, whereas the third \r\n[L110] study conducted an experiment with them. We\u2019ll now learn about such methods, \r\n[L111] study their pros and cons, and see both good and bad ways to use them.

In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L124] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L125] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L126] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L127] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L128] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L129] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L130] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L131] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L132] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L133] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L134] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L135] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L136] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L137] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L138] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L139] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L140] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L141] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L142] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L143] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L144] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L145] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L146] 5HFDOO\r\n[L147] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L148] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L149] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L150] we call the sample.\r\n[L151] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L152] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L153] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L154] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L155] variable. b\r\n[L156] Experimental Study\r\n[L157] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L158] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L159] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L160] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L161] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L162] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories ","[L163] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>","[L164] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L165] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\n[L166] the experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\n[L167] response variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\n[L168] it increased.\r\n[L169] An experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\n[L170] in the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\n[L171] By contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\n[L172] and the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\n[L173] them. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\n[L174] Observational Study\r\n[L175] In an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\n[L176] explanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\n[L177] In short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\n[L178] the study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\n[L179] treatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\n[L180] Identifying experimental \r\n[L181] versus observational \r\n[L182] studies\r\n[L183] b\r\n[L184] Cell Phone Use\r\n[L185] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L186] Example 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\n[L187] between cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body. We\u2019ve \r\n[L188] seen that Study 3 was an experiment. Studies 1 and 2 both examined the \r\n[L189] amount of cell phone use for cancer patients and for noncancer patients us\ufffeing a questionnaire.\r\n[L190] Questions to Explore\r\n[L191] a. Were Studies 1 and 2 experimental or observational studies?\r\n[L192] b. How were Studies 1 and 2 fundamentally different from Study 3 in \r\n[L193] terms of how the treatments were determined for each subject?\r\n[L194] Think It Through\r\n[L195] a. In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\n[L196] gathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\n[L197] determined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\n[L198] observed this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\n[L199] and 2 were observational studies.\r\n[L200] b. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\n[L201] the subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\n[L202] to both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\n[L203] during the second scan. The researchers imposed the treatments on \r\n[L204] the subjects. So, Study 3 was an experimental study.*\r\n[L205] Example 2 \r\n[L206] *The researchers noted that \u201cResults of this study provide evidence that acute cell phone expo\ufffesure affects brain metabolic activity.

This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\n[L261] association.\r\n[L262] Advantage of Experiments Over \r\n[L263] Observational\u00a0Studies\r\n[L264] In an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\n[L265] Example 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\n[L266] there could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\n[L267] cancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\n[L268] who do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\n[L269] a possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\n[L270] phones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\n[L271] screens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\n[L272] eye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\n[L273] By contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\n[L274] the results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\n[L275] which subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\n[L276] groups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\n[L277] similar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\n[L278] to have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\n[L279] condition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\n[L280] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L281] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L282] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L283] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L284] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L285] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L286] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L287] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L288] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L289] differences, on the average.\r\n[L290] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L291] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L292] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L293] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L294] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L295] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L296] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L297] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L298] imply causation.\r\n[L299] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L300] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L301] with an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\n[L302] which treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\n[L303] explanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\n[L304] discovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\n[L305] conduct an experiment.\r\n[L306] 5HFDOO\r\n[L307] From Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\n[L308] a variable not observed in the study that \r\n[L309] influences the association between the \r\n[L310] response and explanatory variables due \r\n[L311] to its own association with each of those \r\n[L312] variables. b\r\n[L313] &DXWLRQ\r\n[L314] In Example 3, the problem with the \r\n[L315] conclusion they made is that schools with \r\n[L316] high rates of drug use might be more \r\n[L317] inclined to employ drug tests to address \r\n[L318] the problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\n[L319] tests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n[L320] 0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\n[L321] also conceivable that drug use rates started \r\n[L322] at 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\n[L323] the drug test program. The problem with \r\n[L324] this observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\n[L325] know which of the previous conceivable \r\n[L326] scenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\n[L327] occurred. b","[L328] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>","[L329] 184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L330] Determining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\n[L331] If experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\n[L332] bother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\n[L333] than for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\n[L334] the following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\n[L335] use a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\n[L336] body never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\n[L337] more common for those who used cell phones.\r\n[L338] There are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\n[L339] j It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\n[L340] subjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\n[L341] harmful.\r\n[L342] j It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told. How can \r\n[L343] you monitor them to ensure that they adhere to their treatment assignment \r\n[L344] over the 50-year experimental period?\r\n[L345] j Who wants to wait 50 years to get an answer?\r\n[L346] For these reasons, medical experiments are often performed over a short time \r\n[L347] period or often with exposure to treatments that would not be out of the ordinary \r\n[L348] (such as a one-time exposure to cell phone activity). To measure the effects on \r\n[L349] people of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\n[L350] uses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\n[L351] populations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\n[L352] when we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\n[L353] studies. Then we are not deliberately placing people in harm\u2019s way, but observing \r\n[L354] people who have chosen on their own to take part in the activity of interest. In \r\n[L355] today\u2019s information age, a lot of data is readily available to assist (or impede) \r\n[L356] people from making decisions about the relationship between variables. These \r\n[L357] data provide only observational comparisons. We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\n[L358] good observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\n[L359] experiment is not practical.\r\n[L360] Finally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\n[L361] questions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\n[L362] want to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\n[L363] use a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\n[L364] Using Data Already Available\r\n[L365] Of course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\n[L366] question, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\n[L367] instead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\n[L368] your personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\n[L369] phone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\n[L370] Informal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\n[L371] there is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\n[L372] disprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\n[L373] a pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\n[L374] association does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\n[L375] smoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\n[L376] is lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\n[L377] A famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n[L378] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L379] Examples of sources for available data:\r\n[L380] j General Social Survey (GSS)\r\n[L381] j http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\n[L382] j www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\n[L383] j www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\n[L384] j www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\n[L385] Kingdom)\r\n[L386] j www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)","[L387] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>","[L388] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\n[L389] research studies.

Excellent sources of available \r\n[L393] data are listed in the margin on the previous page.\r\n[L394] The Census and Other Sample Surveys\r\n[L395] The General Social Survey (GSS) is an example of a sample survey. It gathers in\ufffeformation by interviewing a sample of subjects from the U.S. adult population to \r\n[L396] provide a snapshot of that population. The study in Example 3 on student drug \r\n[L397] use in schools also used a sample survey.\r\n[L398] 2\r\n[L399] Most surveys of research about cell phones suggest that there is no convincing evidence yet of adverse \r\n[L400] radiation effects (e.g., D. R. Cox, J. Roy. Statist. Soc., Ser. A, vol. 166, pp. 241\u2013246, 2003). The primary \r\n[L401] danger appears to be people using cell phones while driving!\r\n[L402] Sample Survey\r\n[L403] A sample survey selects a sample of subjects from a population and collects data from \r\n[L404] them. In the field of statistics a survey does not just indicate an opinion poll or a question\ufffenaire; it includes any information gathered from or about the subject.\r\n[L405] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study. The subjects provide data \r\n[L406] on the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\n[L407] Most countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\n[L408] number of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\n[L409] them. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\n[L410] entire population.\r\n[L411] In Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\n[L412] of the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n[L413] 1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\n[L414] more than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\n[L415] the population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\n[L416] j The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\n[L417] census. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\n[L418] seats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\n[L419] on how their population size compares with other states.\r\n[L420] j Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\n[L421] j Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\n[L422] and local communities.\r\n[L423] Although it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\n[L424] practice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\n[L425] census bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient. \r\n[L426] Because data are needed regularly on economic variables, such as the unem\ufffeployment rate, the U.S. Bureau of the Census continually takes samples of the \r\n[L427] population rather than relying solely on the complete census. An example is the \r\n[L428] monthly Current Population Survey, which surveys about 50,000 U.S. house\ufffeholds and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the \r\n[L429] United States, including the unemployment rate. It is usually more practical, in \r\n[L430] terms of time and money, to take a sample rather than to try to measure every\ufffeone in a population.","[L431] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 45>","[L432] 186 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L433] For a sample survey to be informative, it is important for the sample to reflect \r\n[L434] the population well.

Women in the study \r\n[L591] were offered mammography screening every two years. The \r\n[L592] goal of the study was to compare incidence-based rates of \r\n[L593] death from breast cancer across four groups:\r\n[L594] 1. Women who from 1996 through 2005 were living in \r\n[L595] countries with screening.\r\n[L596] 2. Women who from 1996 through 2005 were living in \r\n[L597] countries without screening.\r\n[L598] 3.

Give at least two reasons the United States takes a census \r\n[L618] only every 10 years.\r\n[L619] 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\r\n[L620] The sample survey is a common type of nonexperimental study. The first step of \r\n[L621] a sample survey is to define the population targeted by the study. For instance, \r\n[L622] the Gallup organization (www.gallup.com) conducts a monthly survey of about \r\n[L623] 1000 adult Americans. Gallup then reports the percentage of those sampled who \r\n[L624] respond \u201capprove\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way [the \r\n[L625] current president of the United States] is handling his job as president?\u201d If the \r\n[L626] sampling is conducted properly, this provides a good estimate of the approval \r\n[L627] rate within the entire population. The population consists of all adults living in \r\n[L628] the United States.\r\n[L629] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L630] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L631] Sampling Frame\r\n[L632] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L633] taken.\r\n[L634] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L635] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L636] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L637] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L638] of registered students.\r\n[L639] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L640] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L641] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L642] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L643] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L644] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L645] doubtful.\r\n[L646] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L647] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L648] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L649] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L650] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L651] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L652] be misleading.","[L653] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>","[L654] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L655] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L656] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L657] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L658] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L659] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L660] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L661] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L662] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L663] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L664] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L665] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L666] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L667] 5HFDOO\r\n[L668] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L669] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L670] called the sample size. b\r\n[L671] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L672] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L673] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L674] Simple random \r\n[L675] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L676] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L677] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L678] a dinner banquet and raffle. The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\n[L679] of football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\n[L680] everyone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once. (This is \r\n[L681] called sampling without replacement.) To select the two winners, the organiz\ufffeers choose a simple random sample of size n = 2 from the 60 ticket holders. \r\n[L682] Each individual at the banquet receives an entry with a number between 1 and \r\n[L683] 60. Duplicate tickets numbered 1 to 60 are placed in a container and mixed, \r\n[L684] after which the two winning entries are chosen at random. Whoever holds the \r\n[L685] tickets containing the same numbers as those drawn at random wins the foot\ufffeball tickets.\r\n[L686] Questions to Explore\r\n[L687] a. What are the possible samples?\r\n[L688] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 will be drawn?\r\n[L689] c. Professor Shaffer is in attendance at the banquet and holds entry num\ufffeber 1. What is the chance that her entry will be chosen? Mr. Chatterjee \r\n[L690] holds entry number 55. What is the chance that his entry will be chosen?\r\n[L691] Think It Through\r\n[L692] a. The entire collection of possible samples is too long to list, but we can \r\n[L693] visualize the possibilities by listing certain pairs:\r\n[L694] (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), . . . , (1,58), (1,59), (1,60)\r\n[L695] (2,3), (2,4), . . . , (2,58), (2,59), (2,60)\r\n[L696] .\r\n[L697] .\r\n[L698] .\r\n[L699] Example 4 ","[L700] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>","[L701] 190 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L702] Selecting a Simple Random Sample\r\n[L703] What\u2019s a better way to take a simple random sample than blindly drawing slips \r\n[L704] of paper out of a hat? You first number the subjects in the sampling frame. You \r\n[L705] then generate a set of those numbers randomly. Finally, you sample the subjects \r\n[L706] whose numbers were generated. One method of generating numbers randomly \r\n[L707] is to use a random number table. In practice, technology is used to generate the \r\n[L708] sample. This could be an app or a statistical program. The following example \r\n[L709] demonstrates how a random sample is generated in MINITAB (left column).\r\n[L710] Taking a Random Sample Consider taking a random sample of three students \r\n[L711] from a class in which the following students are enrolled: Aisha, Benedict, Chung, \r\n[L712] Diego, Emily, Francisco, Girish, Hank, Isabella, and Jing.\r\n[L713] It can be done in MINITAB, as shown below.\r\n[L714] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L715] The Random Numbers web app from \r\n[L716] the book\u2019s website can also be used to \r\n[L717] generate random numbers. The screenshot \r\n[L718] in the margin next to Example 5 on the next \r\n[L719] page illustrates. b\r\n[L720] (57,58), (57,59), (57,60)\r\n[L721] (58,59), (58,60)\r\n[L722] (59,60)\r\n[L723] b. The first row above contains 59 possible samples, the second row con\ufffetains 58, and so forth. There are thus 59 + 58 + c + 2 + 1, which \r\n[L724] equals 1770 possible samples. The process of randomly selecting two \r\n[L725] unique entries ensures that each possible sample of size 2 has an equal \r\n[L726] chance of occurring. Since there are 1770 possible samples, the chance \r\n[L727] of any one sample being selected is 1 out of 1770.\r\n[L728] c. Looking at the top row in part a, we see that 1 shows up in 59 of the \r\n[L729] samples (all of the samples listed in the top row). So the chance that \r\n[L730] Professor Shaffer wins season tickets is 59 out of 1770.\r\n[L731] Insight\r\n[L732] The chance of 59/1770 for Professor Shaffer is the same as that of \r\n[L733] Mr.\u00a0Chatterjee and everyone else in attendance. In practice, especially with \r\n[L734] large populations, it is difficult to mix the entrants\u2019 numbers in a container \r\n[L735] so that each sample truly has an equal chance of selection. There are better \r\n[L736] ways of selecting simple random samples, as we\u2019ll learn next.\r\n[L737] c Try Exercise 4.16","[L738] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://2a1ab342a4235ad#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60206,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L739] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 45>","[L740] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 191\r\n[L741] When we executed this command in MINITAB, the following random sample \r\n[L742] was obtained.

It \r\n[L751] is too time-consuming and expensive for auditors to review all accounts, \r\n[L752] so they typically review only some of them. So that a school district cannot \r\n[L753] anticipate which accounts will be reviewed, the auditors often take a simple \r\n[L754] random sample of the accounts.\r\n[L755] Questions to Explore\r\n[L756] a. How can the auditors use random numbers to select 10 accounts to \r\n[L757] audit in a school district that has 60 accounts?\r\n[L758] b. Why is it important for the auditors not to use personal judgment in \r\n[L759] selecting the accounts to audit?\r\n[L760] Think It Through\r\n[L761] a. The sampling frame consists of the 60 accounts. We first number the \r\n[L762] accounts 1 through 60. Alternatively, they could list the names of the \r\n[L763] accounts. The accounts MINITAB selected (see below for details of \r\n[L764] the process) were 56, 43, 35, 47, 15, 8, 31, 9, 33, and 36. We cannot \r\n[L765] verify that these numbers are randomly selected, but we know that the \r\n[L766] process used to generate them employs random selection.\r\n[L767] b. By using simple random sampling, the auditors hold the school district \r\n[L768] responsible for all accounts. If the auditors personally chose the ac\ufffecounts to audit, they might select certain accounts each year. A school \r\n[L769] district would soon learn which accounts they need to have in order \r\n[L770] and which accounts can be given less attention.\r\n[L771] Insight\r\n[L772] Likewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) randomly selects some tax re\ufffeturns for audit, so taxpayers cannot predict ahead of time whether they will \r\n[L773] be audited. For efficiency, the IRS samples a small proportion of tax returns \r\n[L774] with small amounts owed and a larger proportion of tax returns with high \r\n[L775] amounts owed. It does this because it cares about the total amount of tax \r\n[L776] revenue brought in.\r\n[L777] c Try Exercise 4.17\r\n[L778] Example 5 \r\n[L779] Methods of Collecting Data in Sample Surveys\r\n[L780] In Example 5, the subjects sampled were accounts. More commonly, they are \r\n[L781] people. For any survey, it is difficult to get a good sampling frame since a list of \r\n[L782] all adults in a population typically does not exist. So, it\u2019s necessary to pick a place \r\n[L783] where almost all people can be found\u2014a person\u2019s place of residence.\r\n[L784] Once we identify the desired sample for a survey, how do we contact the \r\n[L785] people to collect the data?

An advantage is that \r\n[L794] subjects are more likely to participate. A disadvantage is the cost. Also, some sub\ufffejects may not answer sensitive questions pertaining to opinions or lifestyle, such \r\n[L795] as alcohol and drug use, whether they have been victims of sexual abuse, or their \r\n[L796] HIV status that they might answer on a printed questionnaire.\r\n[L797] Telephone interview A telephone interview is like a personal interview but \r\n[L798] conducted over the phone. A main advantage is lower cost because no travel is \r\n[L799] involved. A disadvantage is that the interview might have to be short. Subjects \r\n[L800] generally aren\u2019t as patient on the phone and may hang up before starting or com\ufffepleting the interview.\r\n[L801] Self-administered questionnaire Subjects are requested to fill out a questionnaire \r\n[L802] mailed, e-mailed, or otherwise available online. An advantage is that it is cheaper \r\n[L803] than a personal interview. A disadvantage is that fewer people tend to participate.\r\n[L804] So which method is most used? Most major national polls that survey regularly \r\n[L805] to measure public opinion use the telephone interview. An example is the polls \r\n[L806] conducted by the Gallup organization. The General Social Survey is an exception, \r\n[L807] using personal interviews for its questionnaire, which is quite long.\r\n[L808] For telephone interviews, since the mid-1980s, many sample surveys have used \r\n[L809] random digit dialing to select households. The survey can then obtain a sample \r\n[L810] without having a sampling frame. In the United States, typically the area code \r\n[L811] and the 3-digit exchange are randomly selected from the list of all such codes and \r\n[L812] exchanges. Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\n[L813] randomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\n[L814] randomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\n[L815] likely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\n[L816] exactly one telephone?)\r\n[L817] Sources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\n[L818] A variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\n[L819] the population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\n[L820] of the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n[L821] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L822] Besides Gallup, there are other polling \r\n[L823] groups that conduct national surveys, \r\n[L824] such\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\n[L825] people-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n[L826] (www.zogby.com).

The main way \r\n[L836] this occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\n[L837] undercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\n[L838] the population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\n[L839] prison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\n[L840] consists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\n[L841] landlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\n[L842] those who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\n[L843] are in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\n[L844] sampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\n[L845] Nonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\n[L846] cannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\n[L847] subjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\n[L848] in some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\n[L849] issues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\n[L850] questions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\n[L851] suffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\n[L852] telephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\n[L853] nonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\n[L854] only about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\n[L855] contact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\n[L856] Results have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\n[L857] in her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\n[L858] feminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\n[L859] States. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\n[L860] least five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\n[L861] questionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\n[L862] large. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\n[L863] know whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\n[L864] of the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\n[L865] adult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\n[L866] of using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\n[L867] Response bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\n[L868] This is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\n[L869] way, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\n[L870] lie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\n[L871] the response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\n[L872] If you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\n[L873] questions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\n[L874] long, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\n[L875] Roper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II.

For example, consider \r\n[L890] the population of adults in your \r\n[L891] home town. The results of an opinion \r\n[L892] survey asking about raising the sales \r\n[L893] tax to support public schools may \r\n[L894] be biased in the direction of raising \r\n[L895] taxes if you sample only educators \r\n[L896] or biased in the direction of lowering \r\n[L897] taxes if you sample only business \r\n[L898] owners. Alternatively, the results \r\n[L899] could be biased toward raising taxes \r\n[L900] if a higher proportion of educators \r\n[L901] responded than business owners.\r\n[L902] ,Q3UDFWLFH Be Alert for \r\n[L903] Potential Bias\r\n[L904] With any sample survey, carefully \r\n[L905] scrutinize the results.

Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L932] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L933] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L934] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L935] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L936] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L937] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L938] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L939] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L940] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L941] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L942] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L943] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L944] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L945] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L946] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L947] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L948] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L949] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L950] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L951] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L952] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L953] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L954] than the general population.\r\n[L955] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L956] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L957] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L958] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L959] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L960] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L961] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L962] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L963] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.","[L964] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>","[L965] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L966] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L967] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L968] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L969] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L970] and Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\n[L971] because they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\n[L972] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L973] planned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n[L974] 2.3 million people returned the questionnaire. The Digest predicted that \r\n[L975] Landon would win, getting 57% of the vote. Instead, Landon actually got only \r\n[L976] 36%, and Roosevelt won in a landslide.\r\n[L977] Questions to Explore\r\n[L978] a. What was the population?\r\n[L979] b. How could the Literary Digest poll make such a large error, especially \r\n[L980] with such a huge sample size? What type of bias occurred in this poll?\r\n[L981] Think It Through\r\n[L982] a. The population was all registered voters in the United States in 1936.\r\n[L983] b. This survey had two severe problems:\r\n[L984] j Sampling bias due to undercoverage of the sampling frame and a \r\n[L985] nonrandom sample: In 1936, the United States was in the Great \r\n[L986] Depression. Those who had cars and country club memberships \r\n[L987] and thus received questionnaires tended to be wealthy. The wealthy \r\n[L988] tended to be primarily Republican, the political party of Landon. \r\n[L989] Many potential voters were not on the lists used for the sampling \r\n[L990] frame. There was also no guarantee that a subject in the sampling \r\n[L991] frame was a registered voter.\r\n[L992] j Nonresponse bias: Of the 10 million people who received question\ufffenaires, 7.7 million did not respond. As might be expected, those \r\n[L993] individuals who were unhappy with the incumbent (Roosevelt) were \r\n[L994] more likely to respond.\r\n[L995] Insight\r\n[L996] For this same election, a pollster who was getting his new polling agency off the \r\n[L997] ground surveyed 50,000 people and predicted that Roosevelt would win. Who \r\n[L998] was this pollster? George Gallup. The Gallup organization is still with us today. \r\n[L999] However, the Literary Digest went out of business soon after the 1936 election.6\r\n[L1000] c Try Exercise 4.24\r\n[L1001] Example 6 \r\n[L1002] A Large Sample Size Does Not Guarantee \r\n[L1003] an\u00a0Unbiased Sample\r\n[L1004] Many people think that as long as the sample size is large, it doesn\u2019t matter how \r\n[L1005] the sample was selected. This is incorrect, as illustrated by the Literary Digest\r\n[L1006] poll. A sample size of 2.3 million did not prevent poor results. The sample was \r\n[L1007] 6\r\n[L1008] Bryson, M. C. (1976), American Statistician, vol. 30, pp. 184\u2013185.","[L1009] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 45>","[L1010] 196 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1011] not representative of the population, and the sample percentage of 57% who \r\n[L1012] said they would vote for Landon was far from the actual population percentage \r\n[L1013] of 36% who voted for him. As another example, consider trying to estimate the \r\n[L1014] average grade point average (GPA) on your campus. If you select 10 students \r\n[L1015] from the library, you can produce an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs \r\n[L1016] (assuming those students who go to the library are studying more than those who \r\n[L1017] don\u2019t). If you, instead, gather a larger sample of 30 students from the library, you \r\n[L1018] still have an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs. The larger sample size \r\n[L1019] did not fix the problem of sampling in the library. Many Internet surveys have \r\n[L1020] thousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\n[L1021] as a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller. We\u2019re almost \r\n[L1022] always better off with a simple random sample of 100 people than with a volunteer \r\n[L1023] sample of thousands of people.\r\n[L1024] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Sample Survey\r\n[L1025] j Identify the population of all the subjects of interest.\r\n[L1026] j Define a sampling frame, which attempts to list all the subjects in the population.\r\n[L1027] j Use a random sampling design, implemented using random numbers, to select n\r\n[L1028] subjects from the sampling frame.\r\n[L1029] j Be cautious about sampling bias due to nonrandom samples (such as volunteer \r\n[L1030] samples) and sample undercoverage, response bias from subjects not giving their \r\n[L1031] true response or from poorly worded questions, and nonresponse bias from refusal \r\n[L1032] of subjects to participate.\r\n[L1033] In Section 4.1 we learned that experimental studies are preferable to nonex\ufffeperimental studies but are not always possible. Some types of nonexperimental \r\n[L1034] studies have fewer potential pitfalls than others. For a sample survey with random \r\n[L1035] sampling, we can make inferences about the population of interest. By contrast, \r\n[L1036] with a study using a convenience sample, results apply only to those subjects actu\ufffeally observed. For this reason, some researchers use the term observational study\r\n[L1037] to refer only to studies that use available subjects (such as a convenience sample) \r\n[L1038] and not to sample surveys that randomly select their sample.\r\n[L1039] 4.15 Choosing officers A campus club consists of five officers: \r\n[L1040] president (P), vice president (V), secretary (S), treasurer \r\n[L1041] (T), and activity coordinator (A). The club can select two \r\n[L1042] officers to travel to New Orleans for a conference; for \r\n[L1043] fairness, they decide to make the selection at random. In \r\n[L1044] essence, they are choosing a simple random sample of size \r\n[L1045] n = 2.\r\n[L1046] a. What are the possible samples of two officers?\r\n[L1047] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 \r\n[L1048] will be drawn?\r\n[L1049] c.

Hydraulic \r\n[L1091] fracturing, or fracking, is the process of drilling through \r\n[L1092] rock and injecting a pressurized mixture of sand, water, \r\n[L1093] and chemicals that fractures the rock and releases oil and \r\n[L1094] gas. There has been much debate in the media about its \r\n[L1095] impact on the environment, on land owners, and on the \r\n[L1096] economy. The survey involved contacting a nationally \r\n[L1097] representative sample of 1960 adults in 2012. Of the 1960 \r\n[L1098] people contacted, 1061 adults responded to the survey. \r\n[L1099] The study reported that those more familiar with fracking, \r\n[L1100] women, and those holding egalitarian worldviews were \r\n[L1101] more likely to oppose fracking.\r\n[L1102] a.

First, let\u2019s recall the \r\n[L1222] definition of an experimental study from Section 4.1: We assign each subject to an \r\n[L1223] experimental condition, called a treatment. We then observe the outcome on the \r\n[L1224] response variable. The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L1225] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L1226] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L1227] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L1228] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L1229] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L1230] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1231] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L1232] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L1233] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L1234] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L1235] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L1236] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L1237] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L1238] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L1239] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L1240] would like to quit.\r\n[L1241] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L1242] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L1243] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L1244] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L1245]  You need \r\n[L1246] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L1247] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L1248] 8\r\n[L1249] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L1250] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.","[L1251] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>","[L1252] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L1253] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L1254] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L1255] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L1256] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L1257] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L1258] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L1259] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L1260] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L1261] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L1262] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L1263] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L1264] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L1265] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L1266] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L1267] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L1268] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L1269] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\n[L1270] subjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\n[L1271] antidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\n[L1272] control group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n[L1273] 33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\n[L1274] compared to the placebo group.\r\n[L1275] In some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\n[L1276] than a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\n[L1277] an antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\n[L1278] It may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\n[L1279] patch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\n[L1280] a placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\n[L1281] nicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\n[L1282] Randomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\n[L1283] subjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\n[L1284] treatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\n[L1285] the study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\n[L1286] subconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\n[L1287] group that receives the antidepressant.\r\n[L1288] It is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\n[L1289] the 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\n[L1290] control group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\n[L1291] younger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\n[L1292] making them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\n[L1293] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L1294] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L1295] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L1296] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L1297] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L1298] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L1299] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L1300] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L1301] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L1302] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L1303] one treatment.","[L1304] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>","[L1305] 200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1306] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L1307] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L1308] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L1309] An analysis9\r\n[L1310]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L1311] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L1312] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L1313] studies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L1314] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L1315] 9\r\n[L1316] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L1317] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L1318] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L1319] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L1320] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L1321] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L1322] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L1323] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L1324] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L1325] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L1326] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L1327] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L1328] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L1329] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L1330] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L1331] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L1332] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L1333] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1334] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L1335] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L1336] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L1337] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L1338] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L1339] The other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\n[L1340] study observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\n[L1341] Questions to Explore\r\n[L1342] a. Identify the response and explanatory variables, the treatments, and the \r\n[L1343] experimental units.\r\n[L1344] Example 7 ","[L1345] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 45>","[L1346] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 201\r\n[L1347] Generalizing Results to Broader Populations\r\n[L1348] We\u2019ve seen that random samples are preferable to convenience samples, yet con\ufffevenience samples are more feasible than many experiments. When an experiment \r\n[L1349] uses a convenience sample, be cautious about the extent to which results gener\ufffealize to a larger population. Look carefully at the characteristics of the sample. \r\n[L1350] Do they seem representative of the overall population? If not, the results have \r\n[L1351] dubious worth.\r\n[L1352] b. How should the researchers assign the subjects to the two treatment \r\n[L1353] groups?\r\n[L1354] c.

This experiment has\r\n[L1358] Response variable: Whether the subject abstains from smoking for \r\n[L1359] one year (yes or no)\r\n[L1360] Explanatory variable: Whether the subject received bupropion (yes \r\n[L1361] or no)\r\n[L1362] Treatments: bupropion, no bupropion\r\n[L1363] Experimental units: The 429 volunteers who are the study subjects\r\n[L1364] b. The researchers should randomize to assign subjects to the two treat\ufffements. They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\n[L1365] of the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\n[L1366] to the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group). The \r\n[L1367] procedure would be as follows:\r\n[L1368] j Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\n[L1369] j Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\n[L1370] bupropion group.\r\n[L1371] j Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\n[L1372] values between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\n[L1373] will receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n[L1374]  control group.\r\n[L1375] c. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\n[L1376] whether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\n[L1377] sources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\n[L1378] abstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\n[L1379] Insight\r\n[L1380] In the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\n[L1381] year, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\n[L1382] with 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\n[L1383] were not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects. However, after \r\n[L1384] two years, the percentage of nonsmokers was similar for the two groups, 42% \r\n[L1385] versus 40%.\r\n[L1386] c Try Exercise 4.32\r\n[L1387] ,Q3UDFWLFH The Randomized \r\n[L1388] Experiment in Medicine\r\n[L1389] In medicine, the randomized \r\n[L1390] experiment (clinical trial) has become \r\n[L1391] the gold standard for evaluating new \r\n[L1392] medical treatments.

A psy\ufffechologist may conduct an experiment using a sample of students from an intro\ufffeductory psychology course. For the results to be of wider interest, however, the \r\n[L1412] psychologist might claim that the conclusions generalize to all college students, \r\n[L1413] to all young adults, or even to all adults.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\n[L1585] extended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\n[L1586] alternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\n[L1587] of observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\n[L1588] with humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\n[L1589] or more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\n[L1590] Sample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\n[L1591] Designs\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\n[L1592] Simple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\n[L1593] In practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\n[L1594] or are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\n[L1595] Sometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\n[L1596] Cluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\n[L1597] frame\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\n[L1598] information is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\n[L1599] study of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\n[L1600] students can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\n[L1601] observing each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\n[L1602] For instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\n[L1603] your city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\n[L1604] city blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\n[L1605] then select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\n[L1606] Cluster Random Sample\r\n[L1607] Divide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\n[L1608] random sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\n[L1609] cluster random sample.\r\n[L1610] For personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\n[L1611] sampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\n[L1612] many observations quickly and with little travel.\r\n[L1613] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\n[L1614] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1615] Cluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\n[L1616] j A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\n[L1617] j The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\n[L1618] The disadvantages are:\r\n[L1619] j We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\n[L1620] of precision.\r\n[L1621] j Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.","[L1622] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>","[L1623] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\n[L1624] Stratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\n[L1625] number of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement. The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L1626] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L1627] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L1628] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L1629] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L1630] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L1631] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L1632] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L1633] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L1634] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L1635] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L1636] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L1637] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\n[L1638] each subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\n[L1639] in your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\n[L1640] students who work and who don\u2019t work. However, this information may not be \r\n[L1641] available for each student.\r\n[L1642] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Stratified \r\n[L1643] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1644] Stratified random sampling has the\r\n[L1645] j Advantage that you can include in your sample enough subjects in each group \r\n[L1646] (stratum) you want to evaluate.\r\n[L1647] j Disadvantage that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into \r\n[L1648] which each subject belongs.\r\n[L1649] What\u2019s the difference between a stratified sample and a cluster sample? A \r\n[L1650] stratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L1651] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L1652] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L1653] random sample).\r\n[L1654] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L1655] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L1656] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L1657] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L1658] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L1659] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L1660] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L1661] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L1662] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L1663] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L1664] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of ","[L1665] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>","[L1666] 206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1667] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L1668] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L1669] be infeasible.\r\n[L1670] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L1671] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L1672] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L1673] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L1674] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L1675] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L1676] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L1677] sampling.

With an observational study, it\u2019s possible that an association \r\n[L1714] is due to some lurking variable. However, observational studies do have advan\ufffetages. It\u2019s often not practical to conduct an experiment. For instance, with human \r\n[L1715] subjects it\u2019s not ethical to design an experiment to study the long-term effect of \r\n[L1716] cell phone use on getting cancer. Nevertheless, it is possible to design an observa\ufffetional study that controls for identified lurking variables.\r\n[L1717] Rather than taking a cross section of a population at some time, such as with \r\n[L1718] a sample survey, some studies are backward looking (retrospective) or forward \r\n[L1719] looking (prospective). Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\n[L1720] How can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\n[L1721] use and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\n[L1722] of subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\n[L1723] and then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups.

All patients were queried about \r\n[L1732] their smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\n[L1733] least one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\n[L1734] to look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\n[L1735] Table 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\n[L1736] were the patients with lung cancer.

The lung \r\n[L1757] cancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\n[L1758] Insight\r\n[L1759] An inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\n[L1760] This suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1761] c Try Exercise 4.46\r\n[L1762] Case-Control Study\r\n[L1763] A case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\n[L1764] a\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\n[L1765] outcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1766] This is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\n[L1767] ethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\n[L1768] smoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\n[L1769] potential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\n[L1770] variables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\n[L1771] and hospital.\r\n[L1772] In a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\n[L1773] fixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\n[L1774] For instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\n[L1775] time to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\n[L1776] the explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\n[L1777] or control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\n[L1778] subjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\n[L1779] half the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\n[L1780] had lung cancer.\r\n[L1781] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L1782] In Example 8, the response \r\n[L1783] outcome of interest was having lung \r\n[L1784] cancer. The cases had lung cancer, \r\n[L1785] the controls did not have lung \r\n[L1786] cancer, and they were compared on \r\n[L1787] the explanatory variable\u2014whether \r\n[L1788] the subject had been a smoker \r\n[L1789] (yes\u00a0or no).\r\n[L1790] Case-control \r\n[L1791] studies b Cell Phone Use\r\n[L1792] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1793] Studies 1 and 2 about cell phone use in Example 1 were both case-control \r\n[L1794] studies. In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\n[L1795] randomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\n[L1796] cases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\n[L1797] eye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\n[L1798] subjects with the cases.\r\n[L1799] Question to Explore\r\n[L1800] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L1801] such as age?\r\n[L1802] Example 9 ","[L1803] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>","[L1804] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\n[L1805] Prospective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\n[L1806] into the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\n[L1807] Think It Through\r\n[L1808] We\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\n[L1809] such as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\n[L1810] were observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\n[L1811] researchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\n[L1812] variables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\n[L1813] provides.\r\n[L1814] When researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\n[L1815] relationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\n[L1816] is not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\n[L1817] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1818] Insight\r\n[L1819] The lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\n[L1820] the two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\n[L1821] finding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\n[L1822] to be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\n[L1823] users of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\n[L1824] c Try Exercise 4.47\r\n[L1825] Prospective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\n[L1826] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1827] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\n[L1828] began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years.

By contrast, at the start \r\n[L1836] of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\n[L1837] would eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer. The study followed \r\n[L1838] each nurse into the future to see whether she developed that outcome and \r\n[L1839] to analyze whether certain explanatory variables (such as smoking) were \r\n[L1840] associated with it.\r\n[L1841] Example 10 \r\n[L1842] 11More information on this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00005152 and at \r\n[L1843] www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs.","[L1844] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://9817beec834ef81#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":69393,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1845] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 45>","[L1846] 210 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1847] Observational Studies and Causation\r\n[L1848] Can we ever definitively establish causation with an observational study? No, we \r\n[L1849] cannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\n[L1850] was observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\n[L1851] have caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\n[L1852] smoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\n[L1853] conducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\n[L1854] time, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\n[L1855] of lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\n[L1856] retrospective and prospective, have added more evidence. For example, when a \r\n[L1857] prospective study begun in 1951 with 35,000 doctors ended in 2001, researchers12\r\n[L1858] estimated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who \r\n[L1859] never quit. This study estimated that at least half the people who smoke from \r\n[L1860] youth are eventually killed by their habit.\r\n[L1861] Most important, studies carried out on different populations of people have \r\n[L1862] consistently concluded that smoking is associated with lung cancer, even after ad\ufffejusting for all potentially confounding variables that researchers have suggested. \r\n[L1863] As more studies are done that adjust for confounding variables, the chance that a \r\n[L1864] lurking variable remains that can explain the association is reduced. As a conse\ufffequence, although we cannot definitively conclude that smoking causes lung can\ufffecer, physicians will not hesitate to tell you that they believe it does. As do most \r\n[L1865] statisticians, including the four authors of this text!\r\n[L1866] Multifactor Experiments\r\n[L1867] Now let\u2019s learn about other ways of performing experiments. First, we\u2019ll learn \r\n[L1868] how a single experiment can help us analyze the effects of two explanatory vari\ufffeables at once.\r\n[L1869] Categorical explanatory variables in an experiment are often referred to as \r\n[L1870] factors. For example, consider the experiment described in Example 7 to study \r\n[L1871] whether taking an antidepressant can help a smoker stop smoking. The factor \r\n[L1872] Insight\r\n[L1873] Over the years, several analyses have been conducted using data from \r\n[L1874] the Nurses\u2019 Health Study. One finding (reported in The New York Times, \r\n[L1875] February 11, 2003) was that nurses in this study who were highly overweight \r\n[L1876] 18-year-olds were five times as likely as young women of normal weight to \r\n[L1877] need hip replacement later in life.\r\n[L1878] c Try Exercise 4.48\r\n[L1879] SUMMARY: Types of Nonexperimental Studies\r\n[L1880] j A retrospective study looks into the past.\r\n[L1881] j A prospective study identifies a group (cohort) of people and observes them in \r\n[L1882] the future. In research literature, prospective studies are often referred to as cohort \r\n[L1883] studies.\r\n[L1884] j A sample survey takes a cross section of a population at the current time. \r\n[L1885] Sample surveys are sometimes called cross-sectional studies.\r\n[L1886] 12See article by R.

The experiment could then have four treatment \r\n[L1899] groups that result from cross-classifying the two factors. See Figure 4.3. The four \r\n[L1900] treatments are bupropion alone, nicotine patch alone, bupropion and nicotine \r\n[L1901] patch, neither bupropion nor nicotine patch.\r\n[L1902] Nicotine Patch (Factor 1)\r\n[L1903] Yes\r\n[L1904] Yes\r\n[L1905] No\r\n[L1906] Treatment 1\r\n[L1907] Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1908] Bupropion\r\n[L1909] Treatment 3\r\n[L1910] Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1911] Placebo\r\n[L1912] Treatment 4\r\n[L1913]  No Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1914] Placebo\r\n[L1915] Treatment 2\r\n[L1916] No Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1917] Bupropion\r\n[L1918] Bupropion\r\n[L1919] (Factor 2)\r\n[L1920] No\r\n[L1921] m Figure 4.3 An Experiment Can Use Two (or More) Factors at Once. The treatments are \r\n[L1922] the combinations of categories of the factors, as numbered in the boxes.\r\n[L1923] Why use both factors at once in an experiment? Why not do one experiment \r\n[L1924] about bupropion and a separate experiment about the nicotine patch? The rea\ufffeson is that we can learn more from a two-factor experiment. For instance, the \r\n[L1925] combination of using both a nicotine patch and bupropion may be more effective \r\n[L1926] than using either method alone.\r\n[L1927] Multifactor \r\n[L1928] experiments b Antidepressants and/or Nicotine Patches\r\n[L1929] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1930] Example 7 analyzed a study about whether bupropion helps a smoker quit \r\n[L1931] cigarettes. Let\u2019s now also consider nicotine patches as another possible ces\ufffesation aid.\r\n[L1932] Question to Explore\r\n[L1933] How can you design a single study to investigate the effects of nicotine \r\n[L1934] patches and bupropion on whether a subject relapses into smoking?\r\n[L1935] Think It Through\r\n[L1936] You could use the two factors with four treatment groups shown in Figure\u00a04.3. \r\n[L1937] Figure 4.4 portrays the design of a randomized experiment, with placebo al\ufffeternatives to bupropion and to the nicotine patch.\r\n[L1938] The study should be double-blind. After a fixed length of time, you com\ufffepare the four treatments for the percentages who have relapsed.\r\n[L1939] Insight\r\n[L1940] In fact, a two-factor experiment has been conducted to study both these fac\ufffetors.13 The most effective treatments were bupropion alone or in combination \r\n[L1941] Example 11 \r\n[L1942] 13Jorenby, D. et al.

Medical experiments often do this to compare treat\ufffements for chronic conditions that do not have a permanent cure.\r\n[L1950] To illustrate, suppose a study plans to compare an oral drug and a placebo for \r\n[L1951] treating migraine headaches. The subjects could take one treatment the first time \r\n[L1952] they get a migraine headache and the other treatment the second time they get \r\n[L1953] a migraine headache. The response is whether the subject\u2019s pain is relieved.

Question A three-factor design \r\n[L1976] could also incorporate whether a subject receives counseling to discourage smoking. \r\n[L1977] What would such a diagram look like?\r\n[L1978] with a nicotine patch. We\u2019ll explore the results in Exercise 4.72. If we in\ufffecluded a third factor of whether the subject receives counseling, we would \r\n[L1979] have three factors with 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 treatments to compare.\r\n[L1980] c Try Exercise 4.50\r\n[L1981] 5HFDOO\r\n[L1982] This study is double-blind if both the \r\n[L1983] subjects and the evaluator(s) of the subjects \r\n[L1984] do not know whether the pill is active and \r\n[L1985] whether the patch is active. b\r\n[L1986] Subject Drug Placebo\r\n[L1987] 1 Relief No relief d first matched pair\r\n[L1988] 2 Relief Relief\r\n[L1989] 3 No relief No relief\r\n[L1990] For the entire sample, we would compare the percentage of subjects who have \r\n[L1991] pain relief with the drug to the percentage who have pain relief with the placebo. \r\n[L1992] The two observations for a particular subject are called a matched pair because \r\n[L1993] they both come from the same person.\r\n[L1994] A matched-pairs design in which subjects cross over during the experiment \r\n[L1995] from using one treatment to using another treatment is called a crossover design. \r\n[L1996] Crossover design helps remove certain sources of potential bias. Using the same \r\n[L1997] subjects for each treatment keeps potential lurking variables from affecting the ","[L1998] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 45>","[L1999] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 213\r\n[L2000] results because those variables take the same values for each treatment. For in\ufffestance, any difference observed between the drug and the placebo responses is \r\n[L2001] not because subjects taking the drug had better overall health. Another example \r\n[L2002] of a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\n[L2003] An additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types. In each field, two \r\n[L2004] plots are marked, one for each fertilizer. Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L2005] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L2006] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L2007] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L2008] applied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\n[L2009] can\u2019t use many fields.\r\n[L2010] Blocking in an Experiment\r\n[L2011] The matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements. The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\n[L2012] The crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\n[L2013] In experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\n[L2014] to as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\n[L2015] within blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\n[L2016] study, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\n[L2017] so they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\n[L2018] To reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\n[L2019] In the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\n[L2020] be randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\n[L2021] effect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\n[L2022] the second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\n[L2023] assigned to the plots in a field.\r\n[L2024] culprit. They were also pioneers in developing a sound theo\uffferetical basis for the case-control method. They followed their \r\n[L2025] initial study with other case-control studies and with a long-term \r\n[L2026] prospective study that showed that smoking was not only the \r\n[L2027] predominant risk factor for lung cancer but also correlated with \r\n[L2028] other diseases.\r\n[L2029] At first, Bradford Hill was cautious about claiming that \r\n[L2030] smoking causes lung cancer. As the evidence mounted from \r\n[L2031] various studies, he accepted the causal link as being overwhelm\ufffeingly the most likely explanation. An influential article written \r\n[L2032] by Bradford Hill in 1965 proposed criteria that should be sat\ufffeisfied before you conclude that an association reflects a causal \r\n[L2033] link. For his work, in 1961 Austin Bradford Hill was knighted by \r\n[L2034] Queen Elizabeth. Richard Doll was knighted in 1971.\r\n[L2035] In the mid-20th century, Austin Bradford Hill was Britain\u2019s \r\n[L2036] leading medical statistician. In 1946, to assess the effect of strep\ufffetomycin in treating pulmonary tuberculosis, he designed what is \r\n[L2037] now regarded as the first controlled randomized medical exper\ufffeiment. About that time, doctors noticed the alarming increase \r\n[L2038] in the number of lung cancer cases. The cause was unknown \r\n[L2039] but suspected to be atmospheric pollution, particularly coal \r\n[L2040] smoke.

The sports website ESPN.com asked visitors \r\n[L2289] of the site which team would win the Southeast region. \r\n[L2290] CHAPTER SUMMARY \r\n[L2291] This chapter introduced methods for gathering data.\r\n[L2292] j An experiment assigns subjects to experimental conditions (such \r\n[L2293] as drug or placebo) called treatments. These are categories of \r\n[L2294] the explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\n[L2295] is then observed for each subject.\r\n[L2296] j An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\n[L2297] that observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\n[L2298] observes rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\n[L2299] Since association does not imply causation, with observational \r\n[L2300] studies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\n[L2301] influence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\n[L2302] randomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\n[L2303] to the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\n[L2304] variables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\n[L2305] causation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\n[L2306] with neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\n[L2307] treatment a subject was assigned.\r\n[L2308] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\n[L2309] a sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\n[L2310] incorporate random sampling.\r\n[L2311] j A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\n[L2312] in which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\n[L2313] being selected.\r\n[L2314] j A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\n[L2315] clusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\n[L2316] as the sample.\r\n[L2317] j A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\n[L2318] groups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\n[L2319] from each stratum.\r\n[L2320] Be cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\n[L2321] such as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\n[L2322] random sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\n[L2323] nonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\n[L2324] are biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\n[L2325] Most sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\n[L2326] with many experiments. Medical studies often use retrospective\r\n[L2327] observational studies, which look at subjects\u2019 behavior in the past.\r\n[L2328] j A case-control study is an example of a retrospective study. \r\n[L2329] Subjects who have a response outcome of interest, such as \r\n[L2330] cancer, serve as cases. Other subjects not having that outcome \r\n[L2331] serve as controls. The cases and controls are compared on an \r\n[L2332] explanatory variable, such as whether they had been smokers.\r\n[L2333] A categorical explanatory variable in an experiment is also called a \r\n[L2334] factor. Multifactor experiments have at least two explanatory vari\ufffeables. With a completely randomized design, subjects are assigned \r\n[L2335] randomly to categories of each explanatory variable. Some designs \r\n[L2336] instead use blocks\u2014sets of experimental units that are matched. \r\n[L2337] Matched-pairs designs have two observations in each block. Often \r\n[L2338] this is the same subject observed for each of two treatments, such as \r\n[L2339] in a crossover study.\r\n[L2340] Data are only as good as the method used to obtain them. \r\n[L2341] Unless we use a good study design, conclusions may be faulty.","[L2342] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 45>","[L2343] Chapter Problems 217\r\n[L2344] c.

Meanwhile, the \r\n[L2641] percentage of the population who has tried marijuana \r\n[L2642] has increased dramatically in the United States over the \r\n[L2643] past 50 years, whereas the percentage of the population \r\n[L2644] affected by schizophrenia has remained constant at about \r\n[L2645] 1%.

In fact, of the 16 babies \r\n[L2827] in the study, half were shown the videos in one order \r\n[L2828] while the other half was shown the videos in the opposite \r\n[L2829]  order. Explain how to use the Random Numbers web app \r\n[L2830] to randomly divide the 16 infants into two groups of 8.\r\n[L2831] 4.96 Distinguish helping and hindering among infants, \r\n[L2832]  continued Fourteen of the 16 infants in the Yale study \r\n[L2833] elected to play with a toy resembling the helpful figure as \r\n[L2834] opposed to one resembling the hindering figure. Is this \r\n[L2835] convincing evidence that infants tend to prefer the helpful \r\n[L2836] figure? Use the Random Numbers web app on the book\u2019s \r\n[L2837] website to investigate the approximate likelihood of the \r\n[L2838] observed results of 14 out of 16 infants choosing the help\ufffeful figure, if in fact infants are indifferent between the two \r\n[L2839] figures. To perform a simulation with this app, click on the \r\n[L2840] Coin Flips tab and set the number of flips to generate equal \r\n[L2841] to 16. Click on Simulate and determine the number of heads \r\n[L2842] in the generated sequence. This represents the number of \r\n[L2843] times the child selects the helpful toy if they choose at ran\ufffedom. Repeat this simulation for a total of 10 simulations. \r\n[L2844] Out of the 10 simulations, how often did you obtain 14 or \r\n[L2845] more heads out of 16 tosses? Are your results convincing \r\n[L2846] evidence that infants actually tend to exhibit a preference?\r\n[L2847] For Exercises 4.97\u20134.103, select the best response.\r\n[L2848] 4.97 Multiple choice: What\u2019s a simple random sample? \r\n[L2849] A\u00a0simple random sample of size n is one in which\r\n[L2850] a.

An \r\n[L2859] analysis of published medical studies about heart attacks \r\n[L2860] (Crossen, 1994, p. 168) noted that in the studies having ran\ufffedomization and strong controls for bias, the new therapy \r\n[L2861] provided improved treatment 9% of the time. In studies \r\n[L2862] without randomization or other controls for bias, the new \r\n[L2863] therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time.","[L2864] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 44 / 45>","[L2865] 222 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L2866] b.

Explain why you\u2019ll \r\n[L2877] tend to get a smaller sample mean if you sample n\r\n[L2878] families than if you sample n individuals (asking them \r\n[L2879] to report their family size). (Hint: When you sample \r\n[L2880] individuals, explain why you are more likely to sample \r\n[L2881] a large family than a small family. To think of this, it \r\n[L2882] may help to consider the case n = 1 with a population \r\n[L2883] of two families, one with 10\u00a0people and one with only \r\n[L2884] 2\u00a0people.)\r\n[L2885] 4.107 Capture\u2013recapture Biologists and naturalists often \r\n[L2886] use sampling to estimate sizes of populations, such as \r\n[L2887] deer or fish, for which a census is impossible. Capture\u2013 \r\n[L2888] recapture is one method for doing this. A biologist \r\n[L2889] wants to count the deer population in a certain region. \r\n[L2890] She captures 50 deer, tags each, and then releases them. \r\n[L2891] Several weeks later, she captures 125 deer and finds \r\n[L2892] that 12 of them were tagged. Let N = population size,\r\n[L2893] M = size of first sample, n = size of second sample, \r\n[L2894] R = number tagged in second sample.

It states that \u201cresearch \r\n[L2905] for the Bar found that over 40 percent of female junior \r\n[L2906] tenants said they had encountered sexual harassment \r\n[L2907] during their time at the Bar.\u201d This was based on a study \r\n[L2908] conducted at the University of Sheffield that sent a \r\n[L2909] questionnaire to 334 junior tenants at the Bar, of whom \r\n[L2910] 159 responded. Of the 159, 67 were female. Of those \r\n[L2911] females, 3 said they had experienced sexual harassment \r\n[L2912] as a major problem, and 24 had experienced it as a slight \r\n[L2913] problem.\r\n[L2914] a. The quoted statement might be misleading because \r\n[L2915] the nonresponse was large.\r\n[L2916] b. No one was forced to respond, so everyone had a \r\n[L2917] chance to be in the sample, which implies it was a \r\n[L2918] simple random sample.\r\n[L2919] c. This was an example of a completely randomized \r\n[L2920]  experiment, with whether a female junior tenant \r\n[L2921]  experienced sexual harassment as the response \r\n[L2922] variable.\r\n[L2923] d. This was a retrospective case-control study, with those \r\n[L2924] who received sexual harassment as the cases.\r\n[L2925] 4.103 Multiple choice: Effect of response categories A study \r\n[L2926] (N. Schwarz et al., Public Opinion Quarterly, vol. 49, 1985, \r\n[L2927] p. 388) asked German adults how many hours a day they \r\n[L2928] spend watching TV on a typical day. When the possible \r\n[L2929] responses were the six categories (up to 1\r\n[L2930] 2 hour, 1\r\n[L2931] 2 to 1 hour, \r\n[L2932] 1 to 11\r\n[L2933] 2 hours, . . . , more than 21\r\n[L2934] 2 hours), 16% of respondents \r\n[L2935] said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2936] 2 hours per day. When the \r\n[L2937] six categories were (up to 21\r\n[L2938] 2 hours, 21\r\n[L2939] 2 to 3 hours, . . . , more \r\n[L2940] than 4 hours), 38% said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2941] 2 hours \r\n[L2942] per day.\r\n[L2943] a. The samples could not have been random, or this \r\n[L2944] would not have happened.\r\n[L2945] b. This shows the importance of question design, especially \r\n[L2946] when people may be uncertain what the answer to the \r\n[L2947] question really is.\r\n[L2948] c. This study was an experiment, not an observational \r\n[L2949] study.\r\n[L2950] 4.104 Systematic sampling A researcher wants to select 1% of \r\n[L2951] the 10,000 subjects from the sampling frame. She selects \r\n[L2952] subjects by picking one of the first 100 on the list at ran\ufffedom, skipping 100 names to get the next subject, skipping \r\n[L2953] another 100 names to get the next subject, and so on. \r\n[L2954] This is called a systematic random sample.\r\n[L2955] a. With simple random sampling, (i) every subject is equally \r\n[L2956] likely to be chosen, and (ii) every possible sample of size \r\n[L2957] n is equally likely. Indicate which, if any, of (i) and (ii) \r\n[L2958] are true for systematic random samples. Explain.\r\n[L2959] In First Sample?\r\n[L2960] Yes (tagged) No (not tagged) Total\r\n[L2961] In Second Yes R n\r\n[L2962] Sample? No\r\n[L2963] Total M N\r\n[L2964] a. Identify the values of M, n, and R for the biologist\u2019s \r\n[L2965] experiment.\r\n[L2966] b. One way to estimate N lets the sample proportion of \r\n[L2967] tagged deer equal the population proportion of tagged \r\n[L2968] deer. Explain why this means that\r\n[L2969] R\r\n[L2970] n = M\r\n[L2971] N\r\n[L2972] and, hence, that the estimated population size is \r\n[L2973] N = 1M * n2 >R\r\n[L2974] c.

The U.S. Bureau of the Census uses capture\u2013recapture \r\n[L2977] to make adjustments to the census by estimating the \r\n[L2978] undercount. The capture phase is the census itself \r\n[L2979] (persons are \u201ctagged\u201d by having returned their census \r\n[L2980] form and being recorded as counted), and the recap\ufffeture phase (the second sample) is the postenumerative \r\n[L2981] survey (PES) conducted after the census.

Pour the Cheddar Goldfish into \r\n[L2990] a paper bag, which represents the pond. Sample 10 of \r\n[L2991] them. For this initial sample, use Pretzel Goldfish to \r\n[L2992] replace them, to represent the tagged fish. Then select a \r\n[L2993] second sample and derive an estimate for N, the number \r\n[L2994] of Cheddar Goldfish in the original bag. See how close \r\n[L2995] your estimate comes to the actual number of fish in the \r\n[L2996] bag. (Your teacher will count the population of Cheddar \r\n[L2997] Goldfish in the bag before beginning the sampling.)

A particular value of center is \r\n[L3007] the mean area of the states. A map and a list of the states \r\n[L3008] with their areas (in square miles) are shown in the figure \r\n[L3009] and table that follow. Area for a state includes dry land \r\n[L3010] and permanent inland water surface.\r\n[L3011] Although we could use these data to calculate the actual \r\n[L3012] mean area, let\u2019s explore how well sampling performs \r\n[L3013] in estimating the mean area by sampling five states and \r\n[L3014] finding the sample mean.\r\n[L3015] a. The most convenient sampling design is to use our \r\n[L3016] eyes to pick five states from the map that we think \r\n[L3017] have areas representative of all the states. Do this, \r\n[L3018] picking five states that you believe have areas rep\uffferesentative of the actual mean area of the states. \r\n[L3019] Compute their sample mean area.\r\n[L3020] b.

Note the shape, center, \r\n[L3023] and variability of the distribution.\r\n[L3024] c. Another possible sampling design is simple random \r\n[L3025] sampling. Randomly select five states (using an app \r\n[L3026] or computer program) and compute the sample \r\n[L3027] mean area.\r\n[L3028] d.

The true mean total land area for the 48 states can \r\n[L3034] be calculated from the accompanying table by divid\ufffeing the total at the bottom of the table by 48.

Cell \r\n[L42] phones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\n[L43] main source of this energy. The closer \r\n[L44] the antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\n[L45] greater the exposure to radiation. \r\n[L46] With the increased use of cell phones, \r\n[L47] there has been a growing concern \r\n[L48] over the potential health risks. Several \r\n[L49] studies have explored the possibility \r\n[L50] of such risks:\r\n[L51] Study 1 A German study (Stang \r\n[L52] et\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\n[L53] with a rare form of eye cancer called \r\n[L54] uveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n[L55]  patients who did not have this eye \r\n[L56] cancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\n[L57] was measured using a questionnaire. \r\n[L58] On average, the eye cancer patients \r\n[L59] used cell phones more often.\r\n[L60] Study 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\n[L61] et al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\n[L62] with brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\n[L63] without brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\n[L64] cell phone use was measured using a \r\n[L65] questionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\n[L66] two groups was similar.\r\n[L67] Study 3 A study published in The \r\n[L68] Journal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\n[L69] that cell phone use speeds up activity \r\n[L70] in the brain. As part of a randomized \r\n[L71] crossover study, 47 participants were \r\n[L72] fitted with a cell phone device on each \r\n[L73] ear and then underwent two positron \r\n[L74] emission topography, or PET, scans \r\n[L75] to measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\n[L76] During one scan, the cell phones were \r\n[L77] both turned off. During the other \r\n[L78] scan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\n[L79] call was made to the phone on the \r\n[L80] right ear. The order of when the call \r\n[L81] was received (for the first or second \r\n[L82] scan) was randomized. Comparison \r\n[L83] of the PET scans showed a significant \r\n[L84] increase in activity in the part of the \r\n[L85] brain closest to the antenna during \r\n[L86] the transmission of the automated \r\n[L87] call.\r\n[L88] Studies 1 and 3 found potential \r\n[L89] physiological responses to cell \r\n[L90] phone use.

We\u2019ll now learn about such methods, \r\n[L111] study their pros and cons, and see both good and bad ways to use them.

In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L124] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L125] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L126] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L127] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L128] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L129] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L130] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L131] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L132] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L133] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L134] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L135] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L136] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L137] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L138] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L139] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L140] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L141] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L142] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L143] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L144] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L145] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L146] 5HFDOO\r\n[L147] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L148] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L149] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L150] we call the sample.\r\n[L151] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L152] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L153] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L154] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L155] variable. b\r\n[L156] Experimental Study\r\n[L157] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L158] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L159] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L160] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L161] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L162] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories ","[L163] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>","[L164] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L165] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\n[L166] the experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\n[L167] response variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\n[L168] it increased.\r\n[L169] An experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\n[L170] in the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\n[L171] By contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\n[L172] and the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\n[L173] them. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\n[L174] Observational Study\r\n[L175] In an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\n[L176] explanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\n[L177] In short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\n[L178] the study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\n[L179] treatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\n[L180] Identifying experimental \r\n[L181] versus observational \r\n[L182] studies\r\n[L183] b\r\n[L184] Cell Phone Use\r\n[L185] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L186] Example 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\n[L187] between cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body. We\u2019ve \r\n[L188] seen that Study 3 was an experiment.

How were Studies 1 and 2 fundamentally different from Study 3 in \r\n[L193] terms of how the treatments were determined for each subject?\r\n[L194] Think It Through\r\n[L195] a. In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\n[L196] gathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\n[L197] determined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\n[L198] observed this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\n[L199] and 2 were observational studies.\r\n[L200] b. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\n[L201] the subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\n[L202] to both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\n[L203] during the second scan. The researchers imposed the treatments on \r\n[L204] the subjects. So, Study 3 was an experimental study.*\r\n[L205] Example 2 \r\n[L206] *The researchers noted that \u201cResults of this study provide evidence that acute cell phone expo\ufffesure affects brain metabolic activity.

For \r\n[L230] instance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\n[L231] twelfth graders from the two types of schools. In addition, the figure in the \r\n[L232] margin shows the conditional proportions of drug use for these students.\r\n[L233] Questions to Explore\r\n[L234] a.

So this was an ob\ufffeservational study.\r\n[L250] Insight\r\n[L251] An experiment would have assigned schools to use or not use drug testing \r\n[L252] rather than leaving the decision to the schools. For instance, the study could \r\n[L253] have randomly selected half the schools to perform drug testing and half not to \r\n[L254] perform it and then, a year later, measured the student drug use in each school.\r\n[L255] c Try Exercise 4.7","[L256] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://568e66fa8c8c602#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":70436,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L257] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 45>","[L258] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 183\r\n[L259] As we will soon discuss, an experimental study gives the researcher more control \r\n[L260] over outside influences. This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\n[L261] association.\r\n[L262] Advantage of Experiments Over \r\n[L263] Observational\u00a0Studies\r\n[L264] In an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\n[L265] Example 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\n[L266] there could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\n[L267] cancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\n[L268] who do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\n[L269] a possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\n[L270] phones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\n[L271] screens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\n[L272] eye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\n[L273] By contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\n[L274] the results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\n[L275] which subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\n[L276] groups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\n[L277] similar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\n[L278] to have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\n[L279] condition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\n[L280] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L281] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L282] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L283] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L284] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L285] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L286] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L287] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L288] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L289] differences, on the average.\r\n[L290] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L291] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L292] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L293] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L294] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L295] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L296] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L297] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L298] imply causation.\r\n[L299] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L300] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L301] with an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\n[L302] which treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\n[L303] explanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\n[L304] discovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\n[L305] conduct an experiment.\r\n[L306] 5HFDOO\r\n[L307] From Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\n[L308] a variable not observed in the study that \r\n[L309] influences the association between the \r\n[L310] response and explanatory variables due \r\n[L311] to its own association with each of those \r\n[L312] variables. b\r\n[L313] &DXWLRQ\r\n[L314] In Example 3, the problem with the \r\n[L315] conclusion they made is that schools with \r\n[L316] high rates of drug use might be more \r\n[L317] inclined to employ drug tests to address \r\n[L318] the problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\n[L319] tests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n[L320] 0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\n[L321] also conceivable that drug use rates started \r\n[L322] at 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\n[L323] the drug test program. The problem with \r\n[L324] this observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\n[L325] know which of the previous conceivable \r\n[L326] scenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\n[L327] occurred. b","[L328] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>","[L329] 184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L330] Determining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\n[L331] If experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\n[L332] bother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\n[L333] than for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\n[L334] the following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\n[L335] use a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\n[L336] body never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\n[L337] more common for those who used cell phones.\r\n[L338] There are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\n[L339] j It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\n[L340] subjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\n[L341] harmful.\r\n[L342] j It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told. How can \r\n[L343] you monitor them to ensure that they adhere to their treatment assignment \r\n[L344] over the 50-year experimental period?\r\n[L345] j Who wants to wait 50 years to get an answer?\r\n[L346] For these reasons, medical experiments are often performed over a short time \r\n[L347] period or often with exposure to treatments that would not be out of the ordinary \r\n[L348] (such as a one-time exposure to cell phone activity). To measure the effects on \r\n[L349] people of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\n[L350] uses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\n[L351] populations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\n[L352] when we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\n[L353] studies. Then we are not deliberately placing people in harm\u2019s way, but observing \r\n[L354] people who have chosen on their own to take part in the activity of interest. In \r\n[L355] today\u2019s information age, a lot of data is readily available to assist (or impede) \r\n[L356] people from making decisions about the relationship between variables. These \r\n[L357] data provide only observational comparisons. We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\n[L358] good observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\n[L359] experiment is not practical.\r\n[L360] Finally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\n[L361] questions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\n[L362] want to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\n[L363] use a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\n[L364] Using Data Already Available\r\n[L365] Of course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\n[L366] question, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\n[L367] instead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\n[L368] your personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\n[L369] phone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\n[L370] Informal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\n[L371] there is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\n[L372] disprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\n[L373] a pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\n[L374] association does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\n[L375] smoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\n[L376] is lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\n[L377] A famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n[L378] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L379] Examples of sources for available data:\r\n[L380] j General Social Survey (GSS)\r\n[L381] j http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\n[L382] j www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\n[L383] j www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\n[L384] j www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\n[L385] Kingdom)\r\n[L386] j www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)","[L387] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>","[L388] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\n[L389] research studies.

The primary \r\n[L401] danger appears to be people using cell phones while driving!\r\n[L402] Sample Survey\r\n[L403] A sample survey selects a sample of subjects from a population and collects data from \r\n[L404] them. In the field of statistics a survey does not just indicate an opinion poll or a question\ufffenaire; it includes any information gathered from or about the subject.\r\n[L405] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study. The subjects provide data \r\n[L406] on the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\n[L407] Most countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\n[L408] number of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\n[L409] them. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\n[L410] entire population.\r\n[L411] In Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\n[L412] of the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n[L413] 1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\n[L414] more than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\n[L415] the population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\n[L416] j The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\n[L417] census. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\n[L418] seats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\n[L419] on how their population size compares with other states.\r\n[L420] j Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\n[L421] j Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\n[L422] and local communities.\r\n[L423] Although it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\n[L424] practice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\n[L425] census bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient. \r\n[L426] Because data are needed regularly on economic variables, such as the unem\ufffeployment rate, the U.S. Bureau of the Census continually takes samples of the \r\n[L427] population rather than relying solely on the complete census. An example is the \r\n[L428] monthly Current Population Survey, which surveys about 50,000 U.S. house\ufffeholds and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the \r\n[L429] United States, including the unemployment rate. It is usually more practical, in \r\n[L430] terms of time and money, to take a sample rather than to try to measure every\ufffeone in a population.","[L431] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 45>","[L432] 186 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L433] For a sample survey to be informative, it is important for the sample to reflect \r\n[L434] the population well.

A nationwide census is conducted \r\n[L616] in the United States every 10 years.\r\n[L617] a. Give at least two reasons the United States takes a census \r\n[L618] only every 10 years.\r\n[L619] 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\r\n[L620] The sample survey is a common type of nonexperimental study. The first step of \r\n[L621] a sample survey is to define the population targeted by the study. For instance, \r\n[L622] the Gallup organization (www.gallup.com) conducts a monthly survey of about \r\n[L623] 1000 adult Americans. Gallup then reports the percentage of those sampled who \r\n[L624] respond \u201capprove\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way [the \r\n[L625] current president of the United States] is handling his job as president?\u201d If the \r\n[L626] sampling is conducted properly, this provides a good estimate of the approval \r\n[L627] rate within the entire population. The population consists of all adults living in \r\n[L628] the United States.\r\n[L629] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L630] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L631] Sampling Frame\r\n[L632] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L633] taken.\r\n[L634] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L635] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L636] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L637] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L638] of registered students.\r\n[L639] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L640] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L641] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L642] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L643] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L644] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L645] doubtful.\r\n[L646] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L647] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L648] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L649] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L650] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L651] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L652] be misleading.","[L653] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>","[L654] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L655] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L656] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L657] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L658] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L659] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L660] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L661] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L662] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L663] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L664] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L665] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L666] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L667] 5HFDOO\r\n[L668] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L669] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L670] called the sample size. b\r\n[L671] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L672] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L673] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L674] Simple random \r\n[L675] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L676] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L677] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L678] a dinner banquet and raffle. The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\n[L679] of football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\n[L680] everyone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once. (This is \r\n[L681] called sampling without replacement.) To select the two winners, the organiz\ufffeers choose a simple random sample of size n = 2 from the 60 ticket holders. \r\n[L682] Each individual at the banquet receives an entry with a number between 1 and \r\n[L683] 60. Duplicate tickets numbered 1 to 60 are placed in a container and mixed, \r\n[L684] after which the two winning entries are chosen at random. Whoever holds the \r\n[L685] tickets containing the same numbers as those drawn at random wins the foot\ufffeball tickets.\r\n[L686] Questions to Explore\r\n[L687] a. What are the possible samples?\r\n[L688] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 will be drawn?\r\n[L689] c. Professor Shaffer is in attendance at the banquet and holds entry num\ufffeber 1. What is the chance that her entry will be chosen? Mr. Chatterjee \r\n[L690] holds entry number 55. What is the chance that his entry will be chosen?\r\n[L691] Think It Through\r\n[L692] a. The entire collection of possible samples is too long to list, but we can \r\n[L693] visualize the possibilities by listing certain pairs:\r\n[L694] (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), . . . , (1,58), (1,59), (1,60)\r\n[L695] (2,3), (2,4), . . . , (2,58), (2,59), (2,60)\r\n[L696] .\r\n[L697] .\r\n[L698] .\r\n[L699] Example 4 ","[L700] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>","[L701] 190 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L702] Selecting a Simple Random Sample\r\n[L703] What\u2019s a better way to take a simple random sample than blindly drawing slips \r\n[L704] of paper out of a hat? You first number the subjects in the sampling frame. You \r\n[L705] then generate a set of those numbers randomly. Finally, you sample the subjects \r\n[L706] whose numbers were generated. One method of generating numbers randomly \r\n[L707] is to use a random number table. In practice, technology is used to generate the \r\n[L708] sample. This could be an app or a statistical program. The following example \r\n[L709] demonstrates how a random sample is generated in MINITAB (left column).\r\n[L710] Taking a Random Sample Consider taking a random sample of three students \r\n[L711] from a class in which the following students are enrolled: Aisha, Benedict, Chung, \r\n[L712] Diego, Emily, Francisco, Girish, Hank, Isabella, and Jing.\r\n[L713] It can be done in MINITAB, as shown below.\r\n[L714] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L715] The Random Numbers web app from \r\n[L716] the book\u2019s website can also be used to \r\n[L717] generate random numbers. The screenshot \r\n[L718] in the margin next to Example 5 on the next \r\n[L719] page illustrates. b\r\n[L720] (57,58), (57,59), (57,60)\r\n[L721] (58,59), (58,60)\r\n[L722] (59,60)\r\n[L723] b. The first row above contains 59 possible samples, the second row con\ufffetains 58, and so forth. There are thus 59 + 58 + c + 2 + 1, which \r\n[L724] equals 1770 possible samples. The process of randomly selecting two \r\n[L725] unique entries ensures that each possible sample of size 2 has an equal \r\n[L726] chance of occurring. Since there are 1770 possible samples, the chance \r\n[L727] of any one sample being selected is 1 out of 1770.\r\n[L728] c. Looking at the top row in part a, we see that 1 shows up in 59 of the \r\n[L729] samples (all of the samples listed in the top row).

There are better \r\n[L736] ways of selecting simple random samples, as we\u2019ll learn next.\r\n[L737] c Try Exercise 4.16","[L738] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://2a1ab342a4235ad#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60206,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L739] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 45>","[L740] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 191\r\n[L741] When we executed this command in MINITAB, the following random sample \r\n[L742] was obtained. This would be your sample of size 3.\r\n[L743] Note that if you select a random sample, you will not necessarily get the same \r\n[L744] three people.\r\n[L745] Selecting a Simple \r\n[L746] Random Sample b Auditing a School District\r\n[L747] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L748] Local school districts must be prepared for annual visits from state auditors \r\n[L749] whose job is to verify the dollar amount of the accounts within the school \r\n[L750] district and determine whether the money is being spent appropriately. It \r\n[L751] is too time-consuming and expensive for auditors to review all accounts, \r\n[L752] so they typically review only some of them. So that a school district cannot \r\n[L753] anticipate which accounts will be reviewed, the auditors often take a simple \r\n[L754] random sample of the accounts.\r\n[L755] Questions to Explore\r\n[L756] a. How can the auditors use random numbers to select 10 accounts to \r\n[L757] audit in a school district that has 60 accounts?\r\n[L758] b. Why is it important for the auditors not to use personal judgment in \r\n[L759] selecting the accounts to audit?\r\n[L760] Think It Through\r\n[L761] a. The sampling frame consists of the 60 accounts. We first number the \r\n[L762] accounts 1 through 60. Alternatively, they could list the names of the \r\n[L763] accounts. The accounts MINITAB selected (see below for details of \r\n[L764] the process) were 56, 43, 35, 47, 15, 8, 31, 9, 33, and 36. We cannot \r\n[L765] verify that these numbers are randomly selected, but we know that the \r\n[L766] process used to generate them employs random selection.\r\n[L767] b. By using simple random sampling, the auditors hold the school district \r\n[L768] responsible for all accounts. If the auditors personally chose the ac\ufffecounts to audit, they might select certain accounts each year. A school \r\n[L769] district would soon learn which accounts they need to have in order \r\n[L770] and which accounts can be given less attention.\r\n[L771] Insight\r\n[L772] Likewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) randomly selects some tax re\ufffeturns for audit, so taxpayers cannot predict ahead of time whether they will \r\n[L773] be audited. For efficiency, the IRS samples a small proportion of tax returns \r\n[L774] with small amounts owed and a larger proportion of tax returns with high \r\n[L775] amounts owed. It does this because it cares about the total amount of tax \r\n[L776] revenue brought in.\r\n[L777] c Try Exercise 4.17\r\n[L778] Example 5 \r\n[L779] Methods of Collecting Data in Sample Surveys\r\n[L780] In Example 5, the subjects sampled were accounts. More commonly, they are \r\n[L781] people. For any survey, it is difficult to get a good sampling frame since a list of \r\n[L782] all adults in a population typically does not exist. So, it\u2019s necessary to pick a place \r\n[L783] where almost all people can be found\u2014a person\u2019s place of residence.\r\n[L784] Once we identify the desired sample for a survey, how do we contact the \r\n[L785] people to collect the data?

An advantage is that \r\n[L794] subjects are more likely to participate. A disadvantage is the cost. Also, some sub\ufffejects may not answer sensitive questions pertaining to opinions or lifestyle, such \r\n[L795] as alcohol and drug use, whether they have been victims of sexual abuse, or their \r\n[L796] HIV status that they might answer on a printed questionnaire.\r\n[L797] Telephone interview A telephone interview is like a personal interview but \r\n[L798] conducted over the phone. A main advantage is lower cost because no travel is \r\n[L799] involved. A disadvantage is that the interview might have to be short. Subjects \r\n[L800] generally aren\u2019t as patient on the phone and may hang up before starting or com\ufffepleting the interview.\r\n[L801] Self-administered questionnaire Subjects are requested to fill out a questionnaire \r\n[L802] mailed, e-mailed, or otherwise available online. An advantage is that it is cheaper \r\n[L803] than a personal interview. A disadvantage is that fewer people tend to participate.\r\n[L804] So which method is most used? Most major national polls that survey regularly \r\n[L805] to measure public opinion use the telephone interview. An example is the polls \r\n[L806] conducted by the Gallup organization. The General Social Survey is an exception, \r\n[L807] using personal interviews for its questionnaire, which is quite long.\r\n[L808] For telephone interviews, since the mid-1980s, many sample surveys have used \r\n[L809] random digit dialing to select households. The survey can then obtain a sample \r\n[L810] without having a sampling frame. In the United States, typically the area code \r\n[L811] and the 3-digit exchange are randomly selected from the list of all such codes and \r\n[L812] exchanges. Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\n[L813] randomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\n[L814] randomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\n[L815] likely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\n[L816] exactly one telephone?)\r\n[L817] Sources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\n[L818] A variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\n[L819] the population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\n[L820] of the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n[L821] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L822] Besides Gallup, there are other polling \r\n[L823] groups that conduct national surveys, \r\n[L824] such\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\n[L825] people-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n[L826] (www.zogby.com).

The main way \r\n[L836] this occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\n[L837] undercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\n[L838] the population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\n[L839] prison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\n[L840] consists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\n[L841] landlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\n[L842] those who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\n[L843] are in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\n[L844] sampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\n[L845] Nonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\n[L846] cannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\n[L847] subjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\n[L848] in some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\n[L849] issues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\n[L850] questions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\n[L851] suffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\n[L852] telephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\n[L853] nonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\n[L854] only about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\n[L855] contact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\n[L856] Results have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\n[L857] in her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\n[L858] feminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\n[L859] States. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\n[L860] least five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\n[L861] questionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\n[L862] large. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\n[L863] know whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\n[L864] of the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\n[L865] adult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\n[L866] of using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\n[L867] Response bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\n[L868] This is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\n[L869] way, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\n[L870] lie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\n[L871] the response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\n[L872] If you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\n[L873] questions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\n[L874] long, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\n[L875] Roper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II. In response to \r\n[L876] the question, \u201cDoes it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the \r\n[L877] Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?\u201d 22% said it was possible the \r\n[L878] Holocaust never happened. The Roper organization later admitted that the ques\ufffetion was worded in a confusing manner. When it asked, \u201cDoes it seem possible \r\n[L879] to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel \r\n[L880] certain that it happened?\u201d only 1% said it was possible it never happened.4\r\n[L881] Even the order in which questions are asked can dramatically influence re\ufffesults. One study5\r\n[L882]  asked, during the Cold War, \u201cDo you think the U.S. should let \r\n[L883] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L884] There is bias if the way in which \r\n[L885] the study was designed or the \r\n[L886] data were gathered made certain \r\n[L887] outcomes occur more or less often \r\n[L888] in the sample than they do in the \r\n[L889] population. For example, consider \r\n[L890] the population of adults in your \r\n[L891] home town. The results of an opinion \r\n[L892] survey asking about raising the sales \r\n[L893] tax to support public schools may \r\n[L894] be biased in the direction of raising \r\n[L895] taxes if you sample only educators \r\n[L896] or biased in the direction of lowering \r\n[L897] taxes if you sample only business \r\n[L898] owners. Alternatively, the results \r\n[L899] could be biased toward raising taxes \r\n[L900] if a higher proportion of educators \r\n[L901] responded than business owners.\r\n[L902] ,Q3UDFWLFH Be Alert for \r\n[L903] Potential Bias\r\n[L904] With any sample survey, carefully \r\n[L905] scrutinize the results.

Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L932] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L933] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L934] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L935] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L936] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L937] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L938] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L939] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L940] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L941] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L942] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L943] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L944] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L945] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L946] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L947] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L948] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L949] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L950] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L951] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L952] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L953] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L954] than the general population.\r\n[L955] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L956] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L957] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L958] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L959] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L960] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L961] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L962] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L963] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.","[L964] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>","[L965] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L966] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L967] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L968] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L969] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L970] and Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\n[L971] because they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\n[L972] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L973] planned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n[L974] 2.3 million people returned the questionnaire. The Digest predicted that \r\n[L975] Landon would win, getting 57% of the vote. Instead, Landon actually got only \r\n[L976] 36%, and Roosevelt won in a landslide.\r\n[L977] Questions to Explore\r\n[L978] a. What was the population?\r\n[L979] b. How could the Literary Digest poll make such a large error, especially \r\n[L980] with such a huge sample size? What type of bias occurred in this poll?\r\n[L981] Think It Through\r\n[L982] a. The population was all registered voters in the United States in 1936.\r\n[L983] b. This survey had two severe problems:\r\n[L984] j Sampling bias due to undercoverage of the sampling frame and a \r\n[L985] nonrandom sample: In 1936, the United States was in the Great \r\n[L986] Depression. Those who had cars and country club memberships \r\n[L987] and thus received questionnaires tended to be wealthy. The wealthy \r\n[L988] tended to be primarily Republican, the political party of Landon. \r\n[L989] Many potential voters were not on the lists used for the sampling \r\n[L990] frame. There was also no guarantee that a subject in the sampling \r\n[L991] frame was a registered voter.\r\n[L992] j Nonresponse bias: Of the 10 million people who received question\ufffenaires, 7.7 million did not respond. As might be expected, those \r\n[L993] individuals who were unhappy with the incumbent (Roosevelt) were \r\n[L994] more likely to respond.\r\n[L995] Insight\r\n[L996] For this same election, a pollster who was getting his new polling agency off the \r\n[L997] ground surveyed 50,000 people and predicted that Roosevelt would win. Who \r\n[L998] was this pollster? George Gallup. The Gallup organization is still with us today. \r\n[L999] However, the Literary Digest went out of business soon after the 1936 election.6\r\n[L1000] c Try Exercise 4.24\r\n[L1001] Example 6 \r\n[L1002] A Large Sample Size Does Not Guarantee \r\n[L1003] an\u00a0Unbiased Sample\r\n[L1004] Many people think that as long as the sample size is large, it doesn\u2019t matter how \r\n[L1005] the sample was selected.

As another example, consider trying to estimate the \r\n[L1014] average grade point average (GPA) on your campus. If you select 10 students \r\n[L1015] from the library, you can produce an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs \r\n[L1016] (assuming those students who go to the library are studying more than those who \r\n[L1017] don\u2019t). If you, instead, gather a larger sample of 30 students from the library, you \r\n[L1018] still have an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs. The larger sample size \r\n[L1019] did not fix the problem of sampling in the library. Many Internet surveys have \r\n[L1020] thousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\n[L1021] as a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller. We\u2019re almost \r\n[L1022] always better off with a simple random sample of 100 people than with a volunteer \r\n[L1023] sample of thousands of people.\r\n[L1024] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Sample Survey\r\n[L1025] j Identify the population of all the subjects of interest.\r\n[L1026] j Define a sampling frame, which attempts to list all the subjects in the population.\r\n[L1027] j Use a random sampling design, implemented using random numbers, to select n\r\n[L1028] subjects from the sampling frame.\r\n[L1029] j Be cautious about sampling bias due to nonrandom samples (such as volunteer \r\n[L1030] samples) and sample undercoverage, response bias from subjects not giving their \r\n[L1031] true response or from poorly worded questions, and nonresponse bias from refusal \r\n[L1032] of subjects to participate.\r\n[L1033] In Section 4.1 we learned that experimental studies are preferable to nonex\ufffeperimental studies but are not always possible. Some types of nonexperimental \r\n[L1034] studies have fewer potential pitfalls than others. For a sample survey with random \r\n[L1035] sampling, we can make inferences about the population of interest. By contrast, \r\n[L1036] with a study using a convenience sample, results apply only to those subjects actu\ufffeally observed. For this reason, some researchers use the term observational study\r\n[L1037] to refer only to studies that use available subjects (such as a convenience sample) \r\n[L1038] and not to sample surveys that randomly select their sample.\r\n[L1039] 4.15 Choosing officers A campus club consists of five officers: \r\n[L1040] president (P), vice president (V), secretary (S), treasurer \r\n[L1041] (T), and activity coordinator (A). The club can select two \r\n[L1042] officers to travel to New Orleans for a conference; for \r\n[L1043] fairness, they decide to make the selection at random. In \r\n[L1044] essence, they are choosing a simple random sample of size \r\n[L1045] n = 2.\r\n[L1046] a. What are the possible samples of two officers?\r\n[L1047] b.

First, let\u2019s recall the \r\n[L1222] definition of an experimental study from Section 4.1: We assign each subject to an \r\n[L1223] experimental condition, called a treatment. We then observe the outcome on the \r\n[L1224] response variable. The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L1225] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L1226] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L1227] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L1228] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L1229] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L1230] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1231] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L1232] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L1233] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L1234] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L1235] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L1236] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L1237] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L1238] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L1239] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L1240] would like to quit.\r\n[L1241] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L1242] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L1243] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L1244] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L1245]  You need \r\n[L1246] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L1247] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L1248] 8\r\n[L1249] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L1250] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.","[L1251] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>","[L1252] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L1253] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L1254] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L1255] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L1256] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L1257] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L1258] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L1259] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L1260] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L1261] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L1262] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L1263] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L1264] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L1265] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L1266] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L1267] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L1268] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L1269] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\n[L1270] subjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\n[L1271] antidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\n[L1272] control group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n[L1273] 33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\n[L1274] compared to the placebo group.\r\n[L1275] In some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\n[L1276] than a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\n[L1277] an antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\n[L1278] It may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\n[L1279] patch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\n[L1280] a placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\n[L1281] nicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\n[L1282] Randomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\n[L1283] subjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\n[L1284] treatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\n[L1285] the study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\n[L1286] subconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\n[L1287] group that receives the antidepressant.\r\n[L1288] It is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\n[L1289] the 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\n[L1290] control group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\n[L1291] younger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\n[L1292] making them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\n[L1293] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L1294] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L1295] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L1296] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L1297] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L1298] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L1299] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L1300] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L1301] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L1302] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L1303] one treatment.","[L1304] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>","[L1305] 200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1306] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L1307] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L1308] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L1309] An analysis9\r\n[L1310]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L1311] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L1312] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L1313] studies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L1314] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L1315] 9\r\n[L1316] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L1317] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L1318] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L1319] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L1320] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L1321] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L1322] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L1323] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L1324] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L1325] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L1326] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L1327] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L1328] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L1329] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L1330] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L1331] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L1332] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L1333] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1334] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L1335] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L1336] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L1337] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L1338] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L1339] The other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\n[L1340] study observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\n[L1341] Questions to Explore\r\n[L1342] a.

They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\n[L1365] of the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\n[L1366] to the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group). The \r\n[L1367] procedure would be as follows:\r\n[L1368] j Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\n[L1369] j Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\n[L1370] bupropion group.\r\n[L1371] j Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\n[L1372] values between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\n[L1373] will receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n[L1374]  control group.\r\n[L1375] c. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\n[L1376] whether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\n[L1377] sources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\n[L1378] abstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\n[L1379] Insight\r\n[L1380] In the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\n[L1381] year, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\n[L1382] with 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\n[L1383] were not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects. However, after \r\n[L1384] two years, the percentage of nonsmokers was similar for the two groups, 42% \r\n[L1385] versus 40%.\r\n[L1386] c Try Exercise 4.32\r\n[L1387] ,Q3UDFWLFH The Randomized \r\n[L1388] Experiment in Medicine\r\n[L1389] In medicine, the randomized \r\n[L1390] experiment (clinical trial) has become \r\n[L1391] the gold standard for evaluating new \r\n[L1392] medical treatments.

But some studies mistakenly try to generalize \r\n[L1411] to a broader population than the one from which the sample was taken. A psy\ufffechologist may conduct an experiment using a sample of students from an intro\ufffeductory psychology course. For the results to be of wider interest, however, the \r\n[L1412] psychologist might claim that the conclusions generalize to all college students, \r\n[L1413] to all young adults, or even to all adults. Such generalizations may be wrong since \r\n[L1414] the sample may differ from those populations in fundamental ways such as in \r\n[L1415] average socioeconomic status, race, or gender, or attitudes.\r\n[L1416] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1417] j A good experiment has a control comparison group, randomization in assigning \r\n[L1418] experimental units to treatments, and blinding.\r\n[L1419] j The experimental units are the subjects\u2014the people, animals, or other objects to \r\n[L1420] which the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1421] j The treatments are the experimental conditions imposed on the experimental \r\n[L1422] units. One of these may be a control (for instance, either a placebo or an existing \r\n[L1423] treatment) that provides a basis for determining whether a particular treatment is \r\n[L1424] effective. The treatments correspond to values of an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1425] j Randomly assign the experimental units to the treatments. This tends to balance \r\n[L1426] the comparison groups with respect to lurking variables.\r\n[L1427] j Replication of studies increases confidence in the conclusions.\r\n[L1428] Carefully assess the scope of conclusions in research articles, mass media, and \r\n[L1429] advertisements.

A team of researchers stud\ufffeied whether typing text messages, reading them, or a combi\ufffenation of both, while driving affect eye movements, stimulus \r\n[L1563] detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed \r\n[L1564] and headway significantly. A total sample of 977 participants \r\n[L1565] from 28 experimental studies was considered in the investi\ufffegation. Results show that typing and reading text messages \r\n[L1566] while driving adversely affected driver control ability.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\n[L1585] extended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\n[L1586] alternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\n[L1587] of observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\n[L1588] with humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\n[L1589] or more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\n[L1590] Sample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\n[L1591] Designs\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\n[L1592] Simple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\n[L1593] In practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\n[L1594] or are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\n[L1595] Sometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\n[L1596] Cluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\n[L1597] frame\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\n[L1598] information is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\n[L1599] study of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\n[L1600] students can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\n[L1601] observing each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\n[L1602] For instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\n[L1603] your city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\n[L1604] city blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\n[L1605] then select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\n[L1606] Cluster Random Sample\r\n[L1607] Divide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\n[L1608] random sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\n[L1609] cluster random sample.\r\n[L1610] For personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\n[L1611] sampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\n[L1612] many observations quickly and with little travel.\r\n[L1613] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\n[L1614] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1615] Cluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\n[L1616] j A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\n[L1617] j The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\n[L1618] The disadvantages are:\r\n[L1619] j We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\n[L1620] of precision.\r\n[L1621] j Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.","[L1622] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>","[L1623] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\n[L1624] Stratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\n[L1625] number of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement. The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L1626] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L1627] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L1628] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L1629] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L1630] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L1631] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L1632] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L1633] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L1634] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L1635] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L1636] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L1637] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\n[L1638] each subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\n[L1639] in your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\n[L1640] students who work and who don\u2019t work. However, this information may not be \r\n[L1641] available for each student.\r\n[L1642] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Stratified \r\n[L1643] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1644] Stratified random sampling has the\r\n[L1645] j Advantage that you can include in your sample enough subjects in each group \r\n[L1646] (stratum) you want to evaluate.\r\n[L1647] j Disadvantage that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into \r\n[L1648] which each subject belongs.\r\n[L1649] What\u2019s the difference between a stratified sample and a cluster sample? A \r\n[L1650] stratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L1651] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L1652] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L1653] random sample).\r\n[L1654] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L1655] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L1656] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L1657] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L1658] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L1659] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L1660] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L1661] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L1662] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L1663] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L1664] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of ","[L1665] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>","[L1666] 206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1667] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L1668] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L1669] be infeasible.\r\n[L1670] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L1671] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L1672] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L1673] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L1674] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L1675] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L1676] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L1677] sampling. Similar formulas exist for other types of random sampling, but they are \r\n[L1678] complex and beyond the scope of this text.\r\n[L1679] Table 4.1 Summary of Random Sampling Methods\r\n[L1680] Method Description Advantages\r\n[L1681] Simple random \r\n[L1682] sample\r\n[L1683] Each possible sample is equally \r\n[L1684] likely\r\n[L1685] Sample tends to be a good \r\n[L1686] reflection of the population\r\n[L1687] Cluster random \r\n[L1688] sample\r\n[L1689] Identify clusters of subjects, \r\n[L1690] take\u00a0simple random sample \r\n[L1691] of the clusters\r\n[L1692] Do not need a sampling frame \r\n[L1693] of subjects, less expensive to \r\n[L1694] implement\r\n[L1695] Stratified random \r\n[L1696] sample\r\n[L1697] Divide population into groups \r\n[L1698] (strata), take simple random \r\n[L1699]  sample from each stratum\r\n[L1700] Ensures enough subjects in each \r\n[L1701] group that you want to compare\r\n[L1702] m Figure 4.2 Ways of Randomly Sampling 40 Students.

With an observational study, it\u2019s possible that an association \r\n[L1714] is due to some lurking variable. However, observational studies do have advan\ufffetages. It\u2019s often not practical to conduct an experiment. For instance, with human \r\n[L1715] subjects it\u2019s not ethical to design an experiment to study the long-term effect of \r\n[L1716] cell phone use on getting cancer. Nevertheless, it is possible to design an observa\ufffetional study that controls for identified lurking variables.\r\n[L1717] Rather than taking a cross section of a population at some time, such as with \r\n[L1718] a sample survey, some studies are backward looking (retrospective) or forward \r\n[L1719] looking (prospective). Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\n[L1720] How can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\n[L1721] use and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\n[L1722] of subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\n[L1723] and then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups. This approach \r\n[L1724] was first applied to study smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1725] Retrospective \r\n[L1726] studies b Lung Cancer and Smoking\r\n[L1727] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1728] In 1950 in London, England, medical statisticians Austin Bradford Hill and \r\n[L1729] Richard Doll conducted one of the first studies linking smoking and lung cancer. \r\n[L1730] In 20 hospitals, they matched 709 patients admitted with lung cancer in the pre\ufffeceding year with 709 noncancer patients at the same hospital of the same gender \r\n[L1731] and within the same five-year grouping on age. All patients were queried about \r\n[L1732] their smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\n[L1733] least one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\n[L1734] to look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\n[L1735] Table 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\n[L1736] were the patients with lung cancer. The 709 controls in the second column \r\n[L1737] were the matched patients without lung cancer.\r\n[L1738] Example 8 \r\n[L1739] Table 4.2 Results of Retrospective Study of Smoking and Lung Cancer\r\n[L1740] The cases had lung cancer.

The lung \r\n[L1757] cancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\n[L1758] Insight\r\n[L1759] An inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\n[L1760] This suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1761] c Try Exercise 4.46\r\n[L1762] Case-Control Study\r\n[L1763] A case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\n[L1764] a\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\n[L1765] outcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1766] This is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\n[L1767] ethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\n[L1768] smoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\n[L1769] potential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\n[L1770] variables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\n[L1771] and hospital.\r\n[L1772] In a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\n[L1773] fixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\n[L1774] For instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\n[L1775] time to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\n[L1776] the explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\n[L1777] or control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\n[L1778] subjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\n[L1779] half the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\n[L1780] had lung cancer.\r\n[L1781] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L1782] In Example 8, the response \r\n[L1783] outcome of interest was having lung \r\n[L1784] cancer. The cases had lung cancer, \r\n[L1785] the controls did not have lung \r\n[L1786] cancer, and they were compared on \r\n[L1787] the explanatory variable\u2014whether \r\n[L1788] the subject had been a smoker \r\n[L1789] (yes\u00a0or no).\r\n[L1790] Case-control \r\n[L1791] studies b Cell Phone Use\r\n[L1792] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1793] Studies 1 and 2 about cell phone use in Example 1 were both case-control \r\n[L1794] studies. In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\n[L1795] randomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\n[L1796] cases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\n[L1797] eye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\n[L1798] subjects with the cases.\r\n[L1799] Question to Explore\r\n[L1800] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L1801] such as age?\r\n[L1802] Example 9 ","[L1803] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>","[L1804] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\n[L1805] Prospective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\n[L1806] into the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\n[L1807] Think It Through\r\n[L1808] We\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\n[L1809] such as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\n[L1810] were observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\n[L1811] researchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\n[L1812] variables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\n[L1813] provides.\r\n[L1814] When researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\n[L1815] relationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\n[L1816] is not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\n[L1817] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1818] Insight\r\n[L1819] The lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\n[L1820] the two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\n[L1821] finding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\n[L1822] to be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\n[L1823] users of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\n[L1824] c Try Exercise 4.47\r\n[L1825] Prospective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\n[L1826] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1827] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\n[L1828] began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years. The purpose of \r\n[L1829] the study was to explore relationships among diet, hormonal factors, smok\ufffeing habits, and exercise habits, and the risk of coronary heart disease, pul\ufffemonary disease, and stroke. Since the initial survey in 1976, the nurses have \r\n[L1830] filled out a questionnaire every two years.\r\n[L1831] Question to Explore\r\n[L1832] What does it mean for this observational study to be called prospective?\r\n[L1833] Think It Through\r\n[L1834] The retrospective smoking study in Example 8 looked to the past to learn \r\n[L1835] whether its lung cancer subjects had been smokers. By contrast, at the start \r\n[L1836] of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\n[L1837] would eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer. The study followed \r\n[L1838] each nurse into the future to see whether she developed that outcome and \r\n[L1839] to analyze whether certain explanatory variables (such as smoking) were \r\n[L1840] associated with it.\r\n[L1841] Example 10 \r\n[L1842] 11More information on this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00005152 and at \r\n[L1843] www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs.","[L1844] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://9817beec834ef81#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":69393,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1845] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 45>","[L1846] 210 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1847] Observational Studies and Causation\r\n[L1848] Can we ever definitively establish causation with an observational study? No, we \r\n[L1849] cannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\n[L1850] was observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\n[L1851] have caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\n[L1852] smoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\n[L1853] conducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\n[L1854] time, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\n[L1855] of lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\n[L1856] retrospective and prospective, have added more evidence. For example, when a \r\n[L1857] prospective study begun in 1951 with 35,000 doctors ended in 2001, researchers12\r\n[L1858] estimated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who \r\n[L1859] never quit. This study estimated that at least half the people who smoke from \r\n[L1860] youth are eventually killed by their habit.\r\n[L1861] Most important, studies carried out on different populations of people have \r\n[L1862] consistently concluded that smoking is associated with lung cancer, even after ad\ufffejusting for all potentially confounding variables that researchers have suggested. \r\n[L1863] As more studies are done that adjust for confounding variables, the chance that a \r\n[L1864] lurking variable remains that can explain the association is reduced. As a conse\ufffequence, although we cannot definitively conclude that smoking causes lung can\ufffecer, physicians will not hesitate to tell you that they believe it does.

First, we\u2019ll learn \r\n[L1868] how a single experiment can help us analyze the effects of two explanatory vari\ufffeables at once.\r\n[L1869] Categorical explanatory variables in an experiment are often referred to as \r\n[L1870] factors. For example, consider the experiment described in Example 7 to study \r\n[L1871] whether taking an antidepressant can help a smoker stop smoking. The factor \r\n[L1872] Insight\r\n[L1873] Over the years, several analyses have been conducted using data from \r\n[L1874] the Nurses\u2019 Health Study. One finding (reported in The New York Times, \r\n[L1875] February 11, 2003) was that nurses in this study who were highly overweight \r\n[L1876] 18-year-olds were five times as likely as young women of normal weight to \r\n[L1877] need hip replacement later in life.\r\n[L1878] c Try Exercise 4.48\r\n[L1879] SUMMARY: Types of Nonexperimental Studies\r\n[L1880] j A retrospective study looks into the past.\r\n[L1881] j A prospective study identifies a group (cohort) of people and observes them in \r\n[L1882] the future.

The experiment could then have four treatment \r\n[L1899] groups that result from cross-classifying the two factors. See Figure 4.3.

Why not do one experiment \r\n[L1924] about bupropion and a separate experiment about the nicotine patch? The rea\ufffeson is that we can learn more from a two-factor experiment. For instance, the \r\n[L1925] combination of using both a nicotine patch and bupropion may be more effective \r\n[L1926] than using either method alone.\r\n[L1927] Multifactor \r\n[L1928] experiments b Antidepressants and/or Nicotine Patches\r\n[L1929] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1930] Example 7 analyzed a study about whether bupropion helps a smoker quit \r\n[L1931] cigarettes.

Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L2005] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L2006] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L2007] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L2008] applied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\n[L2009] can\u2019t use many fields.\r\n[L2010] Blocking in an Experiment\r\n[L2011] The matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements. The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\n[L2012] The crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\n[L2013] In experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\n[L2014] to as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\n[L2015] within blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\n[L2016] study, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\n[L2017] so they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\n[L2018] To reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\n[L2019] In the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\n[L2020] be randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\n[L2021] effect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\n[L2022] the second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\n[L2023] assigned to the plots in a field.\r\n[L2024] culprit. They were also pioneers in developing a sound theo\uffferetical basis for the case-control method. They followed their \r\n[L2025] initial study with other case-control studies and with a long-term \r\n[L2026] prospective study that showed that smoking was not only the \r\n[L2027] predominant risk factor for lung cancer but also correlated with \r\n[L2028] other diseases.\r\n[L2029] At first, Bradford Hill was cautious about claiming that \r\n[L2030] smoking causes lung cancer. As the evidence mounted from \r\n[L2031] various studies, he accepted the causal link as being overwhelm\ufffeingly the most likely explanation. An influential article written \r\n[L2032] by Bradford Hill in 1965 proposed criteria that should be sat\ufffeisfied before you conclude that an association reflects a causal \r\n[L2033] link. For his work, in 1961 Austin Bradford Hill was knighted by \r\n[L2034] Queen Elizabeth. Richard Doll was knighted in 1971.\r\n[L2035] In the mid-20th century, Austin Bradford Hill was Britain\u2019s \r\n[L2036] leading medical statistician. In 1946, to assess the effect of strep\ufffetomycin in treating pulmonary tuberculosis, he designed what is \r\n[L2037] now regarded as the first controlled randomized medical exper\ufffeiment. About that time, doctors noticed the alarming increase \r\n[L2038] in the number of lung cancer cases. The cause was unknown \r\n[L2039] but suspected to be atmospheric pollution, particularly coal \r\n[L2040] smoke. In 1950, Bradford Hill and medical doctor and epidemi\ufffeologist Richard Doll published results of the case-control study \r\n[L2041] (Example 8) that identified smoking as a potentially important \r\n[L2042] How did statisticians become pioneers \r\n[L2043] in examining the effects of\u00a0smoking on \r\n[L2044] lung cancer?\r\n[L2045] On the Shoulders of. . .Austin Bradford Hill (1897\u20131991) \r\n[L2046] and Richard Doll (1912\u20132005) ","[L2047] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 36 / 45>","[L2048] 214 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L2049] 4.42 Student loan debt A researcher wants to compare \r\n[L2050]  student loan debt for students who attend four-year public \r\n[L2051] universities with those who attend four-year private uni\ufffeversities.

The sports website ESPN.com asked visitors \r\n[L2289] of the site which team would win the Southeast region. \r\n[L2290] CHAPTER SUMMARY \r\n[L2291] This chapter introduced methods for gathering data.\r\n[L2292] j An experiment assigns subjects to experimental conditions (such \r\n[L2293] as drug or placebo) called treatments. These are categories of \r\n[L2294] the explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\n[L2295] is then observed for each subject.\r\n[L2296] j An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\n[L2297] that observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\n[L2298] observes rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\n[L2299] Since association does not imply causation, with observational \r\n[L2300] studies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\n[L2301] influence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\n[L2302] randomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\n[L2303] to the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\n[L2304] variables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\n[L2305] causation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\n[L2306] with neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\n[L2307] treatment a subject was assigned.\r\n[L2308] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\n[L2309] a sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\n[L2310] incorporate random sampling.\r\n[L2311] j A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\n[L2312] in which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\n[L2313] being selected.\r\n[L2314] j A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\n[L2315] clusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\n[L2316] as the sample.\r\n[L2317] j A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\n[L2318] groups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\n[L2319] from each stratum.\r\n[L2320] Be cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\n[L2321] such as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\n[L2322] random sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\n[L2323] nonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\n[L2324] are biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\n[L2325] Most sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\n[L2326] with many experiments. Medical studies often use retrospective\r\n[L2327] observational studies, which look at subjects\u2019 behavior in the past.\r\n[L2328] j A case-control study is an example of a retrospective study. \r\n[L2329] Subjects who have a response outcome of interest, such as \r\n[L2330] cancer, serve as cases. Other subjects not having that outcome \r\n[L2331] serve as controls. The cases and controls are compared on an \r\n[L2332] explanatory variable, such as whether they had been smokers.\r\n[L2333] A categorical explanatory variable in an experiment is also called a \r\n[L2334] factor. Multifactor experiments have at least two explanatory vari\ufffeables. With a completely randomized design, subjects are assigned \r\n[L2335] randomly to categories of each explanatory variable. Some designs \r\n[L2336] instead use blocks\u2014sets of experimental units that are matched. \r\n[L2337] Matched-pairs designs have two observations in each block. Often \r\n[L2338] this is the same subject observed for each of two treatments, such as \r\n[L2339] in a crossover study.\r\n[L2340] Data are only as good as the method used to obtain them. \r\n[L2341] Unless we use a good study design, conclusions may be faulty.","[L2342] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 45>","[L2343] Chapter Problems 217\r\n[L2344] c.

Meanwhile, the \r\n[L2641] percentage of the population who has tried marijuana \r\n[L2642] has increased dramatically in the United States over the \r\n[L2643] past 50 years, whereas the percentage of the population \r\n[L2644] affected by schizophrenia has remained constant at about \r\n[L2645] 1%.

When patients enrolling in the study are told the \r\n[L2685]  purpose of the study, explain why they may be reluc\ufffetant to be randomly assigned to one of the treatments.\r\n[L2686] c. If a researcher planning the study thinks the new treat\ufffement is likely to be better, explain why he or she may \r\n[L2687] have an ethical dilemma in proceeding with the study.\r\n[L2688] 4.92 Compare smokers with nonsmokers Example 8 and \r\n[L2689] Table 4.2 described a case-control study on smoking and \r\n[L2690] lung cancer. Explain carefully why it is not sensible to use \r\n[L2691] the study\u2019s proportion of smokers who had lung cancer \r\n[L2692] (that is, 688> 1688 + 6502) and proportion of nonsmokers \r\n[L2693] who had lung cancer 121> 121 + 5922 to estimate corre\ufffesponding proportions of smokers and nonsmokers who \r\n[L2694] have lung cancer in the overall population.\r\n[L2695] 4.93 Is a vaccine effective? A vaccine is claimed to be \r\n[L2696]  effective in preventing a rare disease that occurs in about \r\n[L2697] one of every 100,000 people. Explain why a randomized \r\n[L2698] clinical trial comparing 100 people who get the vaccine \r\n[L2699] to 100 people who do not get it is unlikely to be worth \r\n[L2700] doing.

Explain.\r\n[L2709] 4.86 Judging sampling design In each of the following situa\ufffetions, summarize negative aspects of the sample design.\r\n[L2710] a. A newspaper asks readers to vote at its Internet \r\n[L2711] site to determine whether they believe government \r\n[L2712] expenditures should be reduced by cutting social \r\n[L2713]  programs. Based on 1434 votes, the newspaper \r\n[L2714]  reports that 93% of the city\u2019s residents believe that \r\n[L2715] social programs should be reduced.\r\n[L2716] b. A congresswoman reports that letters to her office are \r\n[L2717] running 3 to 1 in opposition to the passage of stricter \r\n[L2718] gun control laws. She concludes that approximately 75% \r\n[L2719] of her constituents oppose stricter gun control laws.\r\n[L2720] c. An anthropology professor wants to compare attitudes \r\n[L2721] toward premarital sex of physical science majors and \r\n[L2722] social science majors. She administers a question\ufffenaire to her Anthropology 437, Comparative Human \r\n[L2723] Sexuality class. She finds no appreciable difference in \r\n[L2724] attitudes between the two majors, so she concludes \r\n[L2725] that the two student groups are about the same in their \r\n[L2726] views about premarital sex.\r\n[L2727] d. A questionnaire is mailed to a simple random sample \r\n[L2728] of 500 household addresses in a city. Ten are returned as \r\n[L2729] bad addresses, 63 are returned completed, and the rest \r\n[L2730] are not returned. The researcher analyzes the 63\u00a0cases \r\n[L2731] and reports that they represent a \u201csimple random \r\n[L2732]  sample of city households.\u201d\r\n[L2733] 4.87 More poor sampling designs Repeat the previous exercise \r\n[L2734] for the following scenarios:\r\n[L2735] a. A principal in a large high school wants to sample \r\n[L2736]  student attitudes toward a proposal that seniors must \r\n[L2737] pass a general achievement test to graduate. She lists all \r\n[L2738] of the first-period classes. Then, using a random num\ufffeber table, she chooses a class at random and interviews \r\n[L2739] every student in that class about the proposed test.\r\n[L2740] b. A new restaurant opened in January. In June, after \r\n[L2741] six months of operation, the owner applied for a loan \r\n[L2742] to improve the building. The loan application asked \r\n[L2743] for the annual gross income of the business. The \r\n[L2744] owner\u2019s record book contains receipts for each day \r\n[L2745] of operation since opening. She decides to calculate \r\n[L2746] the average daily receipt based on a sample of the \r\n[L2747] daily records and multiply that by the number of days \r\n[L2748] of operation in a year. She samples every Friday\u2019s \r\n[L2749] record. The average daily receipt for this sample was \r\n[L2750] then used to estimate the yearly receipts.\r\n[L2751] 4.88 Age for legal alcohol You want to investigate the opin\ufffeions students at your school have about whether the age \r\n[L2752] for legal drinking of alcohol should be 18.\r\n[L2753] a. Write a question to ask about this in a sample survey \r\n[L2754] in such a way that results would be biased.

This result suggests it is better not to use randomiza\ufffetion in medical studies because it is harder to show \r\n[L2759] that new ideas are beneficial.\r\n[L2760] b. Some newspaper articles that suggest a particular food, \r\n[L2761] drug, or environmental agent is harmful or beneficial \r\n[L2762] should be viewed skeptically unless we learn more \r\n[L2763] about the statistical design and analysis for the study.\r\n[L2764] c. This result shows the value of case-control studies \r\n[L2765] over randomized studies.\r\n[L2766] d. The randomized studies were poorly conducted, \r\n[L2767] or\u00a0they would have found the new treatment to be \r\n[L2768] better much more than 9% of the time.\r\n[L2769] 4.99 Multiple choice: Opinion and question wording \r\n[L2770] A recent General Social Survey asked subjects whether \r\n[L2771] they supported legalized abortion in each of seven cir\ufffecumstances. The percentage who supported legalization \r\n[L2772] varied between 44.6% (if the woman is not married) to \r\n[L2773] 88.6% (if the woman\u2019s health is seriously endangered \r\n[L2774] by the pregnancy). This indicates that\r\n[L2775] a. Responses can depend greatly on the question \r\n[L2776] wording.\r\n[L2777] b. Nonexperimental studies can never be trusted.\r\n[L2778] c. The sample must not have been randomly selected.\r\n[L2779] d. The sample must have had problems with response bias.\r\n[L2780] 4.100 Multiple choice: Campaign funding When the \r\n[L2781] Yankelovich polling organization asked, \u201cShould laws \r\n[L2782] be passed to eliminate all possibilities of special interests \r\n[L2783] giving huge sums of money to candidates?\u201d 80% of the \r\n[L2784] sample answered yes. When they posed the question, \r\n[L2785] \u201cShould laws be passed to prohibit interest groups from \r\n[L2786] contributing to campaigns, or do groups have a right to \r\n[L2787] contribute to the candidate they support?\u201d only 40% said \r\n[L2788] yes (Source: A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper, by \r\n[L2789] J.

Each infant in the study was shown two \r\n[L2813] videos. One video included a figure performing a help\ufffeing action and the other included a figure performing a \r\n[L2814] hindering action. Infants were presented with two toys \r\n[L2815] resembling the helping and hindering figures from the \r\n[L2816] videos and allowed to choose one of the toys to play with. \r\n[L2817] The researchers conjectured that, even at a very young \r\n[L2818] age, the infants would tend to choose the helpful object.\r\n[L2819] a. How might the results of this study been biased had \r\n[L2820] each infant been shown the video with the helpful figure \r\n[L2821] before being shown the video with the hindering figure?\r\n[L2822] b. How could such a potential bias be eliminated?\r\n[L2823] 4.95 Distinguish helping and hindering among infants, \r\n[L2824]  continued In the previous exercise, we considered how \r\n[L2825] showing each baby in the study the two videos in the \r\n[L2826] same order might create a bias. In fact, of the 16 babies \r\n[L2827] in the study, half were shown the videos in one order \r\n[L2828] while the other half was shown the videos in the opposite \r\n[L2829]  order. Explain how to use the Random Numbers web app \r\n[L2830] to randomly divide the 16 infants into two groups of 8.\r\n[L2831] 4.96 Distinguish helping and hindering among infants, \r\n[L2832]  continued Fourteen of the 16 infants in the Yale study \r\n[L2833] elected to play with a toy resembling the helpful figure as \r\n[L2834] opposed to one resembling the hindering figure. Is this \r\n[L2835] convincing evidence that infants tend to prefer the helpful \r\n[L2836] figure? Use the Random Numbers web app on the book\u2019s \r\n[L2837] website to investigate the approximate likelihood of the \r\n[L2838] observed results of 14 out of 16 infants choosing the help\ufffeful figure, if in fact infants are indifferent between the two \r\n[L2839] figures.

(Hint: When you sample \r\n[L2880] individuals, explain why you are more likely to sample \r\n[L2881] a large family than a small family.

Capture\u2013 \r\n[L2888] recapture is one method for doing this. A biologist \r\n[L2889] wants to count the deer population in a certain region. \r\n[L2890] She captures 50 deer, tags each, and then releases them. \r\n[L2891] Several weeks later, she captures 125 deer and finds \r\n[L2892] that 12 of them were tagged. Let N = population size,\r\n[L2893] M = size of first sample, n = size of second sample, \r\n[L2894] R = number tagged in second sample.

It states that \u201cresearch \r\n[L2905] for the Bar found that over 40 percent of female junior \r\n[L2906] tenants said they had encountered sexual harassment \r\n[L2907] during their time at the Bar.\u201d This was based on a study \r\n[L2908] conducted at the University of Sheffield that sent a \r\n[L2909] questionnaire to 334 junior tenants at the Bar, of whom \r\n[L2910] 159 responded. Of the 159, 67 were female. Of those \r\n[L2911] females, 3 said they had experienced sexual harassment \r\n[L2912] as a major problem, and 24 had experienced it as a slight \r\n[L2913] problem.\r\n[L2914] a. The quoted statement might be misleading because \r\n[L2915] the nonresponse was large.\r\n[L2916] b. No one was forced to respond, so everyone had a \r\n[L2917] chance to be in the sample, which implies it was a \r\n[L2918] simple random sample.\r\n[L2919] c. This was an example of a completely randomized \r\n[L2920]  experiment, with whether a female junior tenant \r\n[L2921]  experienced sexual harassment as the response \r\n[L2922] variable.\r\n[L2923] d. This was a retrospective case-control study, with those \r\n[L2924] who received sexual harassment as the cases.\r\n[L2925] 4.103 Multiple choice: Effect of response categories A study \r\n[L2926] (N.

When the possible \r\n[L2929] responses were the six categories (up to 1\r\n[L2930] 2 hour, 1\r\n[L2931] 2 to 1 hour, \r\n[L2932] 1 to 11\r\n[L2933] 2 hours, . . . , more than 21\r\n[L2934] 2 hours), 16% of respondents \r\n[L2935] said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2936] 2 hours per day. When the \r\n[L2937] six categories were (up to 21\r\n[L2938] 2 hours, 21\r\n[L2939] 2 to 3 hours, . . . , more \r\n[L2940] than 4 hours), 38% said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2941] 2 hours \r\n[L2942] per day.\r\n[L2943] a. The samples could not have been random, or this \r\n[L2944] would not have happened.\r\n[L2945] b. This shows the importance of question design, especially \r\n[L2946] when people may be uncertain what the answer to the \r\n[L2947] question really is.\r\n[L2948] c. This study was an experiment, not an observational \r\n[L2949] study.\r\n[L2950] 4.104 Systematic sampling A researcher wants to select 1% of \r\n[L2951] the 10,000 subjects from the sampling frame. She selects \r\n[L2952] subjects by picking one of the first 100 on the list at ran\ufffedom, skipping 100 names to get the next subject, skipping \r\n[L2953] another 100 names to get the next subject, and so on. \r\n[L2954] This is called a systematic random sample.\r\n[L2955] a. With simple random sampling, (i) every subject is equally \r\n[L2956] likely to be chosen, and (ii) every possible sample of size \r\n[L2957] n is equally likely. Indicate which, if any, of (i) and (ii) \r\n[L2958] are true for systematic random samples. Explain.\r\n[L2959] In First Sample?\r\n[L2960] Yes (tagged) No (not tagged) Total\r\n[L2961] In Second Yes R n\r\n[L2962] Sample? No\r\n[L2963] Total M N\r\n[L2964] a. Identify the values of M, n, and R for the biologist\u2019s \r\n[L2965] experiment.\r\n[L2966] b. One way to estimate N lets the sample proportion of \r\n[L2967] tagged deer equal the population proportion of tagged \r\n[L2968] deer. Explain why this means that\r\n[L2969] R\r\n[L2970] n = M\r\n[L2971] N\r\n[L2972] and, hence, that the estimated population size is \r\n[L2973] N = 1M * n2 >R\r\n[L2974] c. Estimate the number of deer in the deer population \r\n[L2975] using the numbers given.\r\n[L2976] d. The U.S. Bureau of the Census uses capture\u2013recapture \r\n[L2977] to make adjustments to the census by estimating the \r\n[L2978] undercount. The capture phase is the census itself \r\n[L2979] (persons are \u201ctagged\u201d by having returned their census \r\n[L2980] form and being recorded as counted), and the recap\ufffeture phase (the second sample) is the postenumerative \r\n[L2981] survey (PES) conducted after the census.

Pour the Cheddar Goldfish into \r\n[L2990] a paper bag, which represents the pond. Sample 10 of \r\n[L2991] them. For this initial sample, use Pretzel Goldfish to \r\n[L2992] replace them, to represent the tagged fish. Then select a \r\n[L2993] second sample and derive an estimate for N, the number \r\n[L2994] of Cheddar Goldfish in the original bag.

A particular value of center is \r\n[L3007] the mean area of the states. A map and a list of the states \r\n[L3008] with their areas (in square miles) are shown in the figure \r\n[L3009] and table that follow. Area for a state includes dry land \r\n[L3010] and permanent inland water surface.\r\n[L3011] Although we could use these data to calculate the actual \r\n[L3012] mean area, let\u2019s explore how well sampling performs \r\n[L3013] in estimating the mean area by sampling five states and \r\n[L3014] finding the sample mean.\r\n[L3015] a. The most convenient sampling design is to use our \r\n[L3016] eyes to pick five states from the map that we think \r\n[L3017] have areas representative of all the states. Do this, \r\n[L3018] picking five states that you believe have areas rep\uffferesentative of the actual mean area of the states. \r\n[L3019] Compute their sample mean area.\r\n[L3020] b.

Cell \r\n[L42] phones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\n[L43] main source of this energy. The closer \r\n[L44] the antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\n[L45] greater the exposure to radiation. \r\n[L46] With the increased use of cell phones, \r\n[L47] there has been a growing concern \r\n[L48] over the potential health risks. Several \r\n[L49] studies have explored the possibility \r\n[L50] of such risks:\r\n[L51] Study 1 A German study (Stang \r\n[L52] et\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\n[L53] with a rare form of eye cancer called \r\n[L54] uveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n[L55]  patients who did not have this eye \r\n[L56] cancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\n[L57] was measured using a questionnaire. \r\n[L58] On average, the eye cancer patients \r\n[L59] used cell phones more often.\r\n[L60] Study 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\n[L61] et al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\n[L62] with brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\n[L63] without brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\n[L64] cell phone use was measured using a \r\n[L65] questionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\n[L66] two groups was similar.\r\n[L67] Study 3 A study published in The \r\n[L68] Journal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\n[L69] that cell phone use speeds up activity \r\n[L70] in the brain. As part of a randomized \r\n[L71] crossover study, 47 participants were \r\n[L72] fitted with a cell phone device on each \r\n[L73] ear and then underwent two positron \r\n[L74] emission topography, or PET, scans \r\n[L75] to measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\n[L76] During one scan, the cell phones were \r\n[L77] both turned off. During the other \r\n[L78] scan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\n[L79] call was made to the phone on the \r\n[L80] right ear. The order of when the call \r\n[L81] was received (for the first or second \r\n[L82] scan) was randomized. Comparison \r\n[L83] of the PET scans showed a significant \r\n[L84] increase in activity in the part of the \r\n[L85] brain closest to the antenna during \r\n[L86] the transmission of the automated \r\n[L87] call.\r\n[L88] Studies 1 and 3 found potential \r\n[L89] physiological responses to cell \r\n[L90] phone use.

We \r\n[L106] described shape, center, and variability, looked for patterns and unusual observa\ufffetions, and explored associations between variables. For these and other statistical \r\n[L107] analyses to be useful, we must have \u201cgood data.\u201d But what\u2019s the best way to \r\n[L108] gather data to ensure they are \u201cgood\u201d? The studies described in Example 1 used \r\n[L109] two methods. The first two studies merely observed subjects, whereas the third \r\n[L110] study conducted an experiment with them. We\u2019ll now learn about such methods, \r\n[L111] study their pros and cons, and see both good and bad ways to use them. This will \r\n[L112] help us understand when we can trust the conclusions of a study and when we \r\n[L113] need to be skeptical.\r\n[L114] 2. Is the study ethically feasible?\r\n[L115] 3. How can you design the study \r\n[L116] to be efficient?\r\n[L117] 4. What types of biases or lurking \r\n[L118] variables might exist?\r\n[L119] Thinking Ahead\r\n[L120] A knowledge of different study de\ufffesigns for gathering data helps us un\ufffederstand how contradictory results \r\n[L121] can happen in scientific research \r\n[L122] studies and determine which studies \r\n[L123] deserve our trust. In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L124] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L125] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L126] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L127] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L128] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L129] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L130] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L131] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L132] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L133] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L134] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L135] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L136] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L137] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L138] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L139] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L140] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L141] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L142] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L143] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L144] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L145] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L146] 5HFDOO\r\n[L147] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L148] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L149] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L150] we call the sample.\r\n[L151] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L152] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L153] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L154] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L155] variable. b\r\n[L156] Experimental Study\r\n[L157] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L158] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L159] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L160] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L161] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L162] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories ","[L163] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>","[L164] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L165] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\n[L166] the experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\n[L167] response variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\n[L168] it increased.\r\n[L169] An experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\n[L170] in the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\n[L171] By contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\n[L172] and the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\n[L173] them. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\n[L174] Observational Study\r\n[L175] In an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\n[L176] explanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\n[L177] In short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\n[L178] the study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\n[L179] treatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\n[L180] Identifying experimental \r\n[L181] versus observational \r\n[L182] studies\r\n[L183] b\r\n[L184] Cell Phone Use\r\n[L185] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L186] Example 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\n[L187] between cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body. We\u2019ve \r\n[L188] seen that Study 3 was an experiment. Studies 1 and 2 both examined the \r\n[L189] amount of cell phone use for cancer patients and for noncancer patients us\ufffeing a questionnaire.\r\n[L190] Questions to Explore\r\n[L191] a. Were Studies 1 and 2 experimental or observational studies?\r\n[L192] b. How were Studies 1 and 2 fundamentally different from Study 3 in \r\n[L193] terms of how the treatments were determined for each subject?\r\n[L194] Think It Through\r\n[L195] a. In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\n[L196] gathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\n[L197] determined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\n[L198] observed this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\n[L199] and 2 were observational studies.\r\n[L200] b. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\n[L201] the subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\n[L202] to both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\n[L203] during the second scan. The researchers imposed the treatments on \r\n[L204] the subjects. So, Study 3 was an experimental study.*\r\n[L205] Example 2 \r\n[L206] *The researchers noted that \u201cResults of this study provide evidence that acute cell phone expo\ufffesure affects brain metabolic activity. However, these results provide no information about their \r\n[L207] relevance to potential carcinogenic effects (or lack thereof) from chronic cell phone use.\u201d","[L208] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>","[L209] 182 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L210] Let\u2019s consider another study. From its description, we\u2019ll try to determine \r\n[L211] whether it is an experiment or an observational study.\r\n[L212] Insight\r\n[L213] One reason that results of different medical studies sometimes disagree is \r\n[L214] that they are not the same type of study. Experimental studies allow direct \r\n[L215] causal inference to be made, whereas observational studies do not allow \r\n[L216] causal inference.

One question asked \r\n[L228] whether the student used drugs. The study found that drug use was similar \r\n[L229] in schools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. For \r\n[L230] instance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\n[L231] twelfth graders from the two types of schools. In addition, the figure in the \r\n[L232] margin shows the conditional proportions of drug use for these students.\r\n[L233] Questions to Explore\r\n[L234] a.

The study compared the percentage of students who used drugs in \r\n[L243] schools that tested for drugs and in schools that did not test for drugs. \r\n[L244] Whether the student used drugs was the response variable. The ex\ufffeplanatory variable was whether the student\u2019s school tested for drugs. \r\n[L245] Both variables were categorical, with categories \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d \r\n[L246] For each grade, the data were summarized in a contingency table, as \r\n[L247] shown in the margin for twelfth graders.\r\n[L248] b. For each student, the study merely observed whether his or her school \r\n[L249] tested for drugs and whether he or she used drugs. So this was an ob\ufffeservational study.\r\n[L250] Insight\r\n[L251] An experiment would have assigned schools to use or not use drug testing \r\n[L252] rather than leaving the decision to the schools. For instance, the study could \r\n[L253] have randomly selected half the schools to perform drug testing and half not to \r\n[L254] perform it and then, a year later, measured the student drug use in each school.\r\n[L255] c Try Exercise 4.7","[L256] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://568e66fa8c8c602#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":70436,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L257] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 45>","[L258] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 183\r\n[L259] As we will soon discuss, an experimental study gives the researcher more control \r\n[L260] over outside influences. This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\n[L261] association.\r\n[L262] Advantage of Experiments Over \r\n[L263] Observational\u00a0Studies\r\n[L264] In an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\n[L265] Example 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\n[L266] there could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\n[L267] cancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\n[L268] who do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\n[L269] a possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\n[L270] phones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\n[L271] screens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\n[L272] eye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\n[L273] By contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\n[L274] the results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\n[L275] which subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\n[L276] groups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\n[L277] similar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\n[L278] to have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\n[L279] condition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\n[L280] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L281] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L282] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L283] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L284] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L285] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L286] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L287] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L288] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L289] differences, on the average.\r\n[L290] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L291] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L292] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L293] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L294] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L295] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L296] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L297] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L298] imply causation.\r\n[L299] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L300] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L301] with an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\n[L302] which treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\n[L303] explanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\n[L304] discovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\n[L305] conduct an experiment.\r\n[L306] 5HFDOO\r\n[L307] From Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\n[L308] a variable not observed in the study that \r\n[L309] influences the association between the \r\n[L310] response and explanatory variables due \r\n[L311] to its own association with each of those \r\n[L312] variables. b\r\n[L313] &DXWLRQ\r\n[L314] In Example 3, the problem with the \r\n[L315] conclusion they made is that schools with \r\n[L316] high rates of drug use might be more \r\n[L317] inclined to employ drug tests to address \r\n[L318] the problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\n[L319] tests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n[L320] 0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\n[L321] also conceivable that drug use rates started \r\n[L322] at 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\n[L323] the drug test program. The problem with \r\n[L324] this observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\n[L325] know which of the previous conceivable \r\n[L326] scenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\n[L327] occurred. b","[L328] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>","[L329] 184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L330] Determining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\n[L331] If experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\n[L332] bother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\n[L333] than for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\n[L334] the following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\n[L335] use a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\n[L336] body never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\n[L337] more common for those who used cell phones.\r\n[L338] There are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\n[L339] j It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\n[L340] subjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\n[L341] harmful.\r\n[L342] j It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told. How can \r\n[L343] you monitor them to ensure that they adhere to their treatment assignment \r\n[L344] over the 50-year experimental period?\r\n[L345] j Who wants to wait 50 years to get an answer?\r\n[L346] For these reasons, medical experiments are often performed over a short time \r\n[L347] period or often with exposure to treatments that would not be out of the ordinary \r\n[L348] (such as a one-time exposure to cell phone activity). To measure the effects on \r\n[L349] people of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\n[L350] uses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\n[L351] populations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\n[L352] when we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\n[L353] studies. Then we are not deliberately placing people in harm\u2019s way, but observing \r\n[L354] people who have chosen on their own to take part in the activity of interest. In \r\n[L355] today\u2019s information age, a lot of data is readily available to assist (or impede) \r\n[L356] people from making decisions about the relationship between variables. These \r\n[L357] data provide only observational comparisons. We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\n[L358] good observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\n[L359] experiment is not practical.\r\n[L360] Finally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\n[L361] questions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\n[L362] want to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\n[L363] use a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\n[L364] Using Data Already Available\r\n[L365] Of course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\n[L366] question, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\n[L367] instead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\n[L368] your personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\n[L369] phone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\n[L370] Informal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\n[L371] there is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\n[L372] disprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\n[L373] a pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\n[L374] association does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\n[L375] smoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\n[L376] is lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\n[L377] A famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n[L378] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L379] Examples of sources for available data:\r\n[L380] j General Social Survey (GSS)\r\n[L381] j http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\n[L382] j www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\n[L383] j www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\n[L384] j www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\n[L385] Kingdom)\r\n[L386] j www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)","[L387] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>","[L388] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\n[L389] research studies.

Excellent sources of available \r\n[L393] data are listed in the margin on the previous page.\r\n[L394] The Census and Other Sample Surveys\r\n[L395] The General Social Survey (GSS) is an example of a sample survey. It gathers in\ufffeformation by interviewing a sample of subjects from the U.S. adult population to \r\n[L396] provide a snapshot of that population. The study in Example 3 on student drug \r\n[L397] use in schools also used a sample survey.\r\n[L398] 2\r\n[L399] Most surveys of research about cell phones suggest that there is no convincing evidence yet of adverse \r\n[L400] radiation effects (e.g., D. R. Cox, J. Roy. Statist. Soc., Ser. A, vol. 166, pp. 241\u2013246, 2003). The primary \r\n[L401] danger appears to be people using cell phones while driving!\r\n[L402] Sample Survey\r\n[L403] A sample survey selects a sample of subjects from a population and collects data from \r\n[L404] them. In the field of statistics a survey does not just indicate an opinion poll or a question\ufffenaire; it includes any information gathered from or about the subject.\r\n[L405] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study. The subjects provide data \r\n[L406] on the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\n[L407] Most countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\n[L408] number of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\n[L409] them. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\n[L410] entire population.\r\n[L411] In Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\n[L412] of the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n[L413] 1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\n[L414] more than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\n[L415] the population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\n[L416] j The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\n[L417] census. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\n[L418] seats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\n[L419] on how their population size compares with other states.\r\n[L420] j Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\n[L421] j Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\n[L422] and local communities.\r\n[L423] Although it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\n[L424] practice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\n[L425] census bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient. \r\n[L426] Because data are needed regularly on economic variables, such as the unem\ufffeployment rate, the U.S. Bureau of the Census continually takes samples of the \r\n[L427] population rather than relying solely on the complete census. An example is the \r\n[L428] monthly Current Population Survey, which surveys about 50,000 U.S. house\ufffeholds and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the \r\n[L429] United States, including the unemployment rate. It is usually more practical, in \r\n[L430] terms of time and money, to take a sample rather than to try to measure every\ufffeone in a population.","[L431] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 45>","[L432] 186 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L433] For a sample survey to be informative, it is important for the sample to reflect \r\n[L434] the population well.

What are reasons for taking the census at all?\r\n[L607] c. The most commonly discussed characteristic learned from \r\n[L608] a census is the size of the population.

A nationwide census is conducted \r\n[L616] in the United States every 10 years.\r\n[L617] a. Give at least two reasons the United States takes a census \r\n[L618] only every 10 years.\r\n[L619] 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\r\n[L620] The sample survey is a common type of nonexperimental study. The first step of \r\n[L621] a sample survey is to define the population targeted by the study. For instance, \r\n[L622] the Gallup organization (www.gallup.com) conducts a monthly survey of about \r\n[L623] 1000 adult Americans. Gallup then reports the percentage of those sampled who \r\n[L624] respond \u201capprove\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way [the \r\n[L625] current president of the United States] is handling his job as president?\u201d If the \r\n[L626] sampling is conducted properly, this provides a good estimate of the approval \r\n[L627] rate within the entire population. The population consists of all adults living in \r\n[L628] the United States.\r\n[L629] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L630] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L631] Sampling Frame\r\n[L632] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L633] taken.\r\n[L634] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L635] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L636] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L637] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L638] of registered students.\r\n[L639] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L640] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L641] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L642] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L643] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L644] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L645] doubtful.\r\n[L646] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L647] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L648] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L649] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L650] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L651] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L652] be misleading.","[L653] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>","[L654] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L655] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L656] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L657] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L658] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L659] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L660] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L661] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L662] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L663] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L664] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L665] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L666] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L667] 5HFDOO\r\n[L668] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L669] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L670] called the sample size. b\r\n[L671] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L672] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L673] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L674] Simple random \r\n[L675] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L676] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L677] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L678] a dinner banquet and raffle. The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\n[L679] of football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\n[L680] everyone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once. (This is \r\n[L681] called sampling without replacement.) To select the two winners, the organiz\ufffeers choose a simple random sample of size n = 2 from the 60 ticket holders. \r\n[L682] Each individual at the banquet receives an entry with a number between 1 and \r\n[L683] 60. Duplicate tickets numbered 1 to 60 are placed in a container and mixed, \r\n[L684] after which the two winning entries are chosen at random. Whoever holds the \r\n[L685] tickets containing the same numbers as those drawn at random wins the foot\ufffeball tickets.\r\n[L686] Questions to Explore\r\n[L687] a. What are the possible samples?\r\n[L688] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 will be drawn?\r\n[L689] c. Professor Shaffer is in attendance at the banquet and holds entry num\ufffeber 1. What is the chance that her entry will be chosen? Mr. Chatterjee \r\n[L690] holds entry number 55. What is the chance that his entry will be chosen?\r\n[L691] Think It Through\r\n[L692] a. The entire collection of possible samples is too long to list, but we can \r\n[L693] visualize the possibilities by listing certain pairs:\r\n[L694] (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), . . . , (1,58), (1,59), (1,60)\r\n[L695] (2,3), (2,4), . . . , (2,58), (2,59), (2,60)\r\n[L696] .\r\n[L697] .\r\n[L698] .\r\n[L699] Example 4 ","[L700] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>","[L701] 190 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L702] Selecting a Simple Random Sample\r\n[L703] What\u2019s a better way to take a simple random sample than blindly drawing slips \r\n[L704] of paper out of a hat? You first number the subjects in the sampling frame. You \r\n[L705] then generate a set of those numbers randomly. Finally, you sample the subjects \r\n[L706] whose numbers were generated. One method of generating numbers randomly \r\n[L707] is to use a random number table. In practice, technology is used to generate the \r\n[L708] sample. This could be an app or a statistical program. The following example \r\n[L709] demonstrates how a random sample is generated in MINITAB (left column).\r\n[L710] Taking a Random Sample Consider taking a random sample of three students \r\n[L711] from a class in which the following students are enrolled: Aisha, Benedict, Chung, \r\n[L712] Diego, Emily, Francisco, Girish, Hank, Isabella, and Jing.\r\n[L713] It can be done in MINITAB, as shown below.\r\n[L714] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L715] The Random Numbers web app from \r\n[L716] the book\u2019s website can also be used to \r\n[L717] generate random numbers. The screenshot \r\n[L718] in the margin next to Example 5 on the next \r\n[L719] page illustrates. b\r\n[L720] (57,58), (57,59), (57,60)\r\n[L721] (58,59), (58,60)\r\n[L722] (59,60)\r\n[L723] b. The first row above contains 59 possible samples, the second row con\ufffetains 58, and so forth. There are thus 59 + 58 + c + 2 + 1, which \r\n[L724] equals 1770 possible samples. The process of randomly selecting two \r\n[L725] unique entries ensures that each possible sample of size 2 has an equal \r\n[L726] chance of occurring. Since there are 1770 possible samples, the chance \r\n[L727] of any one sample being selected is 1 out of 1770.\r\n[L728] c. Looking at the top row in part a, we see that 1 shows up in 59 of the \r\n[L729] samples (all of the samples listed in the top row). So the chance that \r\n[L730] Professor Shaffer wins season tickets is 59 out of 1770.\r\n[L731] Insight\r\n[L732] The chance of 59/1770 for Professor Shaffer is the same as that of \r\n[L733] Mr.\u00a0Chatterjee and everyone else in attendance. In practice, especially with \r\n[L734] large populations, it is difficult to mix the entrants\u2019 numbers in a container \r\n[L735] so that each sample truly has an equal chance of selection. There are better \r\n[L736] ways of selecting simple random samples, as we\u2019ll learn next.\r\n[L737] c Try Exercise 4.16","[L738] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://2a1ab342a4235ad#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60206,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L739] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 45>","[L740] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 191\r\n[L741] When we executed this command in MINITAB, the following random sample \r\n[L742] was obtained.

It \r\n[L751] is too time-consuming and expensive for auditors to review all accounts, \r\n[L752] so they typically review only some of them. So that a school district cannot \r\n[L753] anticipate which accounts will be reviewed, the auditors often take a simple \r\n[L754] random sample of the accounts.\r\n[L755] Questions to Explore\r\n[L756] a. How can the auditors use random numbers to select 10 accounts to \r\n[L757] audit in a school district that has 60 accounts?\r\n[L758] b. Why is it important for the auditors not to use personal judgment in \r\n[L759] selecting the accounts to audit?\r\n[L760] Think It Through\r\n[L761] a. The sampling frame consists of the 60 accounts. We first number the \r\n[L762] accounts 1 through 60. Alternatively, they could list the names of the \r\n[L763] accounts. The accounts MINITAB selected (see below for details of \r\n[L764] the process) were 56, 43, 35, 47, 15, 8, 31, 9, 33, and 36. We cannot \r\n[L765] verify that these numbers are randomly selected, but we know that the \r\n[L766] process used to generate them employs random selection.\r\n[L767] b. By using simple random sampling, the auditors hold the school district \r\n[L768] responsible for all accounts. If the auditors personally chose the ac\ufffecounts to audit, they might select certain accounts each year. A school \r\n[L769] district would soon learn which accounts they need to have in order \r\n[L770] and which accounts can be given less attention.\r\n[L771] Insight\r\n[L772] Likewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) randomly selects some tax re\ufffeturns for audit, so taxpayers cannot predict ahead of time whether they will \r\n[L773] be audited. For efficiency, the IRS samples a small proportion of tax returns \r\n[L774] with small amounts owed and a larger proportion of tax returns with high \r\n[L775] amounts owed. It does this because it cares about the total amount of tax \r\n[L776] revenue brought in.\r\n[L777] c Try Exercise 4.17\r\n[L778] Example 5 \r\n[L779] Methods of Collecting Data in Sample Surveys\r\n[L780] In Example 5, the subjects sampled were accounts. More commonly, they are \r\n[L781] people. For any survey, it is difficult to get a good sampling frame since a list of \r\n[L782] all adults in a population typically does not exist. So, it\u2019s necessary to pick a place \r\n[L783] where almost all people can be found\u2014a person\u2019s place of residence.\r\n[L784] Once we identify the desired sample for a survey, how do we contact the \r\n[L785] people to collect the data?

An advantage is that \r\n[L794] subjects are more likely to participate. A disadvantage is the cost. Also, some sub\ufffejects may not answer sensitive questions pertaining to opinions or lifestyle, such \r\n[L795] as alcohol and drug use, whether they have been victims of sexual abuse, or their \r\n[L796] HIV status that they might answer on a printed questionnaire.\r\n[L797] Telephone interview A telephone interview is like a personal interview but \r\n[L798] conducted over the phone. A main advantage is lower cost because no travel is \r\n[L799] involved. A disadvantage is that the interview might have to be short. Subjects \r\n[L800] generally aren\u2019t as patient on the phone and may hang up before starting or com\ufffepleting the interview.\r\n[L801] Self-administered questionnaire Subjects are requested to fill out a questionnaire \r\n[L802] mailed, e-mailed, or otherwise available online. An advantage is that it is cheaper \r\n[L803] than a personal interview. A disadvantage is that fewer people tend to participate.\r\n[L804] So which method is most used? Most major national polls that survey regularly \r\n[L805] to measure public opinion use the telephone interview. An example is the polls \r\n[L806] conducted by the Gallup organization. The General Social Survey is an exception, \r\n[L807] using personal interviews for its questionnaire, which is quite long.\r\n[L808] For telephone interviews, since the mid-1980s, many sample surveys have used \r\n[L809] random digit dialing to select households. The survey can then obtain a sample \r\n[L810] without having a sampling frame. In the United States, typically the area code \r\n[L811] and the 3-digit exchange are randomly selected from the list of all such codes and \r\n[L812] exchanges. Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\n[L813] randomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\n[L814] randomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\n[L815] likely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\n[L816] exactly one telephone?)\r\n[L817] Sources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\n[L818] A variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\n[L819] the population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\n[L820] of the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n[L821] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L822] Besides Gallup, there are other polling \r\n[L823] groups that conduct national surveys, \r\n[L824] such\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\n[L825] people-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n[L826] (www.zogby.com).

The main way \r\n[L836] this occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\n[L837] undercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\n[L838] the population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\n[L839] prison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\n[L840] consists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\n[L841] landlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\n[L842] those who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\n[L843] are in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\n[L844] sampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\n[L845] Nonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\n[L846] cannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\n[L847] subjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\n[L848] in some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\n[L849] issues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\n[L850] questions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\n[L851] suffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\n[L852] telephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\n[L853] nonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\n[L854] only about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\n[L855] contact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\n[L856] Results have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\n[L857] in her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\n[L858] feminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\n[L859] States. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\n[L860] least five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\n[L861] questionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\n[L862] large. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\n[L863] know whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\n[L864] of the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\n[L865] adult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\n[L866] of using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\n[L867] Response bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\n[L868] This is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\n[L869] way, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\n[L870] lie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\n[L871] the response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\n[L872] If you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\n[L873] questions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\n[L874] long, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\n[L875] Roper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II. In response to \r\n[L876] the question, \u201cDoes it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the \r\n[L877] Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?\u201d 22% said it was possible the \r\n[L878] Holocaust never happened. The Roper organization later admitted that the ques\ufffetion was worded in a confusing manner. When it asked, \u201cDoes it seem possible \r\n[L879] to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel \r\n[L880] certain that it happened?\u201d only 1% said it was possible it never happened.4\r\n[L881] Even the order in which questions are asked can dramatically influence re\ufffesults. One study5\r\n[L882]  asked, during the Cold War, \u201cDo you think the U.S. should let \r\n[L883] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L884] There is bias if the way in which \r\n[L885] the study was designed or the \r\n[L886] data were gathered made certain \r\n[L887] outcomes occur more or less often \r\n[L888] in the sample than they do in the \r\n[L889] population. For example, consider \r\n[L890] the population of adults in your \r\n[L891] home town. The results of an opinion \r\n[L892] survey asking about raising the sales \r\n[L893] tax to support public schools may \r\n[L894] be biased in the direction of raising \r\n[L895] taxes if you sample only educators \r\n[L896] or biased in the direction of lowering \r\n[L897] taxes if you sample only business \r\n[L898] owners.

Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L932] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L933] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L934] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L935] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L936] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L937] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L938] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L939] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L940] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L941] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L942] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L943] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L944] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L945] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L946] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L947] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L948] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L949] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L950] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L951] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L952] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L953] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L954] than the general population.\r\n[L955] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L956] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L957] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L958] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L959] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L960] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L961] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L962] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L963] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.","[L964] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>","[L965] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L966] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L967] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L968] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L969] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L970] and Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\n[L971] because they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\n[L972] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L973] planned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n[L974] 2.3 million people returned the questionnaire. The Digest predicted that \r\n[L975] Landon would win, getting 57% of the vote. Instead, Landon actually got only \r\n[L976] 36%, and Roosevelt won in a landslide.\r\n[L977] Questions to Explore\r\n[L978] a. What was the population?\r\n[L979] b. How could the Literary Digest poll make such a large error, especially \r\n[L980] with such a huge sample size? What type of bias occurred in this poll?\r\n[L981] Think It Through\r\n[L982] a. The population was all registered voters in the United States in 1936.\r\n[L983] b. This survey had two severe problems:\r\n[L984] j Sampling bias due to undercoverage of the sampling frame and a \r\n[L985] nonrandom sample: In 1936, the United States was in the Great \r\n[L986] Depression. Those who had cars and country club memberships \r\n[L987] and thus received questionnaires tended to be wealthy. The wealthy \r\n[L988] tended to be primarily Republican, the political party of Landon. \r\n[L989] Many potential voters were not on the lists used for the sampling \r\n[L990] frame. There was also no guarantee that a subject in the sampling \r\n[L991] frame was a registered voter.\r\n[L992] j Nonresponse bias: Of the 10 million people who received question\ufffenaires, 7.7 million did not respond. As might be expected, those \r\n[L993] individuals who were unhappy with the incumbent (Roosevelt) were \r\n[L994] more likely to respond.\r\n[L995] Insight\r\n[L996] For this same election, a pollster who was getting his new polling agency off the \r\n[L997] ground surveyed 50,000 people and predicted that Roosevelt would win. Who \r\n[L998] was this pollster? George Gallup. The Gallup organization is still with us today. \r\n[L999] However, the Literary Digest went out of business soon after the 1936 election.6\r\n[L1000] c Try Exercise 4.24\r\n[L1001] Example 6 \r\n[L1002] A Large Sample Size Does Not Guarantee \r\n[L1003] an\u00a0Unbiased Sample\r\n[L1004] Many people think that as long as the sample size is large, it doesn\u2019t matter how \r\n[L1005] the sample was selected. This is incorrect, as illustrated by the Literary Digest\r\n[L1006] poll. A sample size of 2.3 million did not prevent poor results. The sample was \r\n[L1007] 6\r\n[L1008] Bryson, M. C. (1976), American Statistician, vol. 30, pp. 184\u2013185.","[L1009] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 45>","[L1010] 196 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1011] not representative of the population, and the sample percentage of 57% who \r\n[L1012] said they would vote for Landon was far from the actual population percentage \r\n[L1013] of 36% who voted for him. As another example, consider trying to estimate the \r\n[L1014] average grade point average (GPA) on your campus. If you select 10 students \r\n[L1015] from the library, you can produce an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs \r\n[L1016] (assuming those students who go to the library are studying more than those who \r\n[L1017] don\u2019t). If you, instead, gather a larger sample of 30 students from the library, you \r\n[L1018] still have an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs. The larger sample size \r\n[L1019] did not fix the problem of sampling in the library. Many Internet surveys have \r\n[L1020] thousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\n[L1021] as a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller. We\u2019re almost \r\n[L1022] always better off with a simple random sample of 100 people than with a volunteer \r\n[L1023] sample of thousands of people.\r\n[L1024] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Sample Survey\r\n[L1025] j Identify the population of all the subjects of interest.\r\n[L1026] j Define a sampling frame, which attempts to list all the subjects in the population.\r\n[L1027] j Use a random sampling design, implemented using random numbers, to select n\r\n[L1028] subjects from the sampling frame.\r\n[L1029] j Be cautious about sampling bias due to nonrandom samples (such as volunteer \r\n[L1030] samples) and sample undercoverage, response bias from subjects not giving their \r\n[L1031] true response or from poorly worded questions, and nonresponse bias from refusal \r\n[L1032] of subjects to participate.\r\n[L1033] In Section 4.1 we learned that experimental studies are preferable to nonex\ufffeperimental studies but are not always possible. Some types of nonexperimental \r\n[L1034] studies have fewer potential pitfalls than others. For a sample survey with random \r\n[L1035] sampling, we can make inferences about the population of interest. By contrast, \r\n[L1036] with a study using a convenience sample, results apply only to those subjects actu\ufffeally observed. For this reason, some researchers use the term observational study\r\n[L1037] to refer only to studies that use available subjects (such as a convenience sample) \r\n[L1038] and not to sample surveys that randomly select their sample.\r\n[L1039] 4.15 Choosing officers A campus club consists of five officers: \r\n[L1040] president (P), vice president (V), secretary (S), treasurer \r\n[L1041] (T), and activity coordinator (A). The club can select two \r\n[L1042] officers to travel to New Orleans for a conference; for \r\n[L1043] fairness, they decide to make the selection at random. In \r\n[L1044] essence, they are choosing a simple random sample of size \r\n[L1045] n = 2.\r\n[L1046] a. What are the possible samples of two officers?\r\n[L1047] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 \r\n[L1048] will be drawn?\r\n[L1049] c.

Hydraulic \r\n[L1091] fracturing, or fracking, is the process of drilling through \r\n[L1092] rock and injecting a pressurized mixture of sand, water, \r\n[L1093] and chemicals that fractures the rock and releases oil and \r\n[L1094] gas. There has been much debate in the media about its \r\n[L1095] impact on the environment, on land owners, and on the \r\n[L1096] economy. The survey involved contacting a nationally \r\n[L1097] representative sample of 1960 adults in 2012. Of the 1960 \r\n[L1098] people contacted, 1061 adults responded to the survey. \r\n[L1099] The study reported that those more familiar with fracking, \r\n[L1100] women, and those holding egalitarian worldviews were \r\n[L1101] more likely to oppose fracking.\r\n[L1102] a. Describe the population of interest for this study.\r\n[L1103] b. Explain why a census is not practical for this study. \r\n[L1104] What advantages does sampling offer?\r\n[L1105] c.

First, let\u2019s recall the \r\n[L1222] definition of an experimental study from Section 4.1: We assign each subject to an \r\n[L1223] experimental condition, called a treatment. We then observe the outcome on the \r\n[L1224] response variable. The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L1225] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L1226] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L1227] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L1228] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L1229] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L1230] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1231] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L1232] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L1233] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L1234] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L1235] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L1236] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L1237] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L1238] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L1239] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L1240] would like to quit.\r\n[L1241] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L1242] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L1243] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L1244] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L1245]  You need \r\n[L1246] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L1247] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L1248] 8\r\n[L1249] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L1250] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.","[L1251] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>","[L1252] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L1253] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L1254] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L1255] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L1256] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L1257] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L1258] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L1259] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L1260] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L1261] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L1262] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L1263] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L1264] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L1265] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L1266] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L1267] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L1268] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L1269] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\n[L1270] subjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\n[L1271] antidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\n[L1272] control group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n[L1273] 33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\n[L1274] compared to the placebo group.\r\n[L1275] In some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\n[L1276] than a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\n[L1277] an antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\n[L1278] It may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\n[L1279] patch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\n[L1280] a placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\n[L1281] nicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\n[L1282] Randomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\n[L1283] subjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\n[L1284] treatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\n[L1285] the study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\n[L1286] subconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\n[L1287] group that receives the antidepressant.\r\n[L1288] It is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\n[L1289] the 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\n[L1290] control group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\n[L1291] younger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\n[L1292] making them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\n[L1293] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L1294] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L1295] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L1296] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L1297] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L1298] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L1299] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L1300] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L1301] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L1302] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L1303] one treatment.","[L1304] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>","[L1305] 200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1306] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L1307] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L1308] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L1309] An analysis9\r\n[L1310]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L1311] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L1312] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L1313] studies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L1314] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L1315] 9\r\n[L1316] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L1317] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L1318] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L1319] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L1320] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L1321] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L1322] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L1323] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L1324] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L1325] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L1326] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L1327] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L1328] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L1329] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L1330] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L1331] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L1332] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L1333] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1334] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L1335] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L1336] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L1337] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L1338] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L1339] The other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\n[L1340] study observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\n[L1341] Questions to Explore\r\n[L1342] a. Identify the response and explanatory variables, the treatments, and the \r\n[L1343] experimental units.\r\n[L1344] Example 7 ","[L1345] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 45>","[L1346] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 201\r\n[L1347] Generalizing Results to Broader Populations\r\n[L1348] We\u2019ve seen that random samples are preferable to convenience samples, yet con\ufffevenience samples are more feasible than many experiments. When an experiment \r\n[L1349] uses a convenience sample, be cautious about the extent to which results gener\ufffealize to a larger population. Look carefully at the characteristics of the sample. \r\n[L1350] Do they seem representative of the overall population? If not, the results have \r\n[L1351] dubious worth.\r\n[L1352] b. How should the researchers assign the subjects to the two treatment \r\n[L1353] groups?\r\n[L1354] c. Without knowing more about this study, what would you identify as a \r\n[L1355] potential problem with the study design?\r\n[L1356] Think It Through\r\n[L1357] a. This experiment has\r\n[L1358] Response variable: Whether the subject abstains from smoking for \r\n[L1359] one year (yes or no)\r\n[L1360] Explanatory variable: Whether the subject received bupropion (yes \r\n[L1361] or no)\r\n[L1362] Treatments: bupropion, no bupropion\r\n[L1363] Experimental units: The 429 volunteers who are the study subjects\r\n[L1364] b. The researchers should randomize to assign subjects to the two treat\ufffements. They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\n[L1365] of the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\n[L1366] to the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group). The \r\n[L1367] procedure would be as follows:\r\n[L1368] j Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\n[L1369] j Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\n[L1370] bupropion group.\r\n[L1371] j Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\n[L1372] values between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\n[L1373] will receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n[L1374]  control group.\r\n[L1375] c. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\n[L1376] whether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\n[L1377] sources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\n[L1378] abstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\n[L1379] Insight\r\n[L1380] In the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\n[L1381] year, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\n[L1382] with 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\n[L1383] were not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects. However, after \r\n[L1384] two years, the percentage of nonsmokers was similar for the two groups, 42% \r\n[L1385] versus 40%.\r\n[L1386] c Try Exercise 4.32\r\n[L1387] ,Q3UDFWLFH The Randomized \r\n[L1388] Experiment in Medicine\r\n[L1389] In medicine, the randomized \r\n[L1390] experiment (clinical trial) has become \r\n[L1391] the gold standard for evaluating new \r\n[L1392] medical treatments.

But some studies mistakenly try to generalize \r\n[L1411] to a broader population than the one from which the sample was taken. A psy\ufffechologist may conduct an experiment using a sample of students from an intro\ufffeductory psychology course. For the results to be of wider interest, however, the \r\n[L1412] psychologist might claim that the conclusions generalize to all college students, \r\n[L1413] to all young adults, or even to all adults.

For\u00a0each \r\n[L1540] study, there was a control group (the users\u2019 news feed \r\n[L1541] was not manipulated), and an experimental group (the \r\n[L1542] users\u2019 news\u00a0feed was manipulated\u2014either positively or \r\n[L1543] negatively). Two variables were measured in each study \r\n[L1544] after the manipulation by Facebook: the percentage of \r\n[L1545] all words produced by a person that was positive and \r\n[L1546] the percentage of all words produced by a person that \r\n[L1547] was negative.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\n[L1585] extended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\n[L1586] alternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\n[L1587] of observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\n[L1588] with humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\n[L1589] or more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\n[L1590] Sample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\n[L1591] Designs\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\n[L1592] Simple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\n[L1593] In practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\n[L1594] or are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\n[L1595] Sometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\n[L1596] Cluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\n[L1597] frame\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\n[L1598] information is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\n[L1599] study of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\n[L1600] students can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\n[L1601] observing each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\n[L1602] For instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\n[L1603] your city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\n[L1604] city blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\n[L1605] then select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\n[L1606] Cluster Random Sample\r\n[L1607] Divide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\n[L1608] random sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\n[L1609] cluster random sample.\r\n[L1610] For personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\n[L1611] sampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\n[L1612] many observations quickly and with little travel.\r\n[L1613] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\n[L1614] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1615] Cluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\n[L1616] j A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\n[L1617] j The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\n[L1618] The disadvantages are:\r\n[L1619] j We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\n[L1620] of precision.\r\n[L1621] j Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.","[L1622] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>","[L1623] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\n[L1624] Stratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\n[L1625] number of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement. The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L1626] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L1627] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L1628] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L1629] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L1630] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L1631] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L1632] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L1633] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L1634] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L1635] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L1636] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L1637] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\n[L1638] each subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\n[L1639] in your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\n[L1640] students who work and who don\u2019t work. However, this information may not be \r\n[L1641] available for each student.\r\n[L1642] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Stratified \r\n[L1643] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1644] Stratified random sampling has the\r\n[L1645] j Advantage that you can include in your sample enough subjects in each group \r\n[L1646] (stratum) you want to evaluate.\r\n[L1647] j Disadvantage that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into \r\n[L1648] which each subject belongs.\r\n[L1649] What\u2019s the difference between a stratified sample and a cluster sample? A \r\n[L1650] stratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L1651] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L1652] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L1653] random sample).\r\n[L1654] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L1655] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L1656] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L1657] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L1658] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L1659] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L1660] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L1661] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L1662] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L1663] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L1664] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of ","[L1665] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>","[L1666] 206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1667] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L1668] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L1669] be infeasible.\r\n[L1670] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L1671] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L1672] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L1673] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L1674] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L1675] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L1676] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L1677] sampling. Similar formulas exist for other types of random sampling, but they are \r\n[L1678] complex and beyond the scope of this text.\r\n[L1679] Table 4.1 Summary of Random Sampling Methods\r\n[L1680] Method Description Advantages\r\n[L1681] Simple random \r\n[L1682] sample\r\n[L1683] Each possible sample is equally \r\n[L1684] likely\r\n[L1685] Sample tends to be a good \r\n[L1686] reflection of the population\r\n[L1687] Cluster random \r\n[L1688] sample\r\n[L1689] Identify clusters of subjects, \r\n[L1690] take\u00a0simple random sample \r\n[L1691] of the clusters\r\n[L1692] Do not need a sampling frame \r\n[L1693] of subjects, less expensive to \r\n[L1694] implement\r\n[L1695] Stratified random \r\n[L1696] sample\r\n[L1697] Divide population into groups \r\n[L1698] (strata), take simple random \r\n[L1699]  sample from each stratum\r\n[L1700] Ensures enough subjects in each \r\n[L1701] group that you want to compare\r\n[L1702] m Figure 4.2 Ways of Randomly Sampling 40 Students.

With an observational study, it\u2019s possible that an association \r\n[L1714] is due to some lurking variable. However, observational studies do have advan\ufffetages. It\u2019s often not practical to conduct an experiment. For instance, with human \r\n[L1715] subjects it\u2019s not ethical to design an experiment to study the long-term effect of \r\n[L1716] cell phone use on getting cancer. Nevertheless, it is possible to design an observa\ufffetional study that controls for identified lurking variables.\r\n[L1717] Rather than taking a cross section of a population at some time, such as with \r\n[L1718] a sample survey, some studies are backward looking (retrospective) or forward \r\n[L1719] looking (prospective). Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\n[L1720] How can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\n[L1721] use and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\n[L1722] of subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\n[L1723] and then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups.

All patients were queried about \r\n[L1732] their smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\n[L1733] least one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\n[L1734] to look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\n[L1735] Table 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\n[L1736] were the patients with lung cancer.

The lung \r\n[L1757] cancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\n[L1758] Insight\r\n[L1759] An inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\n[L1760] This suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1761] c Try Exercise 4.46\r\n[L1762] Case-Control Study\r\n[L1763] A case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\n[L1764] a\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\n[L1765] outcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1766] This is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\n[L1767] ethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\n[L1768] smoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\n[L1769] potential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\n[L1770] variables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\n[L1771] and hospital.\r\n[L1772] In a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\n[L1773] fixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\n[L1774] For instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\n[L1775] time to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\n[L1776] the explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\n[L1777] or control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\n[L1778] subjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\n[L1779] half the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\n[L1780] had lung cancer.\r\n[L1781] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L1782] In Example 8, the response \r\n[L1783] outcome of interest was having lung \r\n[L1784] cancer. The cases had lung cancer, \r\n[L1785] the controls did not have lung \r\n[L1786] cancer, and they were compared on \r\n[L1787] the explanatory variable\u2014whether \r\n[L1788] the subject had been a smoker \r\n[L1789] (yes\u00a0or no).\r\n[L1790] Case-control \r\n[L1791] studies b Cell Phone Use\r\n[L1792] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1793] Studies 1 and 2 about cell phone use in Example 1 were both case-control \r\n[L1794] studies. In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\n[L1795] randomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\n[L1796] cases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\n[L1797] eye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\n[L1798] subjects with the cases.\r\n[L1799] Question to Explore\r\n[L1800] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L1801] such as age?\r\n[L1802] Example 9 ","[L1803] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>","[L1804] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\n[L1805] Prospective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\n[L1806] into the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\n[L1807] Think It Through\r\n[L1808] We\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\n[L1809] such as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\n[L1810] were observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\n[L1811] researchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\n[L1812] variables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\n[L1813] provides.\r\n[L1814] When researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\n[L1815] relationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\n[L1816] is not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\n[L1817] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1818] Insight\r\n[L1819] The lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\n[L1820] the two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\n[L1821] finding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\n[L1822] to be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\n[L1823] users of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\n[L1824] c Try Exercise 4.47\r\n[L1825] Prospective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\n[L1826] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1827] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\n[L1828] began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years. The purpose of \r\n[L1829] the study was to explore relationships among diet, hormonal factors, smok\ufffeing habits, and exercise habits, and the risk of coronary heart disease, pul\ufffemonary disease, and stroke. Since the initial survey in 1976, the nurses have \r\n[L1830] filled out a questionnaire every two years.\r\n[L1831] Question to Explore\r\n[L1832] What does it mean for this observational study to be called prospective?\r\n[L1833] Think It Through\r\n[L1834] The retrospective smoking study in Example 8 looked to the past to learn \r\n[L1835] whether its lung cancer subjects had been smokers. By contrast, at the start \r\n[L1836] of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\n[L1837] would eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer. The study followed \r\n[L1838] each nurse into the future to see whether she developed that outcome and \r\n[L1839] to analyze whether certain explanatory variables (such as smoking) were \r\n[L1840] associated with it.\r\n[L1841] Example 10 \r\n[L1842] 11More information on this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00005152 and at \r\n[L1843] www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs.","[L1844] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://9817beec834ef81#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":69393,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1845] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 45>","[L1846] 210 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1847] Observational Studies and Causation\r\n[L1848] Can we ever definitively establish causation with an observational study? No, we \r\n[L1849] cannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\n[L1850] was observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\n[L1851] have caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\n[L1852] smoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\n[L1853] conducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\n[L1854] time, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\n[L1855] of lung cancer has increased in women compared to men.

For example, when a \r\n[L1857] prospective study begun in 1951 with 35,000 doctors ended in 2001, researchers12\r\n[L1858] estimated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who \r\n[L1859] never quit. This study estimated that at least half the people who smoke from \r\n[L1860] youth are eventually killed by their habit.\r\n[L1861] Most important, studies carried out on different populations of people have \r\n[L1862] consistently concluded that smoking is associated with lung cancer, even after ad\ufffejusting for all potentially confounding variables that researchers have suggested. \r\n[L1863] As more studies are done that adjust for confounding variables, the chance that a \r\n[L1864] lurking variable remains that can explain the association is reduced. As a conse\ufffequence, although we cannot definitively conclude that smoking causes lung can\ufffecer, physicians will not hesitate to tell you that they believe it does. As do most \r\n[L1865] statisticians, including the four authors of this text!\r\n[L1866] Multifactor Experiments\r\n[L1867] Now let\u2019s learn about other ways of performing experiments. First, we\u2019ll learn \r\n[L1868] how a single experiment can help us analyze the effects of two explanatory vari\ufffeables at once.\r\n[L1869] Categorical explanatory variables in an experiment are often referred to as \r\n[L1870] factors. For example, consider the experiment described in Example 7 to study \r\n[L1871] whether taking an antidepressant can help a smoker stop smoking. The factor \r\n[L1872] Insight\r\n[L1873] Over the years, several analyses have been conducted using data from \r\n[L1874] the Nurses\u2019 Health Study. One finding (reported in The New York Times, \r\n[L1875] February 11, 2003) was that nurses in this study who were highly overweight \r\n[L1876] 18-year-olds were five times as likely as young women of normal weight to \r\n[L1877] need hip replacement later in life.\r\n[L1878] c Try Exercise 4.48\r\n[L1879] SUMMARY: Types of Nonexperimental Studies\r\n[L1880] j A retrospective study looks into the past.\r\n[L1881] j A prospective study identifies a group (cohort) of people and observes them in \r\n[L1882] the future. In research literature, prospective studies are often referred to as cohort \r\n[L1883] studies.\r\n[L1884] j A sample survey takes a cross section of a population at the current time. \r\n[L1885] Sample surveys are sometimes called cross-sectional studies.\r\n[L1886] 12See article by R.

The experiment could then have four treatment \r\n[L1899] groups that result from cross-classifying the two factors. See Figure 4.3. The four \r\n[L1900] treatments are bupropion alone, nicotine patch alone, bupropion and nicotine \r\n[L1901] patch, neither bupropion nor nicotine patch.\r\n[L1902] Nicotine Patch (Factor 1)\r\n[L1903] Yes\r\n[L1904] Yes\r\n[L1905] No\r\n[L1906] Treatment 1\r\n[L1907] Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1908] Bupropion\r\n[L1909] Treatment 3\r\n[L1910] Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1911] Placebo\r\n[L1912] Treatment 4\r\n[L1913]  No Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1914] Placebo\r\n[L1915] Treatment 2\r\n[L1916] No Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1917] Bupropion\r\n[L1918] Bupropion\r\n[L1919] (Factor 2)\r\n[L1920] No\r\n[L1921] m Figure 4.3 An Experiment Can Use Two (or More) Factors at Once. The treatments are \r\n[L1922] the combinations of categories of the factors, as numbered in the boxes.\r\n[L1923] Why use both factors at once in an experiment? Why not do one experiment \r\n[L1924] about bupropion and a separate experiment about the nicotine patch? The rea\ufffeson is that we can learn more from a two-factor experiment. For instance, the \r\n[L1925] combination of using both a nicotine patch and bupropion may be more effective \r\n[L1926] than using either method alone.\r\n[L1927] Multifactor \r\n[L1928] experiments b Antidepressants and/or Nicotine Patches\r\n[L1929] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1930] Example 7 analyzed a study about whether bupropion helps a smoker quit \r\n[L1931] cigarettes. Let\u2019s now also consider nicotine patches as another possible ces\ufffesation aid.\r\n[L1932] Question to Explore\r\n[L1933] How can you design a single study to investigate the effects of nicotine \r\n[L1934] patches and bupropion on whether a subject relapses into smoking?\r\n[L1935] Think It Through\r\n[L1936] You could use the two factors with four treatment groups shown in Figure\u00a04.3. \r\n[L1937] Figure 4.4 portrays the design of a randomized experiment, with placebo al\ufffeternatives to bupropion and to the nicotine patch.\r\n[L1938] The study should be double-blind. After a fixed length of time, you com\ufffepare the four treatments for the percentages who have relapsed.\r\n[L1939] Insight\r\n[L1940] In fact, a two-factor experiment has been conducted to study both these fac\ufffetors.13 The most effective treatments were bupropion alone or in combination \r\n[L1941] Example 11 \r\n[L1942] 13Jorenby, D. et al.

Medical experiments often do this to compare treat\ufffements for chronic conditions that do not have a permanent cure.\r\n[L1950] To illustrate, suppose a study plans to compare an oral drug and a placebo for \r\n[L1951] treating migraine headaches. The subjects could take one treatment the first time \r\n[L1952] they get a migraine headache and the other treatment the second time they get \r\n[L1953] a migraine headache. The response is whether the subject\u2019s pain is relieved.

Question A three-factor design \r\n[L1976] could also incorporate whether a subject receives counseling to discourage smoking. \r\n[L1977] What would such a diagram look like?\r\n[L1978] with a nicotine patch. We\u2019ll explore the results in Exercise 4.72. If we in\ufffecluded a third factor of whether the subject receives counseling, we would \r\n[L1979] have three factors with 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 treatments to compare.\r\n[L1980] c Try Exercise 4.50\r\n[L1981] 5HFDOO\r\n[L1982] This study is double-blind if both the \r\n[L1983] subjects and the evaluator(s) of the subjects \r\n[L1984] do not know whether the pill is active and \r\n[L1985] whether the patch is active. b\r\n[L1986] Subject Drug Placebo\r\n[L1987] 1 Relief No relief d first matched pair\r\n[L1988] 2 Relief Relief\r\n[L1989] 3 No relief No relief\r\n[L1990] For the entire sample, we would compare the percentage of subjects who have \r\n[L1991] pain relief with the drug to the percentage who have pain relief with the placebo. \r\n[L1992] The two observations for a particular subject are called a matched pair because \r\n[L1993] they both come from the same person.\r\n[L1994] A matched-pairs design in which subjects cross over during the experiment \r\n[L1995] from using one treatment to using another treatment is called a crossover design. \r\n[L1996] Crossover design helps remove certain sources of potential bias. Using the same \r\n[L1997] subjects for each treatment keeps potential lurking variables from affecting the ","[L1998] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 45>","[L1999] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 213\r\n[L2000] results because those variables take the same values for each treatment. For in\ufffestance, any difference observed between the drug and the placebo responses is \r\n[L2001] not because subjects taking the drug had better overall health. Another example \r\n[L2002] of a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\n[L2003] An additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types. In each field, two \r\n[L2004] plots are marked, one for each fertilizer. Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L2005] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L2006] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L2007] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L2008] applied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\n[L2009] can\u2019t use many fields.\r\n[L2010] Blocking in an Experiment\r\n[L2011] The matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements. The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\n[L2012] The crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\n[L2013] In experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\n[L2014] to as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\n[L2015] within blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\n[L2016] study, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\n[L2017] so they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\n[L2018] To reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\n[L2019] In the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\n[L2020] be randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\n[L2021] effect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\n[L2022] the second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\n[L2023] assigned to the plots in a field.\r\n[L2024] culprit. They were also pioneers in developing a sound theo\uffferetical basis for the case-control method. They followed their \r\n[L2025] initial study with other case-control studies and with a long-term \r\n[L2026] prospective study that showed that smoking was not only the \r\n[L2027] predominant risk factor for lung cancer but also correlated with \r\n[L2028] other diseases.\r\n[L2029] At first, Bradford Hill was cautious about claiming that \r\n[L2030] smoking causes lung cancer. As the evidence mounted from \r\n[L2031] various studies, he accepted the causal link as being overwhelm\ufffeingly the most likely explanation. An influential article written \r\n[L2032] by Bradford Hill in 1965 proposed criteria that should be sat\ufffeisfied before you conclude that an association reflects a causal \r\n[L2033] link. For his work, in 1961 Austin Bradford Hill was knighted by \r\n[L2034] Queen Elizabeth. Richard Doll was knighted in 1971.\r\n[L2035] In the mid-20th century, Austin Bradford Hill was Britain\u2019s \r\n[L2036] leading medical statistician. In 1946, to assess the effect of strep\ufffetomycin in treating pulmonary tuberculosis, he designed what is \r\n[L2037] now regarded as the first controlled randomized medical exper\ufffeiment. About that time, doctors noticed the alarming increase \r\n[L2038] in the number of lung cancer cases. The cause was unknown \r\n[L2039] but suspected to be atmospheric pollution, particularly coal \r\n[L2040] smoke. In 1950, Bradford Hill and medical doctor and epidemi\ufffeologist Richard Doll published results of the case-control study \r\n[L2041] (Example 8) that identified smoking as a potentially important \r\n[L2042] How did statisticians become pioneers \r\n[L2043] in examining the effects of\u00a0smoking on \r\n[L2044] lung cancer?\r\n[L2045] On the Shoulders of. . .Austin Bradford Hill (1897\u20131991) \r\n[L2046] and Richard Doll (1912\u20132005) ","[L2047] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 36 / 45>","[L2048] 214 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L2049] 4.42 Student loan debt A researcher wants to compare \r\n[L2050]  student loan debt for students who attend four-year public \r\n[L2051] universities with those who attend four-year private uni\ufffeversities.

In her seminal \r\n[L2188] study (2006), she gave students a test and then randomly \r\n[L2189] divided the students into two groups. She praised the \r\n[L2190]  effort of one group and praised the intelligence of the \r\n[L2191] other group. For their next exercise, the groups were \r\n[L2192] given a choice of a challenging task or an easy task. Of \r\n[L2193] those who were praised for their effort, 90% chose the \r\n[L2194] challenging task, whereas fewer than half of the students \r\n[L2195] who were praised for their intelligence chose the challeng\ufffeing task, fearful of losing their smart status.\r\n[L2196] a.

A statistical course of three parts of \r\n[L2203] comparable length was made available in three parallel \r\n[L2204] sections for students\u2019 enrollment. Each section used a \r\n[L2205] different method for course delivery and students were as\ufffesigned to a different section for each part of the course.

Each individual\u2019s spinal fluid was analyzed to \r\n[L2266] detect the presence of two types of proteins.

The sports website ESPN.com asked visitors \r\n[L2289] of the site which team would win the Southeast region. \r\n[L2290] CHAPTER SUMMARY \r\n[L2291] This chapter introduced methods for gathering data.\r\n[L2292] j An experiment assigns subjects to experimental conditions (such \r\n[L2293] as drug or placebo) called treatments. These are categories of \r\n[L2294] the explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\n[L2295] is then observed for each subject.\r\n[L2296] j An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\n[L2297] that observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\n[L2298] observes rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\n[L2299] Since association does not imply causation, with observational \r\n[L2300] studies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\n[L2301] influence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\n[L2302] randomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\n[L2303] to the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\n[L2304] variables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\n[L2305] causation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\n[L2306] with neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\n[L2307] treatment a subject was assigned.\r\n[L2308] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\n[L2309] a sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\n[L2310] incorporate random sampling.\r\n[L2311] j A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\n[L2312] in which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\n[L2313] being selected.\r\n[L2314] j A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\n[L2315] clusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\n[L2316] as the sample.\r\n[L2317] j A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\n[L2318] groups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\n[L2319] from each stratum.\r\n[L2320] Be cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\n[L2321] such as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\n[L2322] random sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\n[L2323] nonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\n[L2324] are biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\n[L2325] Most sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\n[L2326] with many experiments. Medical studies often use retrospective\r\n[L2327] observational studies, which look at subjects\u2019 behavior in the past.\r\n[L2328] j A case-control study is an example of a retrospective study. \r\n[L2329] Subjects who have a response outcome of interest, such as \r\n[L2330] cancer, serve as cases. Other subjects not having that outcome \r\n[L2331] serve as controls. The cases and controls are compared on an \r\n[L2332] explanatory variable, such as whether they had been smokers.\r\n[L2333] A categorical explanatory variable in an experiment is also called a \r\n[L2334] factor. Multifactor experiments have at least two explanatory vari\ufffeables. With a completely randomized design, subjects are assigned \r\n[L2335] randomly to categories of each explanatory variable. Some designs \r\n[L2336] instead use blocks\u2014sets of experimental units that are matched. \r\n[L2337] Matched-pairs designs have two observations in each block. Often \r\n[L2338] this is the same subject observed for each of two treatments, such as \r\n[L2339] in a crossover study.\r\n[L2340] Data are only as good as the method used to obtain them. \r\n[L2341] Unless we use a good study design, conclusions may be faulty.","[L2342] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 45>","[L2343] Chapter Problems 217\r\n[L2344] c.

Data also suggest \r\n[L2636] that individuals who smoke marijuana are twice as likely \r\n[L2637] to develop schizophrenia as those who do not use the drug. \r\n[L2638] Contributing to the apparent relationship, a comprehen\ufffesive review done in 2007 of the existing research reported \r\n[L2639] that individuals who merely try marijuana increase their \r\n[L2640] risk of developing schizophrenia by 40%. Meanwhile, the \r\n[L2641] percentage of the population who has tried marijuana \r\n[L2642] has increased dramatically in the United States over the \r\n[L2643] past 50 years, whereas the percentage of the population \r\n[L2644] affected by schizophrenia has remained constant at about \r\n[L2645] 1%.

Explain why a randomized \r\n[L2698] clinical trial comparing 100 people who get the vaccine \r\n[L2699] to 100 people who do not get it is unlikely to be worth \r\n[L2700] doing.

She administers a question\ufffenaire to her Anthropology 437, Comparative Human \r\n[L2723] Sexuality class. She finds no appreciable difference in \r\n[L2724] attitudes between the two majors, so she concludes \r\n[L2725] that the two student groups are about the same in their \r\n[L2726] views about premarital sex.\r\n[L2727] d.

Then, using a random num\ufffeber table, she chooses a class at random and interviews \r\n[L2739] every student in that class about the proposed test.\r\n[L2740] b. A new restaurant opened in January. In June, after \r\n[L2741] six months of operation, the owner applied for a loan \r\n[L2742] to improve the building. The loan application asked \r\n[L2743] for the annual gross income of the business. The \r\n[L2744] owner\u2019s record book contains receipts for each day \r\n[L2745] of operation since opening. She decides to calculate \r\n[L2746] the average daily receipt based on a sample of the \r\n[L2747] daily records and multiply that by the number of days \r\n[L2748] of operation in a year. She samples every Friday\u2019s \r\n[L2749] record.

An \r\n[L2859] analysis of published medical studies about heart attacks \r\n[L2860] (Crossen, 1994, p. 168) noted that in the studies having ran\ufffedomization and strong controls for bias, the new therapy \r\n[L2861] provided improved treatment 9% of the time. In studies \r\n[L2862] without randomization or other controls for bias, the new \r\n[L2863] therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time.","[L2864] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 44 / 45>","[L2865] 222 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L2866] b.

Explain why you\u2019ll \r\n[L2877] tend to get a smaller sample mean if you sample n\r\n[L2878] families than if you sample n individuals (asking them \r\n[L2879] to report their family size). (Hint: When you sample \r\n[L2880] individuals, explain why you are more likely to sample \r\n[L2881] a large family than a small family. To think of this, it \r\n[L2882] may help to consider the case n = 1 with a population \r\n[L2883] of two families, one with 10\u00a0people and one with only \r\n[L2884] 2\u00a0people.)\r\n[L2885] 4.107 Capture\u2013recapture Biologists and naturalists often \r\n[L2886] use sampling to estimate sizes of populations, such as \r\n[L2887] deer or fish, for which a census is impossible. Capture\u2013 \r\n[L2888] recapture is one method for doing this. A biologist \r\n[L2889] wants to count the deer population in a certain region. \r\n[L2890] She captures 50 deer, tags each, and then releases them. \r\n[L2891] Several weeks later, she captures 125 deer and finds \r\n[L2892] that 12 of them were tagged. Let N = population size,\r\n[L2893] M = size of first sample, n = size of second sample, \r\n[L2894] R = number tagged in second sample.

It states that \u201cresearch \r\n[L2905] for the Bar found that over 40 percent of female junior \r\n[L2906] tenants said they had encountered sexual harassment \r\n[L2907] during their time at the Bar.\u201d This was based on a study \r\n[L2908] conducted at the University of Sheffield that sent a \r\n[L2909] questionnaire to 334 junior tenants at the Bar, of whom \r\n[L2910] 159 responded. Of the 159, 67 were female. Of those \r\n[L2911] females, 3 said they had experienced sexual harassment \r\n[L2912] as a major problem, and 24 had experienced it as a slight \r\n[L2913] problem.\r\n[L2914] a. The quoted statement might be misleading because \r\n[L2915] the nonresponse was large.\r\n[L2916] b. No one was forced to respond, so everyone had a \r\n[L2917] chance to be in the sample, which implies it was a \r\n[L2918] simple random sample.\r\n[L2919] c. This was an example of a completely randomized \r\n[L2920]  experiment, with whether a female junior tenant \r\n[L2921]  experienced sexual harassment as the response \r\n[L2922] variable.\r\n[L2923] d. This was a retrospective case-control study, with those \r\n[L2924] who received sexual harassment as the cases.\r\n[L2925] 4.103 Multiple choice: Effect of response categories A study \r\n[L2926] (N. Schwarz et al., Public Opinion Quarterly, vol. 49, 1985, \r\n[L2927] p. 388) asked German adults how many hours a day they \r\n[L2928] spend watching TV on a typical day. When the possible \r\n[L2929] responses were the six categories (up to 1\r\n[L2930] 2 hour, 1\r\n[L2931] 2 to 1 hour, \r\n[L2932] 1 to 11\r\n[L2933] 2 hours, . . . , more than 21\r\n[L2934] 2 hours), 16% of respondents \r\n[L2935] said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2936] 2 hours per day. When the \r\n[L2937] six categories were (up to 21\r\n[L2938] 2 hours, 21\r\n[L2939] 2 to 3 hours, . . . , more \r\n[L2940] than 4 hours), 38% said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2941] 2 hours \r\n[L2942] per day.\r\n[L2943] a. The samples could not have been random, or this \r\n[L2944] would not have happened.\r\n[L2945] b. This shows the importance of question design, especially \r\n[L2946] when people may be uncertain what the answer to the \r\n[L2947] question really is.\r\n[L2948] c. This study was an experiment, not an observational \r\n[L2949] study.\r\n[L2950] 4.104 Systematic sampling A researcher wants to select 1% of \r\n[L2951] the 10,000 subjects from the sampling frame. She selects \r\n[L2952] subjects by picking one of the first 100 on the list at ran\ufffedom, skipping 100 names to get the next subject, skipping \r\n[L2953] another 100 names to get the next subject, and so on. \r\n[L2954] This is called a systematic random sample.\r\n[L2955] a. With simple random sampling, (i) every subject is equally \r\n[L2956] likely to be chosen, and (ii) every possible sample of size \r\n[L2957] n is equally likely. Indicate which, if any, of (i) and (ii) \r\n[L2958] are true for systematic random samples. Explain.\r\n[L2959] In First Sample?\r\n[L2960] Yes (tagged) No (not tagged) Total\r\n[L2961] In Second Yes R n\r\n[L2962] Sample? No\r\n[L2963] Total M N\r\n[L2964] a. Identify the values of M, n, and R for the biologist\u2019s \r\n[L2965] experiment.\r\n[L2966] b. One way to estimate N lets the sample proportion of \r\n[L2967] tagged deer equal the population proportion of tagged \r\n[L2968] deer. Explain why this means that\r\n[L2969] R\r\n[L2970] n = M\r\n[L2971] N\r\n[L2972] and, hence, that the estimated population size is \r\n[L2973] N = 1M * n2 >R\r\n[L2974] c. Estimate the number of deer in the deer population \r\n[L2975] using the numbers given.\r\n[L2976] d. The U.S. Bureau of the Census uses capture\u2013recapture \r\n[L2977] to make adjustments to the census by estimating the \r\n[L2978] undercount. The capture phase is the census itself \r\n[L2979] (persons are \u201ctagged\u201d by having returned their census \r\n[L2980] form and being recorded as counted), and the recap\ufffeture phase (the second sample) is the postenumerative \r\n[L2981] survey (PES) conducted after the census. Label the \r\n[L2982] table in terms of the census application.","[L2983] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 45 / 45>","[L2984] Chapter Problems 223\r\n[L2985] Student Activities\r\n[L2986] 4.108 Munchie capture\u2013recapture Your class can use the \r\n[L2987]  capture\u2013recapture method described in the previous \r\n[L2988] exercise to estimate the number of goldfish in a bag \r\n[L2989] of Cheddar Goldfish. Pour the Cheddar Goldfish into \r\n[L2990] a paper bag, which represents the pond. Sample 10 of \r\n[L2991] them. For this initial sample, use Pretzel Goldfish to \r\n[L2992] replace them, to represent the tagged fish. Then select a \r\n[L2993] second sample and derive an estimate for N, the number \r\n[L2994] of Cheddar Goldfish in the original bag. See how close \r\n[L2995] your estimate comes to the actual number of fish in the \r\n[L2996] bag. (Your teacher will count the population of Cheddar \r\n[L2997] Goldfish in the bag before beginning the sampling.) If the \r\n[L2998] estimate is not close, what could be responsible, and what \r\n[L2999] would this reflect as difficulties in a real-life application \r\n[L3000] such as sampling a wildlife population?\r\n[L3001] 4.109 Activity: Sampling the states This activity illustrates \r\n[L3002] how sampling bias can result when you use a nonrandom \r\n[L3003] sample, even if you attempt to make it representative: \r\n[L3004] You are in a geography class, discussing center and \r\n[L3005] variability for several characteristics of the states in the \r\n[L3006] contiguous United States. A particular value of center is \r\n[L3007] the mean area of the states. A map and a list of the states \r\n[L3008] with their areas (in square miles) are shown in the figure \r\n[L3009] and table that follow. Area for a state includes dry land \r\n[L3010] and permanent inland water surface.\r\n[L3011] Although we could use these data to calculate the actual \r\n[L3012] mean area, let\u2019s explore how well sampling performs \r\n[L3013] in estimating the mean area by sampling five states and \r\n[L3014] finding the sample mean.\r\n[L3015] a. The most convenient sampling design is to use our \r\n[L3016] eyes to pick five states from the map that we think \r\n[L3017] have areas representative of all the states. Do this, \r\n[L3018] picking five states that you believe have areas rep\uffferesentative of the actual mean area of the states. \r\n[L3019] Compute their sample mean area.\r\n[L3020] b. Collect the sample means for all class members. \r\n[L3021] Construct a dot plot of these means. Describe the \r\n[L3022] distribution of sample means. Note the shape, center, \r\n[L3023] and variability of the distribution.\r\n[L3024] c. Another possible sampling design is simple random \r\n[L3025] sampling. Randomly select five states (using an app \r\n[L3026] or computer program) and compute the sample \r\n[L3027] mean area.\r\n[L3028] d. Collect the sample means from part c of all class \r\n[L3029] members. Construct a dot plot of the sample means \r\n[L3030] using the same horizontal scale as in part b. Describe \r\n[L3031] this distribution of sample means. Note the shape, \r\n[L3032] center, and variability of the distribution.\r\n[L3033] e. The true mean total land area for the 48 states can \r\n[L3034] be calculated from the accompanying table by divid\ufffeing the total at the bottom of the table by 48. Which \r\n[L3035] sampling method, using your eyes or using random \r\n[L3036] selection, tended to be better at estimating the true \r\n[L3037] population mean?

you\u2019d need a nonexperimental design instead.\n\n---\n\n## 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\n\n- **Population vs sample:** we learn about a population using data from a sample. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L132-L137\ue201  \n  *Example:* Population = all voters in a country; sample = 1,000 voters polled this week.\n\n- **Response variable vs explanatory variable:** outcome of interest vs a variable that may explain it. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L137-L140\ue201  \n  *Example:* Response = whether a patient recovers; explanatory = whether they received Drug A.\n\n- **Experiment:** researchers **assign** subjects to conditions (\u201ctreatments\u201d) and then observe the response. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L142-L160\ue201  \n  *Example:* Randomly assign students to \u201cmusic while studying\u201d vs \u201csilence,\u201d then compare test scores.\n\n- **Observational study (nonexperimental):** researchers **observe** variables without imposing treatments. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L169-L176\ue201  \n  *Example:* Compare people who already choose to drink coffee daily vs those who don\u2019t, and record sleep quality.\n\n- **Association \u2260 causation; lurking variables can drive an observed association.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L293-L299\ue201  \n  *Example:* Ice-cream sales correlate with drowning incidents; temperature is a plausible lurking variable.\n\n- **Why experiments help:** random assignment aims to *balance* groups on lurking variables, reducing their impact. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L273-L287\ue201  \n  *Example:* Randomly assigning fertilizer types to plots helps ensure soil quality isn\u2019t systematically better in one group.\n\n- **Why observational studies are common anyway:** experiments can be unethical, hard to enforce, or too slow; researchers may use animals or observational comparisons instead. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L330-L359\ue201  \n  *Example:* You can\u2019t force a group to use (or never use) smartphones for 50 years to study cancer outcomes.\n\n- **Anecdotal evidence is unreliable for population claims.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L370-L377\ue201  \n  *Example:* \u201cMy uncle smoked daily and lived to 90\u201d doesn\u2019t refute smoking risks for the population.\n\n- **Sample survey vs census:** a **sample survey** collects data from a sample; a **census** attempts to measure everyone (but is hard to do perfectly). \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L402-L430\ue201  \n  *Example:* Survey 50,000 households to estimate unemployment vs trying to measure every household continuously.\n\n---\n\n## 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\n\n- **Define the population first.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L620-L628\ue201  \n  *Example:* \u201cAll first-year undergraduates at the university,\u201d not \u201cpeople walking past the library.\u201d\n\n- **Sampling frame:** the list you actually sample from (often imperfect). \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L629-L635\ue201  \n  *Example:* Using a student directory misses students who aren\u2019t listed correctly (undercoverage risk).\n\n- **Sampling design:** the method for selecting from the frame; convenience designs can be badly unrepresentative. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L639-L652\ue201  \n  *Example:* Sampling only your statistics class to represent the whole school.\n\n- **Simple random sample:** every possible sample of size *n* is equally likely. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L655-L666\ue201  \n  *Example:* Assign employee IDs 1\u20262000 and randomly pick 80 IDs.\n\n- **Sampling without replacement:** a selected unit can\u2019t be selected again (common in draws). \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L677-L685\ue201  \n  *Example:* A raffle where one ticket can win only once.\n\n- **How simple random samples are produced in practice:** number the frame, generate random numbers, take the corresponding units. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L702-L707\ue201  \n  *Example:* Number 10,000 addresses and use a random-number generator to pick 200 addresses.\n\n- **Ways to contact respondents (with tradeoffs):** personal interview, telephone interview, self-administered questionnaire. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L790-L803\ue201  \n  *Example:* Door-to-door interviews may get higher participation but cost more than an online form.\n\n- **Random digit dialing introduces randomness but is not a simple random sample (not everyone has exactly one phone).** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L808-L816\ue201  \n  *Example:* Households with multiple phone lines are more likely to be reached.\n\n- **Sampling bias (incl. undercoverage):** bias from nonrandom sampling or a frame that misses parts of the population. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L835-L844\ue201  \n  *Example:* A landline-only poll undercovers mobile-only households.\n\n- **Nonresponse bias:** people who refuse/can\u2019t be reached may differ systematically from responders. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L845-L855\ue201  \n  *Example:* A mailed survey with a 5% return rate may overrepresent people with strong opinions.\n\n- **Response bias:** inaccurate answers due to leading wording, confusion, or social desirability. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L867-L874\ue201  \n  *Example:* Asking \u201cYou support saving children\u2019s lives by donating, right?\u201d pushes respondents toward \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n- **Question wording and question order can drastically change results.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L875-L880\ue202turn10file1\ue202L881-L922\ue201  \n  *Example:* \u201cShould we ban X?\u201d vs \u201cDo groups have a right to do X?\u201d can flip support levels.\n\n- **Convenience and volunteer samples are common but risky (often biased).** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L930-L954\ue201  \n  *Example:* An online news-site poll attracts people motivated to click/respond.\n\n- **Large sample size does *not* fix a biased sampling method.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1001-L1023\ue201  \n  *Example:* Sampling 3,000 students from the library still overestimates campus GPA if library-goers differ systematically.\n\n- **Key \u201cgood survey\u201d checklist:** define population, define sampling frame, use random sampling, and watch for sampling/nonresponse/response bias. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1024-L1032\ue201  \n  *Example:* A poll report that hides how the sample was chosen should be treated cautiously.\n\n---\n\n## 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment\n\n- **Experiment recap + experimental units:** experiments assign treatments and observe responses; experimental units need not be humans. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1221-L1229\ue201  \n  *Example:* Experimental units could be computer chips tested under different voltage settings.\n\n- **Control comparison group is essential for interpretation.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1241-L1247\ue201  \n  *Example:* If everyone gets a new training program, you can\u2019t tell whether improvement is just normal learning over time.\n\n- **Placebo + placebo effect:** placebo helps make treatments appear identical; people can improve even with an inactive treatment. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1257-L1268\ue201  \n  *Example:* Participants report less pain after a sugar pill because of expectation, not pharmacology.\n\n- **Control doesn\u2019t have to be placebo:** sometimes it must be an existing standard treatment for ethical reasons. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1275-L1281\ue201  \n  *Example:* When a proven therapy exists, you might compare \u201cnew therapy vs standard therapy,\u201d not \u201cnew vs nothing.\u201d\n\n- **Randomization prevents assignment bias and helps balance groups on known + unknown lurking variables.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1282-L1294\ue201  \n  *Example:* Use a random-number generator to assign patients to Treatment A or B so the \u201chealthier-looking\u201d patients don\u2019t all end up in A.\n\n- **Trying to balance by judgment is unreliable:** too many variables matter, and you may miss important ones. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1295-L1303\ue201  \n  *Example:* You match groups by age, but forget baseline stress\u2014stress drives the outcome and unbalances groups anyway.\n\n- **Poorly controlled / nonrandomized experiments can be \u201coverly optimistic.\u201d** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1306-L1314\ue201  \n  *Example:* A \u201cnew miracle supplement\u201d looks great in uncontrolled studies but shrinks under randomized control.\n\n- **Blinding (especially double-blind) reduces differential treatment/measurement of groups.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1323-L1331\ue201  \n  *Example:* If evaluators know who got the new therapy, they may (even unintentionally) score outcomes more favorably.\n\n- **External validity warning:** convenience samples (e.g., volunteers) may not generalize to the intended population. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1347-L1351\ue201  \n  *Example:* Results from highly motivated volunteers may not apply to less motivated real-world patients.\n\n- **\u201cGood experiment\u201d summary:** control group + random assignment + blinding; replication builds confidence. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1416-L1427\ue201  \n  *Example:* If a finding repeats across multiple independent labs, confidence rises.\n\n---\n\n## 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and Nonexperimental Studies\n\n- **Big picture:** extend sampling beyond simple random samples; use observational designs when experiments aren\u2019t feasible; and run experiments with multiple explanatory variables. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1583-L1589\ue201  \n  *Example:* One study can test both a drug and counseling simultaneously.\n\n### Sample surveys: alternative random sampling designs\n\n- **Cluster random sampling:** randomly select clusters (groups) and include subjects in chosen clusters. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1596-L1609\ue201  \n  *Example:* Randomly sample 1% of city blocks, then interview every household on those blocks.\n\n- **Why use clusters (and the downside):** cheaper/no full subject list needed, but often needs larger sample sizes and can be too homogeneous if few clusters are chosen. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1613-L1621\ue201  \n  *Example:* Sampling only a few neighborhoods might miss the city\u2019s socioeconomic diversity.\n\n- **Stratified random sampling:** split into strata (subgroups) and take a simple random sample within each stratum. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1624-L1636\ue201  \n  *Example:* Sample 25 students from each year level (freshman/sophomore/junior/senior).\n\n- **Stratification limitation:** you must know each unit\u2019s stratum membership in the frame. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1637-L1641\ue201  \n  *Example:* You can\u2019t stratify by \u201chas a part-time job\u201d if the directory doesn\u2019t record that.\n\n- **Cluster vs stratified:** stratified uses *every* stratum; cluster uses only a *sample* of clusters. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1649-L1653\ue201  \n  *Example:* Stratify by school year (sample from all years) vs cluster by dorm (sample a few dorms).\n\n- **Multistage sampling is common in large surveys.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1662-L1673\ue201  \n  *Example:* Sample election districts, then sample households inside each selected district.\n\n### Observational studies: beyond cross-sectional surveys\n\n- **Retrospective vs prospective observational studies:** \u201clook back\u201d vs \u201cfollow forward.\u201d \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1717-L1719\ue201  \n  *Example:* Retrospective: ask current patients about past exposures; prospective: enroll healthy people now and track outcomes later.\n\n- **Case-control study (a major retrospective design):** compare cases (with outcome) vs controls (without) on an explanatory variable. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1762-L1765\ue201  \n  *Example:* Compare lung-cancer patients vs matched non-cancer patients on past smoking history.\n\n- **Why matching is used in case-control studies:** an attempt to achieve balance on key lurking variables without randomization. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1769-L1771\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1808-L1813\ue201  \n  *Example:* Match cases/controls on age and sex before comparing exposure rates.\n\n- **A crucial limitation:** because numbers of cases/controls are fixed by design, you generally can\u2019t infer population prevalence from the study\u2019s case fraction. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1772-L1780\ue201  \n  *Example:* A study with 500 cases and 500 controls does *not* imply \u201c50% of people have the disease.\u201d\n\n- **Observational studies and causation:** you can\u2019t prove causation definitively, but consistent evidence across populations + adjusting for confounders reduces alternative explanations. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1847-L1864\ue201  \n  *Example:* If many independent studies still show the same association after controlling for plausible confounders, a causal interpretation becomes more credible (though still not deductively proven).\n\n### Experiments: richer designs\n\n- **Factors and multifactor experiments:** a *factor* is a categorical explanatory variable; multifactor experiments test \u22652 factors together. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1866-L1893\ue201  \n  *Example:* Factor 1 = tutoring (yes/no), factor 2 = practice platform (A/B) \u2192 4 treatment combinations.\n\n- **Why do multifactor designs:** you can learn about combinations that may outperform single factors. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1923-L1926\ue201  \n  *Example:* Tutoring might help most *only* when paired with spaced-practice software.\n\n- **Matched pairs:** two observations within the same unit (the pair comes from the same subject/unit). \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1990-L1993\ue201  \n  *Example:* Each participant tries both interface designs and rates usability for each.\n\n- **Crossover design:** a matched-pairs design where subjects switch treatments over time; helps reduce impact of lurking variables because the same subjects receive each treatment. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L1994-L2002\ue201  \n  *Example:* A migraine patient uses Drug A for the first migraine and placebo for the second (order randomized).\n\n- **Blocks and randomized block design:** matched sets are blocks; randomize treatments within each block. \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L2013-L2017\ue201  \n  *Example:* In agriculture, each field is a block; fertilizer types are randomized across plots within that field.\n\n- **Randomize treatment order within blocks; beware carry-over effects.** \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue202L2018-L2022\ue201  \n  *Example:* If a learning intervention has lasting benefits, using it first can inflate scores even in the later \u201ccontrol\u201d phase unless order is randomized (or a washout period is used)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":154,"end_ix":183,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Design_of_experiments.pdf","id":"file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19","source":"my_files","text":"Quality study design and \ncollecting quality data ","extra":{"retrieval_turn":10,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":56,"cited_message_id":"45d669ac-90a4-4b76-98f1-413d107538fb","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":[3,21],"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":408,"end_ix":440,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Design_of_experiments.pdf","id":"file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19","source":"my_files","text":"Chapters 2 and 3 introduced graphical and numerical ways of describing data.

For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L5] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L6] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L7] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L8] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L9] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L10] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L11] one treatment.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L12] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L13] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L14] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L15] An analysis9\r\n[L16]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L17] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L18] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L19] studies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L20] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L21] 9\r\n[L22] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L23] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L24] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L25] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L26] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L27] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L28] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L29] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L30] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L31] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L32] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L33] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L34] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L35] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L36] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L37] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L38] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L39] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L40] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L41] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L42] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L43] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L44] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L45] The other group did not take an antidepressant.\n# \u30102\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"11:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Sometimes we can use an alternative experimental design in which each treatment \r\n[L2] is observed for each subject. Medical experiments often do this to compare treat\ufffements for chronic conditions that do not have a permanent cure.\r\n[L3] To illustrate, suppose a study plans to compare an oral drug and a placebo for \r\n[L4] treating migraine headaches. The subjects could take one treatment the first time \r\n[L5] they get a migraine headache and the other treatment the second time they get \r\n[L6] a migraine headache. The response is whether the subject\u2019s pain is relieved. The \r\n[L7] first three subjects might contribute the results that follow to the data file.\r\n[L8] Compare the four treatment percentages of people who have relapsed after fixed time.\r\n[L9] Randomly Assign to Treatment\r\n[L10] Experimental Units: n Smokers\r\n[L11] Treatment 1\r\n[L12] Bupropion/\r\n[L13] Nicotine patch\r\n[L14] (n/4 subjects)\r\n[L15] Treatment 2\r\n[L16] Bupropion/\r\n[L17] Placebo patch\r\n[L18] (n/4 subjects)\r\n[L19] Treatment 3\r\n[L20] Placebo bupropion/\r\n[L21] Nicotine patch\r\n[L22] (n/4 subjects)\r\n[L23] Treatment 4\r\n[L24] Placebo bupropion/\r\n[L25] Placebo patch\r\n[L26] (n/4 subjects)\r\n[L27] m Figure 4.4 Diagram of a Randomized Experiment with Two Factors (Whether \r\n[L28] Use Bupropion and Whether Use a Nicotine Patch). Question A three-factor design \r\n[L29] could also incorporate whether a subject receives counseling to discourage smoking. \r\n[L30] What would such a diagram look like?\r\n[L31] with a nicotine patch. We\u2019ll explore the results in Exercise 4.72. If we in\ufffecluded a third factor of whether the subject receives counseling, we would \r\n[L32] have three factors with 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 treatments to compare.\r\n[L33] c Try Exercise 4.50\r\n[L34] 5HFDOO\r\n[L35] This study is double-blind if both the \r\n[L36] subjects and the evaluator(s) of the subjects \r\n[L37] do not know whether the pill is active and \r\n[L38] whether the patch is active. b\r\n[L39] Subject Drug Placebo\r\n[L40] 1 Relief No relief d first matched pair\r\n[L41] 2 Relief Relief\r\n[L42] 3 No relief No relief\r\n[L43] For the entire sample, we would compare the percentage of subjects who have \r\n[L44] pain relief with the drug to the percentage who have pain relief with the placebo. \r\n[L45] The two observations for a particular subject are called a matched pair because \r\n[L46] they both come from the same person.\r\n[L47] A matched-pairs design in which subjects cross over during the experiment \r\n[L48] from using one treatment to using another treatment is called a crossover design. \r\n[L49] Crossover design helps remove certain sources of potential bias. Using the same \r\n[L50] subjects for each treatment keeps potential lurking variables from affecting the <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 45>Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 213\r\n[L51] results because those variables take the same values for each treatment. For in\ufffestance, any difference observed between the drug and the placebo responses is \r\n[L52] not because subjects taking the drug had better overall health. Another example \r\n[L53] of a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\n[L54] An additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types. In each field, two \r\n[L55] plots are marked, one for each fertilizer. Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L56] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L57] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L58] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L59] applied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\n[L60] can\u2019t use many fields.\r\n[L61] Blocking in an Experiment\r\n[L62] The matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements.\n# \u30103\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn11file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"11:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\n[L2] bupropion group.\r\n[L3] j Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\n[L4] values between 001 and 429.

For the results to be of wider interest, however, the \r\n[L42] psychologist might claim that the conclusions generalize to all college students, \r\n[L43] to all young adults, or even to all adults. Such generalizations may be wrong since \r\n[L44] the sample may differ from those populations in fundamental ways such as in \r\n[L45] average socioeconomic status, race, or gender, or attitudes.\r\n[L46] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Good Experiment\r\n[L47] j A good experiment has a control comparison group, randomization in assigning \r\n[L48] experimental units to treatments, and blinding.\r\n[L49] j The experimental units are the subjects\u2014the people, animals, or other objects to \r\n[L50] which the treatments are applied.\r\n[L51] j The treatments are the experimental conditions imposed on the experimental \r\n[L52] units.

The \r\n[L27] procedure would be as follows:\r\n[L28] j Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\n[L29] j Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\n[L30] bupropion group.\r\n[L31] j Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\n[L32] values between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\n[L33] will receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n[L34]  control group.\r\n[L35] c. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\n[L36] whether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\n[L37] sources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\n[L38] abstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\n[L39] Insight\r\n[L40] In the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\n[L41] year, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\n[L42] with 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\n[L43] were not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects. However, after \r\n[L44] two years, the percentage of nonsmokers was similar for the two groups, 42% \r\n[L45] versus 40%.\r\n[L46] c Try Exercise 4.32\r\n[L47] ,Q3UDFWLFH The Randomized \r\n[L48] Experiment in Medicine\r\n[L49] In medicine, the randomized \r\n[L50] experiment (clinical trial) has become \r\n[L51] the gold standard for evaluating new \r\n[L52] medical treatments.

Cell \r\n[L42] phones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\n[L43] main source of this energy. The closer \r\n[L44] the antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\n[L45] greater the exposure to radiation. \r\n[L46] With the increased use of cell phones, \r\n[L47] there has been a growing concern \r\n[L48] over the potential health risks. Several \r\n[L49] studies have explored the possibility \r\n[L50] of such risks:\r\n[L51] Study 1 A German study (Stang \r\n[L52] et\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\n[L53] with a rare form of eye cancer called \r\n[L54] uveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n[L55]  patients who did not have this eye \r\n[L56] cancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\n[L57] was measured using a questionnaire. \r\n[L58] On average, the eye cancer patients \r\n[L59] used cell phones more often.\r\n[L60] Study 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\n[L61] et al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\n[L62] with brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\n[L63] without brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\n[L64] cell phone use was measured using a \r\n[L65] questionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\n[L66] two groups was similar.\r\n[L67] Study 3 A study published in The \r\n[L68] Journal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\n[L69] that cell phone use speeds up activity \r\n[L70] in the brain. As part of a randomized \r\n[L71] crossover study, 47 participants were \r\n[L72] fitted with a cell phone device on each \r\n[L73] ear and then underwent two positron \r\n[L74] emission topography, or PET, scans \r\n[L75] to measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\n[L76] During one scan, the cell phones were \r\n[L77] both turned off. During the other \r\n[L78] scan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\n[L79] call was made to the phone on the \r\n[L80] right ear. The order of when the call \r\n[L81] was received (for the first or second \r\n[L82] scan) was randomized. Comparison \r\n[L83] of the PET scans showed a significant \r\n[L84] increase in activity in the part of the \r\n[L85] brain closest to the antenna during \r\n[L86] the transmission of the automated \r\n[L87] call.\r\n[L88] Studies 1 and 3 found potential \r\n[L89] physiological responses to cell \r\n[L90] phone use.

We\u2019ll now learn about such methods, \r\n[L111] study their pros and cons, and see both good and bad ways to use them.

How can you design the study \r\n[L116] to be efficient?\r\n[L117] 4.

In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L124] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L125] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L126] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L127] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L128] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L129] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L130] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L131] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L132] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L133] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L134] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L135] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L136] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L137] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L138] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L139] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L140] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L141] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L142] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L143] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L144] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L145] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L146] 5HFDOO\r\n[L147] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L148] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L149] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L150] we call the sample.\r\n[L151] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L152] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L153] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L154] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L155] variable. b\r\n[L156] Experimental Study\r\n[L157] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L158] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L159] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L160] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L161] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L162] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories ","[L163] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>","[L164] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L165] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\n[L166] the experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\n[L167] response variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\n[L168] it increased.\r\n[L169] An experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\n[L170] in the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\n[L171] By contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\n[L172] and the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\n[L173] them. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\n[L174] Observational Study\r\n[L175] In an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\n[L176] explanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\n[L177] In short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\n[L178] the study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\n[L179] treatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\n[L180] Identifying experimental \r\n[L181] versus observational \r\n[L182] studies\r\n[L183] b\r\n[L184] Cell Phone Use\r\n[L185] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L186] Example 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\n[L187] between cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body. We\u2019ve \r\n[L188] seen that Study 3 was an experiment. Studies 1 and 2 both examined the \r\n[L189] amount of cell phone use for cancer patients and for noncancer patients us\ufffeing a questionnaire.\r\n[L190] Questions to Explore\r\n[L191] a. Were Studies 1 and 2 experimental or observational studies?\r\n[L192] b. How were Studies 1 and 2 fundamentally different from Study 3 in \r\n[L193] terms of how the treatments were determined for each subject?\r\n[L194] Think It Through\r\n[L195] a. In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\n[L196] gathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\n[L197] determined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\n[L198] observed this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\n[L199] and 2 were observational studies.\r\n[L200] b. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\n[L201] the subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\n[L202] to both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\n[L203] during the second scan. The researchers imposed the treatments on \r\n[L204] the subjects. So, Study 3 was an experimental study.*\r\n[L205] Example 2 \r\n[L206] *The researchers noted that \u201cResults of this study provide evidence that acute cell phone expo\ufffesure affects brain metabolic activity. However, these results provide no information about their \r\n[L207] relevance to potential carcinogenic effects (or lack thereof) from chronic cell phone use.\u201d","[L208] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>","[L209] 182 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L210] Let\u2019s consider another study. From its description, we\u2019ll try to determine \r\n[L211] whether it is an experiment or an observational study.\r\n[L212] Insight\r\n[L213] One reason that results of different medical studies sometimes disagree is \r\n[L214] that they are not the same type of study. Experimental studies allow direct \r\n[L215] causal inference to be made, whereas observational studies do not allow \r\n[L216] causal inference.

For \r\n[L230] instance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\n[L231] twelfth graders from the two types of schools.

So this was an ob\ufffeservational study.\r\n[L250] Insight\r\n[L251] An experiment would have assigned schools to use or not use drug testing \r\n[L252] rather than leaving the decision to the schools. For instance, the study could \r\n[L253] have randomly selected half the schools to perform drug testing and half not to \r\n[L254] perform it and then, a year later, measured the student drug use in each school.\r\n[L255] c Try Exercise 4.7","[L256] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://568e66fa8c8c602#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":70436,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L257] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 45>","[L258] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 183\r\n[L259] As we will soon discuss, an experimental study gives the researcher more control \r\n[L260] over outside influences. This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\n[L261] association.\r\n[L262] Advantage of Experiments Over \r\n[L263] Observational\u00a0Studies\r\n[L264] In an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\n[L265] Example 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\n[L266] there could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\n[L267] cancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\n[L268] who do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\n[L269] a possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\n[L270] phones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\n[L271] screens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\n[L272] eye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\n[L273] By contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\n[L274] the results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\n[L275] which subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\n[L276] groups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\n[L277] similar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\n[L278] to have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\n[L279] condition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\n[L280] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L281] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L282] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L283] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L284] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L285] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L286] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L287] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L288] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L289] differences, on the average.\r\n[L290] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L291] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L292] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L293] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L294] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L295] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L296] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L297] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L298] imply causation.\r\n[L299] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L300] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L301] with an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\n[L302] which treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\n[L303] explanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\n[L304] discovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\n[L305] conduct an experiment.\r\n[L306] 5HFDOO\r\n[L307] From Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\n[L308] a variable not observed in the study that \r\n[L309] influences the association between the \r\n[L310] response and explanatory variables due \r\n[L311] to its own association with each of those \r\n[L312] variables. b\r\n[L313] &DXWLRQ\r\n[L314] In Example 3, the problem with the \r\n[L315] conclusion they made is that schools with \r\n[L316] high rates of drug use might be more \r\n[L317] inclined to employ drug tests to address \r\n[L318] the problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\n[L319] tests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n[L320] 0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\n[L321] also conceivable that drug use rates started \r\n[L322] at 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\n[L323] the drug test program. The problem with \r\n[L324] this observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\n[L325] know which of the previous conceivable \r\n[L326] scenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\n[L327] occurred. b","[L328] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>","[L329] 184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L330] Determining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\n[L331] If experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\n[L332] bother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\n[L333] than for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\n[L334] the following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\n[L335] use a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\n[L336] body never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\n[L337] more common for those who used cell phones.\r\n[L338] There are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\n[L339] j It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\n[L340] subjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\n[L341] harmful.\r\n[L342] j It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told. How can \r\n[L343] you monitor them to ensure that they adhere to their treatment assignment \r\n[L344] over the 50-year experimental period?\r\n[L345] j Who wants to wait 50 years to get an answer?\r\n[L346] For these reasons, medical experiments are often performed over a short time \r\n[L347] period or often with exposure to treatments that would not be out of the ordinary \r\n[L348] (such as a one-time exposure to cell phone activity). To measure the effects on \r\n[L349] people of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\n[L350] uses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\n[L351] populations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\n[L352] when we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\n[L353] studies. Then we are not deliberately placing people in harm\u2019s way, but observing \r\n[L354] people who have chosen on their own to take part in the activity of interest. In \r\n[L355] today\u2019s information age, a lot of data is readily available to assist (or impede) \r\n[L356] people from making decisions about the relationship between variables. These \r\n[L357] data provide only observational comparisons. We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\n[L358] good observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\n[L359] experiment is not practical.\r\n[L360] Finally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\n[L361] questions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\n[L362] want to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\n[L363] use a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\n[L364] Using Data Already Available\r\n[L365] Of course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\n[L366] question, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\n[L367] instead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\n[L368] your personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\n[L369] phone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\n[L370] Informal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\n[L371] there is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\n[L372] disprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\n[L373] a pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\n[L374] association does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\n[L375] smoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\n[L376] is lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\n[L377] A famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n[L378] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L379] Examples of sources for available data:\r\n[L380] j General Social Survey (GSS)\r\n[L381] j http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\n[L382] j www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\n[L383] j www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\n[L384] j www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\n[L385] Kingdom)\r\n[L386] j www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)","[L387] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>","[L388] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\n[L389] research studies.

Excellent sources of available \r\n[L393] data are listed in the margin on the previous page.\r\n[L394] The Census and Other Sample Surveys\r\n[L395] The General Social Survey (GSS) is an example of a sample survey. It gathers in\ufffeformation by interviewing a sample of subjects from the U.S. adult population to \r\n[L396] provide a snapshot of that population. The study in Example 3 on student drug \r\n[L397] use in schools also used a sample survey.\r\n[L398] 2\r\n[L399] Most surveys of research about cell phones suggest that there is no convincing evidence yet of adverse \r\n[L400] radiation effects (e.g., D. R. Cox, J. Roy. Statist. Soc., Ser. A, vol. 166, pp. 241\u2013246, 2003). The primary \r\n[L401] danger appears to be people using cell phones while driving!\r\n[L402] Sample Survey\r\n[L403] A sample survey selects a sample of subjects from a population and collects data from \r\n[L404] them. In the field of statistics a survey does not just indicate an opinion poll or a question\ufffenaire; it includes any information gathered from or about the subject.\r\n[L405] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study. The subjects provide data \r\n[L406] on the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\n[L407] Most countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\n[L408] number of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\n[L409] them. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\n[L410] entire population.\r\n[L411] In Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\n[L412] of the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n[L413] 1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\n[L414] more than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\n[L415] the population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\n[L416] j The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\n[L417] census. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\n[L418] seats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\n[L419] on how their population size compares with other states.\r\n[L420] j Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\n[L421] j Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\n[L422] and local communities.\r\n[L423] Although it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\n[L424] practice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\n[L425] census bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient. \r\n[L426] Because data are needed regularly on economic variables, such as the unem\ufffeployment rate, the U.S. Bureau of the Census continually takes samples of the \r\n[L427] population rather than relying solely on the complete census. An example is the \r\n[L428] monthly Current Population Survey, which surveys about 50,000 U.S. house\ufffeholds and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the \r\n[L429] United States, including the unemployment rate. It is usually more practical, in \r\n[L430] terms of time and money, to take a sample rather than to try to measure every\ufffeone in a population.","[L431] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 45>","[L432] 186 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L433] For a sample survey to be informative, it is important for the sample to reflect \r\n[L434] the population well.

Women in the study \r\n[L591] were offered mammography screening every two years. The \r\n[L592] goal of the study was to compare incidence-based rates of \r\n[L593] death from breast cancer across four groups:\r\n[L594] 1. Women who from 1996 through 2005 were living in \r\n[L595] countries with screening.\r\n[L596] 2. Women who from 1996 through 2005 were living in \r\n[L597] countries without screening.\r\n[L598] 3.

Give at least two reasons the United States takes a census \r\n[L618] only every 10 years.\r\n[L619] 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\r\n[L620] The sample survey is a common type of nonexperimental study. The first step of \r\n[L621] a sample survey is to define the population targeted by the study. For instance, \r\n[L622] the Gallup organization (www.gallup.com) conducts a monthly survey of about \r\n[L623] 1000 adult Americans. Gallup then reports the percentage of those sampled who \r\n[L624] respond \u201capprove\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way [the \r\n[L625] current president of the United States] is handling his job as president?\u201d If the \r\n[L626] sampling is conducted properly, this provides a good estimate of the approval \r\n[L627] rate within the entire population. The population consists of all adults living in \r\n[L628] the United States.\r\n[L629] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L630] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L631] Sampling Frame\r\n[L632] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L633] taken.\r\n[L634] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L635] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L636] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L637] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L638] of registered students.\r\n[L639] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L640] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L641] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L642] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L643] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L644] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L645] doubtful.\r\n[L646] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L647] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L648] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L649] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L650] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L651] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L652] be misleading.","[L653] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>","[L654] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L655] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L656] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L657] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L658] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L659] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L660] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L661] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L662] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L663] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L664] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L665] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L666] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L667] 5HFDOO\r\n[L668] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L669] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L670] called the sample size. b\r\n[L671] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L672] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L673] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L674] Simple random \r\n[L675] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L676] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L677] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L678] a dinner banquet and raffle. The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\n[L679] of football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\n[L680] everyone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once. (This is \r\n[L681] called sampling without replacement.) To select the two winners, the organiz\ufffeers choose a simple random sample of size n = 2 from the 60 ticket holders. \r\n[L682] Each individual at the banquet receives an entry with a number between 1 and \r\n[L683] 60. Duplicate tickets numbered 1 to 60 are placed in a container and mixed, \r\n[L684] after which the two winning entries are chosen at random. Whoever holds the \r\n[L685] tickets containing the same numbers as those drawn at random wins the foot\ufffeball tickets.\r\n[L686] Questions to Explore\r\n[L687] a. What are the possible samples?\r\n[L688] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 will be drawn?\r\n[L689] c. Professor Shaffer is in attendance at the banquet and holds entry num\ufffeber 1. What is the chance that her entry will be chosen? Mr. Chatterjee \r\n[L690] holds entry number 55. What is the chance that his entry will be chosen?\r\n[L691] Think It Through\r\n[L692] a. The entire collection of possible samples is too long to list, but we can \r\n[L693] visualize the possibilities by listing certain pairs:\r\n[L694] (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), . . . , (1,58), (1,59), (1,60)\r\n[L695] (2,3), (2,4), . . . , (2,58), (2,59), (2,60)\r\n[L696] .\r\n[L697] .\r\n[L698] .\r\n[L699] Example 4 ","[L700] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>","[L701] 190 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L702] Selecting a Simple Random Sample\r\n[L703] What\u2019s a better way to take a simple random sample than blindly drawing slips \r\n[L704] of paper out of a hat? You first number the subjects in the sampling frame. You \r\n[L705] then generate a set of those numbers randomly. Finally, you sample the subjects \r\n[L706] whose numbers were generated. One method of generating numbers randomly \r\n[L707] is to use a random number table. In practice, technology is used to generate the \r\n[L708] sample. This could be an app or a statistical program. The following example \r\n[L709] demonstrates how a random sample is generated in MINITAB (left column).\r\n[L710] Taking a Random Sample Consider taking a random sample of three students \r\n[L711] from a class in which the following students are enrolled: Aisha, Benedict, Chung, \r\n[L712] Diego, Emily, Francisco, Girish, Hank, Isabella, and Jing.\r\n[L713] It can be done in MINITAB, as shown below.\r\n[L714] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L715] The Random Numbers web app from \r\n[L716] the book\u2019s website can also be used to \r\n[L717] generate random numbers. The screenshot \r\n[L718] in the margin next to Example 5 on the next \r\n[L719] page illustrates. b\r\n[L720] (57,58), (57,59), (57,60)\r\n[L721] (58,59), (58,60)\r\n[L722] (59,60)\r\n[L723] b. The first row above contains 59 possible samples, the second row con\ufffetains 58, and so forth. There are thus 59 + 58 + c + 2 + 1, which \r\n[L724] equals 1770 possible samples. The process of randomly selecting two \r\n[L725] unique entries ensures that each possible sample of size 2 has an equal \r\n[L726] chance of occurring. Since there are 1770 possible samples, the chance \r\n[L727] of any one sample being selected is 1 out of 1770.\r\n[L728] c. Looking at the top row in part a, we see that 1 shows up in 59 of the \r\n[L729] samples (all of the samples listed in the top row). So the chance that \r\n[L730] Professor Shaffer wins season tickets is 59 out of 1770.\r\n[L731] Insight\r\n[L732] The chance of 59/1770 for Professor Shaffer is the same as that of \r\n[L733] Mr.\u00a0Chatterjee and everyone else in attendance. In practice, especially with \r\n[L734] large populations, it is difficult to mix the entrants\u2019 numbers in a container \r\n[L735] so that each sample truly has an equal chance of selection. There are better \r\n[L736] ways of selecting simple random samples, as we\u2019ll learn next.\r\n[L737] c Try Exercise 4.16","[L738] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://2a1ab342a4235ad#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60206,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L739] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 45>","[L740] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 191\r\n[L741] When we executed this command in MINITAB, the following random sample \r\n[L742] was obtained.

It \r\n[L751] is too time-consuming and expensive for auditors to review all accounts, \r\n[L752] so they typically review only some of them. So that a school district cannot \r\n[L753] anticipate which accounts will be reviewed, the auditors often take a simple \r\n[L754] random sample of the accounts.\r\n[L755] Questions to Explore\r\n[L756] a. How can the auditors use random numbers to select 10 accounts to \r\n[L757] audit in a school district that has 60 accounts?\r\n[L758] b. Why is it important for the auditors not to use personal judgment in \r\n[L759] selecting the accounts to audit?\r\n[L760] Think It Through\r\n[L761] a. The sampling frame consists of the 60 accounts. We first number the \r\n[L762] accounts 1 through 60. Alternatively, they could list the names of the \r\n[L763] accounts. The accounts MINITAB selected (see below for details of \r\n[L764] the process) were 56, 43, 35, 47, 15, 8, 31, 9, 33, and 36. We cannot \r\n[L765] verify that these numbers are randomly selected, but we know that the \r\n[L766] process used to generate them employs random selection.\r\n[L767] b. By using simple random sampling, the auditors hold the school district \r\n[L768] responsible for all accounts. If the auditors personally chose the ac\ufffecounts to audit, they might select certain accounts each year. A school \r\n[L769] district would soon learn which accounts they need to have in order \r\n[L770] and which accounts can be given less attention.\r\n[L771] Insight\r\n[L772] Likewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) randomly selects some tax re\ufffeturns for audit, so taxpayers cannot predict ahead of time whether they will \r\n[L773] be audited. For efficiency, the IRS samples a small proportion of tax returns \r\n[L774] with small amounts owed and a larger proportion of tax returns with high \r\n[L775] amounts owed. It does this because it cares about the total amount of tax \r\n[L776] revenue brought in.\r\n[L777] c Try Exercise 4.17\r\n[L778] Example 5 \r\n[L779] Methods of Collecting Data in Sample Surveys\r\n[L780] In Example 5, the subjects sampled were accounts. More commonly, they are \r\n[L781] people. For any survey, it is difficult to get a good sampling frame since a list of \r\n[L782] all adults in a population typically does not exist. So, it\u2019s necessary to pick a place \r\n[L783] where almost all people can be found\u2014a person\u2019s place of residence.\r\n[L784] Once we identify the desired sample for a survey, how do we contact the \r\n[L785] people to collect the data?

An advantage is that \r\n[L794] subjects are more likely to participate. A disadvantage is the cost. Also, some sub\ufffejects may not answer sensitive questions pertaining to opinions or lifestyle, such \r\n[L795] as alcohol and drug use, whether they have been victims of sexual abuse, or their \r\n[L796] HIV status that they might answer on a printed questionnaire.\r\n[L797] Telephone interview A telephone interview is like a personal interview but \r\n[L798] conducted over the phone. A main advantage is lower cost because no travel is \r\n[L799] involved. A disadvantage is that the interview might have to be short. Subjects \r\n[L800] generally aren\u2019t as patient on the phone and may hang up before starting or com\ufffepleting the interview.\r\n[L801] Self-administered questionnaire Subjects are requested to fill out a questionnaire \r\n[L802] mailed, e-mailed, or otherwise available online. An advantage is that it is cheaper \r\n[L803] than a personal interview. A disadvantage is that fewer people tend to participate.\r\n[L804] So which method is most used? Most major national polls that survey regularly \r\n[L805] to measure public opinion use the telephone interview. An example is the polls \r\n[L806] conducted by the Gallup organization. The General Social Survey is an exception, \r\n[L807] using personal interviews for its questionnaire, which is quite long.\r\n[L808] For telephone interviews, since the mid-1980s, many sample surveys have used \r\n[L809] random digit dialing to select households. The survey can then obtain a sample \r\n[L810] without having a sampling frame. In the United States, typically the area code \r\n[L811] and the 3-digit exchange are randomly selected from the list of all such codes and \r\n[L812] exchanges. Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\n[L813] randomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\n[L814] randomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\n[L815] likely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\n[L816] exactly one telephone?)\r\n[L817] Sources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\n[L818] A variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\n[L819] the population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\n[L820] of the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n[L821] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L822] Besides Gallup, there are other polling \r\n[L823] groups that conduct national surveys, \r\n[L824] such\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\n[L825] people-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n[L826] (www.zogby.com).

The main way \r\n[L836] this occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\n[L837] undercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\n[L838] the population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\n[L839] prison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\n[L840] consists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\n[L841] landlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\n[L842] those who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\n[L843] are in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\n[L844] sampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\n[L845] Nonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\n[L846] cannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\n[L847] subjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\n[L848] in some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\n[L849] issues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\n[L850] questions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\n[L851] suffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\n[L852] telephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\n[L853] nonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\n[L854] only about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\n[L855] contact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\n[L856] Results have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\n[L857] in her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\n[L858] feminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\n[L859] States. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\n[L860] least five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\n[L861] questionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\n[L862] large. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\n[L863] know whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\n[L864] of the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\n[L865] adult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\n[L866] of using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\n[L867] Response bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\n[L868] This is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\n[L869] way, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\n[L870] lie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\n[L871] the response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\n[L872] If you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\n[L873] questions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\n[L874] long, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\n[L875] Roper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II.

For example, consider \r\n[L890] the population of adults in your \r\n[L891] home town. The results of an opinion \r\n[L892] survey asking about raising the sales \r\n[L893] tax to support public schools may \r\n[L894] be biased in the direction of raising \r\n[L895] taxes if you sample only educators \r\n[L896] or biased in the direction of lowering \r\n[L897] taxes if you sample only business \r\n[L898] owners. Alternatively, the results \r\n[L899] could be biased toward raising taxes \r\n[L900] if a higher proportion of educators \r\n[L901] responded than business owners.\r\n[L902] ,Q3UDFWLFH Be Alert for \r\n[L903] Potential Bias\r\n[L904] With any sample survey, carefully \r\n[L905] scrutinize the results.

Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L932] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L933] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L934] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L935] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L936] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L937] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L938] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L939] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L940] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L941] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L942] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L943] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L944] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L945] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L946] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L947] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L948] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L949] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L950] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L951] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L952] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L953] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L954] than the general population.\r\n[L955] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L956] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L957] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L958] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L959] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L960] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L961] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L962] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L963] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.","[L964] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>","[L965] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L966] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L967] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L968] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L969] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L970] and Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\n[L971] because they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\n[L972] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L973] planned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n[L974] 2.3 million people returned the questionnaire. The Digest predicted that \r\n[L975] Landon would win, getting 57% of the vote. Instead, Landon actually got only \r\n[L976] 36%, and Roosevelt won in a landslide.\r\n[L977] Questions to Explore\r\n[L978] a. What was the population?\r\n[L979] b. How could the Literary Digest poll make such a large error, especially \r\n[L980] with such a huge sample size? What type of bias occurred in this poll?\r\n[L981] Think It Through\r\n[L982] a. The population was all registered voters in the United States in 1936.\r\n[L983] b. This survey had two severe problems:\r\n[L984] j Sampling bias due to undercoverage of the sampling frame and a \r\n[L985] nonrandom sample: In 1936, the United States was in the Great \r\n[L986] Depression. Those who had cars and country club memberships \r\n[L987] and thus received questionnaires tended to be wealthy. The wealthy \r\n[L988] tended to be primarily Republican, the political party of Landon. \r\n[L989] Many potential voters were not on the lists used for the sampling \r\n[L990] frame. There was also no guarantee that a subject in the sampling \r\n[L991] frame was a registered voter.\r\n[L992] j Nonresponse bias: Of the 10 million people who received question\ufffenaires, 7.7 million did not respond. As might be expected, those \r\n[L993] individuals who were unhappy with the incumbent (Roosevelt) were \r\n[L994] more likely to respond.\r\n[L995] Insight\r\n[L996] For this same election, a pollster who was getting his new polling agency off the \r\n[L997] ground surveyed 50,000 people and predicted that Roosevelt would win. Who \r\n[L998] was this pollster? George Gallup. The Gallup organization is still with us today. \r\n[L999] However, the Literary Digest went out of business soon after the 1936 election.6\r\n[L1000] c Try Exercise 4.24\r\n[L1001] Example 6 \r\n[L1002] A Large Sample Size Does Not Guarantee \r\n[L1003] an\u00a0Unbiased Sample\r\n[L1004] Many people think that as long as the sample size is large, it doesn\u2019t matter how \r\n[L1005] the sample was selected. This is incorrect, as illustrated by the Literary Digest\r\n[L1006] poll. A sample size of 2.3 million did not prevent poor results. The sample was \r\n[L1007] 6\r\n[L1008] Bryson, M. C. (1976), American Statistician, vol. 30, pp. 184\u2013185.","[L1009] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 45>","[L1010] 196 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1011] not representative of the population, and the sample percentage of 57% who \r\n[L1012] said they would vote for Landon was far from the actual population percentage \r\n[L1013] of 36% who voted for him. As another example, consider trying to estimate the \r\n[L1014] average grade point average (GPA) on your campus. If you select 10 students \r\n[L1015] from the library, you can produce an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs \r\n[L1016] (assuming those students who go to the library are studying more than those who \r\n[L1017] don\u2019t). If you, instead, gather a larger sample of 30 students from the library, you \r\n[L1018] still have an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs. The larger sample size \r\n[L1019] did not fix the problem of sampling in the library. Many Internet surveys have \r\n[L1020] thousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\n[L1021] as a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller. We\u2019re almost \r\n[L1022] always better off with a simple random sample of 100 people than with a volunteer \r\n[L1023] sample of thousands of people.\r\n[L1024] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Sample Survey\r\n[L1025] j Identify the population of all the subjects of interest.\r\n[L1026] j Define a sampling frame, which attempts to list all the subjects in the population.\r\n[L1027] j Use a random sampling design, implemented using random numbers, to select n\r\n[L1028] subjects from the sampling frame.\r\n[L1029] j Be cautious about sampling bias due to nonrandom samples (such as volunteer \r\n[L1030] samples) and sample undercoverage, response bias from subjects not giving their \r\n[L1031] true response or from poorly worded questions, and nonresponse bias from refusal \r\n[L1032] of subjects to participate.\r\n[L1033] In Section 4.1 we learned that experimental studies are preferable to nonex\ufffeperimental studies but are not always possible. Some types of nonexperimental \r\n[L1034] studies have fewer potential pitfalls than others. For a sample survey with random \r\n[L1035] sampling, we can make inferences about the population of interest. By contrast, \r\n[L1036] with a study using a convenience sample, results apply only to those subjects actu\ufffeally observed. For this reason, some researchers use the term observational study\r\n[L1037] to refer only to studies that use available subjects (such as a convenience sample) \r\n[L1038] and not to sample surveys that randomly select their sample.\r\n[L1039] 4.15 Choosing officers A campus club consists of five officers: \r\n[L1040] president (P), vice president (V), secretary (S), treasurer \r\n[L1041] (T), and activity coordinator (A). The club can select two \r\n[L1042] officers to travel to New Orleans for a conference; for \r\n[L1043] fairness, they decide to make the selection at random. In \r\n[L1044] essence, they are choosing a simple random sample of size \r\n[L1045] n = 2.\r\n[L1046] a. What are the possible samples of two officers?\r\n[L1047] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 \r\n[L1048] will be drawn?\r\n[L1049] c.

Hydraulic \r\n[L1091] fracturing, or fracking, is the process of drilling through \r\n[L1092] rock and injecting a pressurized mixture of sand, water, \r\n[L1093] and chemicals that fractures the rock and releases oil and \r\n[L1094] gas. There has been much debate in the media about its \r\n[L1095] impact on the environment, on land owners, and on the \r\n[L1096] economy. The survey involved contacting a nationally \r\n[L1097] representative sample of 1960 adults in 2012. Of the 1960 \r\n[L1098] people contacted, 1061 adults responded to the survey. \r\n[L1099] The study reported that those more familiar with fracking, \r\n[L1100] women, and those holding egalitarian worldviews were \r\n[L1101] more likely to oppose fracking.\r\n[L1102] a.

First, let\u2019s recall the \r\n[L1222] definition of an experimental study from Section 4.1: We assign each subject to an \r\n[L1223] experimental condition, called a treatment. We then observe the outcome on the \r\n[L1224] response variable. The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L1225] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L1226] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L1227] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L1228] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L1229] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L1230] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1231] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L1232] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L1233] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L1234] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L1235] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L1236] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L1237] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L1238] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L1239] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L1240] would like to quit.\r\n[L1241] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L1242] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L1243] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L1244] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L1245]  You need \r\n[L1246] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L1247] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L1248] 8\r\n[L1249] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L1250] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.","[L1251] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>","[L1252] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L1253] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L1254] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L1255] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L1256] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L1257] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L1258] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L1259] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L1260] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L1261] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L1262] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L1263] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L1264] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L1265] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L1266] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L1267] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L1268] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L1269] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\n[L1270] subjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\n[L1271] antidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\n[L1272] control group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n[L1273] 33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\n[L1274] compared to the placebo group.\r\n[L1275] In some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\n[L1276] than a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\n[L1277] an antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\n[L1278] It may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\n[L1279] patch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\n[L1280] a placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\n[L1281] nicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\n[L1282] Randomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\n[L1283] subjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\n[L1284] treatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\n[L1285] the study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\n[L1286] subconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\n[L1287] group that receives the antidepressant.\r\n[L1288] It is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\n[L1289] the 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\n[L1290] control group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\n[L1291] younger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\n[L1292] making them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\n[L1293] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L1294] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L1295] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L1296] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L1297] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L1298] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L1299] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L1300] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L1301] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L1302] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L1303] one treatment.","[L1304] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>","[L1305] 200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1306] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L1307] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L1308] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L1309] An analysis9\r\n[L1310]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L1311] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L1312] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L1313] studies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L1314] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L1315] 9\r\n[L1316] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L1317] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L1318] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L1319] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L1320] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L1321] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L1322] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L1323] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L1324] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L1325] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L1326] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L1327] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L1328] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L1329] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L1330] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L1331] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L1332] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L1333] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1334] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L1335] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L1336] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L1337] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L1338] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L1339] The other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\n[L1340] study observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\n[L1341] Questions to Explore\r\n[L1342] a. Identify the response and explanatory variables, the treatments, and the \r\n[L1343] experimental units.\r\n[L1344] Example 7 ","[L1345] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 45>","[L1346] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 201\r\n[L1347] Generalizing Results to Broader Populations\r\n[L1348] We\u2019ve seen that random samples are preferable to convenience samples, yet con\ufffevenience samples are more feasible than many experiments. When an experiment \r\n[L1349] uses a convenience sample, be cautious about the extent to which results gener\ufffealize to a larger population. Look carefully at the characteristics of the sample. \r\n[L1350] Do they seem representative of the overall population? If not, the results have \r\n[L1351] dubious worth.\r\n[L1352] b. How should the researchers assign the subjects to the two treatment \r\n[L1353] groups?\r\n[L1354] c.

This experiment has\r\n[L1358] Response variable: Whether the subject abstains from smoking for \r\n[L1359] one year (yes or no)\r\n[L1360] Explanatory variable: Whether the subject received bupropion (yes \r\n[L1361] or no)\r\n[L1362] Treatments: bupropion, no bupropion\r\n[L1363] Experimental units: The 429 volunteers who are the study subjects\r\n[L1364] b. The researchers should randomize to assign subjects to the two treat\ufffements. They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\n[L1365] of the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\n[L1366] to the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group). The \r\n[L1367] procedure would be as follows:\r\n[L1368] j Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\n[L1369] j Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\n[L1370] bupropion group.\r\n[L1371] j Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\n[L1372] values between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\n[L1373] will receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n[L1374]  control group.\r\n[L1375] c. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\n[L1376] whether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\n[L1377] sources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\n[L1378] abstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\n[L1379] Insight\r\n[L1380] In the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\n[L1381] year, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\n[L1382] with 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\n[L1383] were not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects. However, after \r\n[L1384] two years, the percentage of nonsmokers was similar for the two groups, 42% \r\n[L1385] versus 40%.\r\n[L1386] c Try Exercise 4.32\r\n[L1387] ,Q3UDFWLFH The Randomized \r\n[L1388] Experiment in Medicine\r\n[L1389] In medicine, the randomized \r\n[L1390] experiment (clinical trial) has become \r\n[L1391] the gold standard for evaluating new \r\n[L1392] medical treatments.

A psy\ufffechologist may conduct an experiment using a sample of students from an intro\ufffeductory psychology course. For the results to be of wider interest, however, the \r\n[L1412] psychologist might claim that the conclusions generalize to all college students, \r\n[L1413] to all young adults, or even to all adults.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\n[L1585] extended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\n[L1586] alternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\n[L1587] of observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\n[L1588] with humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\n[L1589] or more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\n[L1590] Sample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\n[L1591] Designs\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\n[L1592] Simple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\n[L1593] In practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\n[L1594] or are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\n[L1595] Sometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\n[L1596] Cluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\n[L1597] frame\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\n[L1598] information is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\n[L1599] study of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\n[L1600] students can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\n[L1601] observing each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\n[L1602] For instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\n[L1603] your city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\n[L1604] city blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\n[L1605] then select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\n[L1606] Cluster Random Sample\r\n[L1607] Divide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\n[L1608] random sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\n[L1609] cluster random sample.\r\n[L1610] For personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\n[L1611] sampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\n[L1612] many observations quickly and with little travel.\r\n[L1613] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\n[L1614] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1615] Cluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\n[L1616] j A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\n[L1617] j The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\n[L1618] The disadvantages are:\r\n[L1619] j We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\n[L1620] of precision.\r\n[L1621] j Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.","[L1622] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>","[L1623] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\n[L1624] Stratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\n[L1625] number of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement. The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L1626] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L1627] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L1628] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L1629] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L1630] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L1631] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L1632] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L1633] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L1634] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L1635] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L1636] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L1637] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\n[L1638] each subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\n[L1639] in your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\n[L1640] students who work and who don\u2019t work. However, this information may not be \r\n[L1641] available for each student.\r\n[L1642] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Stratified \r\n[L1643] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1644] Stratified random sampling has the\r\n[L1645] j Advantage that you can include in your sample enough subjects in each group \r\n[L1646] (stratum) you want to evaluate.\r\n[L1647] j Disadvantage that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into \r\n[L1648] which each subject belongs.\r\n[L1649] What\u2019s the difference between a stratified sample and a cluster sample? A \r\n[L1650] stratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L1651] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L1652] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L1653] random sample).\r\n[L1654] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L1655] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L1656] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L1657] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L1658] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L1659] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L1660] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L1661] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L1662] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L1663] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L1664] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of ","[L1665] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>","[L1666] 206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1667] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L1668] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L1669] be infeasible.\r\n[L1670] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L1671] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L1672] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L1673] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L1674] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L1675] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L1676] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L1677] sampling.

With an observational study, it\u2019s possible that an association \r\n[L1714] is due to some lurking variable. However, observational studies do have advan\ufffetages. It\u2019s often not practical to conduct an experiment. For instance, with human \r\n[L1715] subjects it\u2019s not ethical to design an experiment to study the long-term effect of \r\n[L1716] cell phone use on getting cancer. Nevertheless, it is possible to design an observa\ufffetional study that controls for identified lurking variables.\r\n[L1717] Rather than taking a cross section of a population at some time, such as with \r\n[L1718] a sample survey, some studies are backward looking (retrospective) or forward \r\n[L1719] looking (prospective). Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\n[L1720] How can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\n[L1721] use and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\n[L1722] of subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\n[L1723] and then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups.

All patients were queried about \r\n[L1732] their smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\n[L1733] least one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\n[L1734] to look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\n[L1735] Table 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\n[L1736] were the patients with lung cancer.

The lung \r\n[L1757] cancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\n[L1758] Insight\r\n[L1759] An inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\n[L1760] This suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1761] c Try Exercise 4.46\r\n[L1762] Case-Control Study\r\n[L1763] A case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\n[L1764] a\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\n[L1765] outcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1766] This is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\n[L1767] ethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\n[L1768] smoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\n[L1769] potential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\n[L1770] variables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\n[L1771] and hospital.\r\n[L1772] In a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\n[L1773] fixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\n[L1774] For instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\n[L1775] time to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\n[L1776] the explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\n[L1777] or control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\n[L1778] subjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\n[L1779] half the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\n[L1780] had lung cancer.\r\n[L1781] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L1782] In Example 8, the response \r\n[L1783] outcome of interest was having lung \r\n[L1784] cancer. The cases had lung cancer, \r\n[L1785] the controls did not have lung \r\n[L1786] cancer, and they were compared on \r\n[L1787] the explanatory variable\u2014whether \r\n[L1788] the subject had been a smoker \r\n[L1789] (yes\u00a0or no).\r\n[L1790] Case-control \r\n[L1791] studies b Cell Phone Use\r\n[L1792] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1793] Studies 1 and 2 about cell phone use in Example 1 were both case-control \r\n[L1794] studies. In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\n[L1795] randomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\n[L1796] cases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\n[L1797] eye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\n[L1798] subjects with the cases.\r\n[L1799] Question to Explore\r\n[L1800] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L1801] such as age?\r\n[L1802] Example 9 ","[L1803] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>","[L1804] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\n[L1805] Prospective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\n[L1806] into the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\n[L1807] Think It Through\r\n[L1808] We\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\n[L1809] such as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\n[L1810] were observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\n[L1811] researchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\n[L1812] variables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\n[L1813] provides.\r\n[L1814] When researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\n[L1815] relationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\n[L1816] is not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\n[L1817] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1818] Insight\r\n[L1819] The lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\n[L1820] the two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\n[L1821] finding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\n[L1822] to be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\n[L1823] users of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\n[L1824] c Try Exercise 4.47\r\n[L1825] Prospective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\n[L1826] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1827] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\n[L1828] began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years.

By contrast, at the start \r\n[L1836] of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\n[L1837] would eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer. The study followed \r\n[L1838] each nurse into the future to see whether she developed that outcome and \r\n[L1839] to analyze whether certain explanatory variables (such as smoking) were \r\n[L1840] associated with it.\r\n[L1841] Example 10 \r\n[L1842] 11More information on this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00005152 and at \r\n[L1843] www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs.","[L1844] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://9817beec834ef81#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":69393,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1845] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 45>","[L1846] 210 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1847] Observational Studies and Causation\r\n[L1848] Can we ever definitively establish causation with an observational study? No, we \r\n[L1849] cannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\n[L1850] was observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\n[L1851] have caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\n[L1852] smoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\n[L1853] conducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\n[L1854] time, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\n[L1855] of lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\n[L1856] retrospective and prospective, have added more evidence. For example, when a \r\n[L1857] prospective study begun in 1951 with 35,000 doctors ended in 2001, researchers12\r\n[L1858] estimated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who \r\n[L1859] never quit. This study estimated that at least half the people who smoke from \r\n[L1860] youth are eventually killed by their habit.\r\n[L1861] Most important, studies carried out on different populations of people have \r\n[L1862] consistently concluded that smoking is associated with lung cancer, even after ad\ufffejusting for all potentially confounding variables that researchers have suggested. \r\n[L1863] As more studies are done that adjust for confounding variables, the chance that a \r\n[L1864] lurking variable remains that can explain the association is reduced. As a conse\ufffequence, although we cannot definitively conclude that smoking causes lung can\ufffecer, physicians will not hesitate to tell you that they believe it does. As do most \r\n[L1865] statisticians, including the four authors of this text!\r\n[L1866] Multifactor Experiments\r\n[L1867] Now let\u2019s learn about other ways of performing experiments. First, we\u2019ll learn \r\n[L1868] how a single experiment can help us analyze the effects of two explanatory vari\ufffeables at once.\r\n[L1869] Categorical explanatory variables in an experiment are often referred to as \r\n[L1870] factors. For example, consider the experiment described in Example 7 to study \r\n[L1871] whether taking an antidepressant can help a smoker stop smoking. The factor \r\n[L1872] Insight\r\n[L1873] Over the years, several analyses have been conducted using data from \r\n[L1874] the Nurses\u2019 Health Study. One finding (reported in The New York Times, \r\n[L1875] February 11, 2003) was that nurses in this study who were highly overweight \r\n[L1876] 18-year-olds were five times as likely as young women of normal weight to \r\n[L1877] need hip replacement later in life.\r\n[L1878] c Try Exercise 4.48\r\n[L1879] SUMMARY: Types of Nonexperimental Studies\r\n[L1880] j A retrospective study looks into the past.\r\n[L1881] j A prospective study identifies a group (cohort) of people and observes them in \r\n[L1882] the future. In research literature, prospective studies are often referred to as cohort \r\n[L1883] studies.\r\n[L1884] j A sample survey takes a cross section of a population at the current time. \r\n[L1885] Sample surveys are sometimes called cross-sectional studies.\r\n[L1886] 12See article by R.

The experiment could then have four treatment \r\n[L1899] groups that result from cross-classifying the two factors. See Figure 4.3. The four \r\n[L1900] treatments are bupropion alone, nicotine patch alone, bupropion and nicotine \r\n[L1901] patch, neither bupropion nor nicotine patch.\r\n[L1902] Nicotine Patch (Factor 1)\r\n[L1903] Yes\r\n[L1904] Yes\r\n[L1905] No\r\n[L1906] Treatment 1\r\n[L1907] Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1908] Bupropion\r\n[L1909] Treatment 3\r\n[L1910] Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1911] Placebo\r\n[L1912] Treatment 4\r\n[L1913]  No Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1914] Placebo\r\n[L1915] Treatment 2\r\n[L1916] No Nicotine Patch\r\n[L1917] Bupropion\r\n[L1918] Bupropion\r\n[L1919] (Factor 2)\r\n[L1920] No\r\n[L1921] m Figure 4.3 An Experiment Can Use Two (or More) Factors at Once. The treatments are \r\n[L1922] the combinations of categories of the factors, as numbered in the boxes.\r\n[L1923] Why use both factors at once in an experiment? Why not do one experiment \r\n[L1924] about bupropion and a separate experiment about the nicotine patch? The rea\ufffeson is that we can learn more from a two-factor experiment. For instance, the \r\n[L1925] combination of using both a nicotine patch and bupropion may be more effective \r\n[L1926] than using either method alone.\r\n[L1927] Multifactor \r\n[L1928] experiments b Antidepressants and/or Nicotine Patches\r\n[L1929] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1930] Example 7 analyzed a study about whether bupropion helps a smoker quit \r\n[L1931] cigarettes. Let\u2019s now also consider nicotine patches as another possible ces\ufffesation aid.\r\n[L1932] Question to Explore\r\n[L1933] How can you design a single study to investigate the effects of nicotine \r\n[L1934] patches and bupropion on whether a subject relapses into smoking?\r\n[L1935] Think It Through\r\n[L1936] You could use the two factors with four treatment groups shown in Figure\u00a04.3. \r\n[L1937] Figure 4.4 portrays the design of a randomized experiment, with placebo al\ufffeternatives to bupropion and to the nicotine patch.\r\n[L1938] The study should be double-blind. After a fixed length of time, you com\ufffepare the four treatments for the percentages who have relapsed.\r\n[L1939] Insight\r\n[L1940] In fact, a two-factor experiment has been conducted to study both these fac\ufffetors.13 The most effective treatments were bupropion alone or in combination \r\n[L1941] Example 11 \r\n[L1942] 13Jorenby, D. et al.

Medical experiments often do this to compare treat\ufffements for chronic conditions that do not have a permanent cure.\r\n[L1950] To illustrate, suppose a study plans to compare an oral drug and a placebo for \r\n[L1951] treating migraine headaches. The subjects could take one treatment the first time \r\n[L1952] they get a migraine headache and the other treatment the second time they get \r\n[L1953] a migraine headache. The response is whether the subject\u2019s pain is relieved.

Question A three-factor design \r\n[L1976] could also incorporate whether a subject receives counseling to discourage smoking. \r\n[L1977] What would such a diagram look like?\r\n[L1978] with a nicotine patch. We\u2019ll explore the results in Exercise 4.72. If we in\ufffecluded a third factor of whether the subject receives counseling, we would \r\n[L1979] have three factors with 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 treatments to compare.\r\n[L1980] c Try Exercise 4.50\r\n[L1981] 5HFDOO\r\n[L1982] This study is double-blind if both the \r\n[L1983] subjects and the evaluator(s) of the subjects \r\n[L1984] do not know whether the pill is active and \r\n[L1985] whether the patch is active. b\r\n[L1986] Subject Drug Placebo\r\n[L1987] 1 Relief No relief d first matched pair\r\n[L1988] 2 Relief Relief\r\n[L1989] 3 No relief No relief\r\n[L1990] For the entire sample, we would compare the percentage of subjects who have \r\n[L1991] pain relief with the drug to the percentage who have pain relief with the placebo. \r\n[L1992] The two observations for a particular subject are called a matched pair because \r\n[L1993] they both come from the same person.\r\n[L1994] A matched-pairs design in which subjects cross over during the experiment \r\n[L1995] from using one treatment to using another treatment is called a crossover design. \r\n[L1996] Crossover design helps remove certain sources of potential bias. Using the same \r\n[L1997] subjects for each treatment keeps potential lurking variables from affecting the ","[L1998] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 45>","[L1999] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 213\r\n[L2000] results because those variables take the same values for each treatment. For in\ufffestance, any difference observed between the drug and the placebo responses is \r\n[L2001] not because subjects taking the drug had better overall health. Another example \r\n[L2002] of a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\n[L2003] An additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types. In each field, two \r\n[L2004] plots are marked, one for each fertilizer. Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L2005] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L2006] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L2007] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L2008] applied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\n[L2009] can\u2019t use many fields.\r\n[L2010] Blocking in an Experiment\r\n[L2011] The matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements. The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\n[L2012] The crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\n[L2013] In experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\n[L2014] to as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\n[L2015] within blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\n[L2016] study, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\n[L2017] so they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\n[L2018] To reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\n[L2019] In the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\n[L2020] be randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\n[L2021] effect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\n[L2022] the second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\n[L2023] assigned to the plots in a field.\r\n[L2024] culprit. They were also pioneers in developing a sound theo\uffferetical basis for the case-control method. They followed their \r\n[L2025] initial study with other case-control studies and with a long-term \r\n[L2026] prospective study that showed that smoking was not only the \r\n[L2027] predominant risk factor for lung cancer but also correlated with \r\n[L2028] other diseases.\r\n[L2029] At first, Bradford Hill was cautious about claiming that \r\n[L2030] smoking causes lung cancer. As the evidence mounted from \r\n[L2031] various studies, he accepted the causal link as being overwhelm\ufffeingly the most likely explanation. An influential article written \r\n[L2032] by Bradford Hill in 1965 proposed criteria that should be sat\ufffeisfied before you conclude that an association reflects a causal \r\n[L2033] link. For his work, in 1961 Austin Bradford Hill was knighted by \r\n[L2034] Queen Elizabeth. Richard Doll was knighted in 1971.\r\n[L2035] In the mid-20th century, Austin Bradford Hill was Britain\u2019s \r\n[L2036] leading medical statistician. In 1946, to assess the effect of strep\ufffetomycin in treating pulmonary tuberculosis, he designed what is \r\n[L2037] now regarded as the first controlled randomized medical exper\ufffeiment. About that time, doctors noticed the alarming increase \r\n[L2038] in the number of lung cancer cases. The cause was unknown \r\n[L2039] but suspected to be atmospheric pollution, particularly coal \r\n[L2040] smoke.

The sports website ESPN.com asked visitors \r\n[L2289] of the site which team would win the Southeast region. \r\n[L2290] CHAPTER SUMMARY \r\n[L2291] This chapter introduced methods for gathering data.\r\n[L2292] j An experiment assigns subjects to experimental conditions (such \r\n[L2293] as drug or placebo) called treatments. These are categories of \r\n[L2294] the explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\n[L2295] is then observed for each subject.\r\n[L2296] j An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\n[L2297] that observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\n[L2298] observes rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\n[L2299] Since association does not imply causation, with observational \r\n[L2300] studies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\n[L2301] influence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\n[L2302] randomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\n[L2303] to the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\n[L2304] variables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\n[L2305] causation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\n[L2306] with neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\n[L2307] treatment a subject was assigned.\r\n[L2308] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\n[L2309] a sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\n[L2310] incorporate random sampling.\r\n[L2311] j A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\n[L2312] in which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\n[L2313] being selected.\r\n[L2314] j A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\n[L2315] clusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\n[L2316] as the sample.\r\n[L2317] j A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\n[L2318] groups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\n[L2319] from each stratum.\r\n[L2320] Be cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\n[L2321] such as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\n[L2322] random sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\n[L2323] nonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\n[L2324] are biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\n[L2325] Most sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\n[L2326] with many experiments. Medical studies often use retrospective\r\n[L2327] observational studies, which look at subjects\u2019 behavior in the past.\r\n[L2328] j A case-control study is an example of a retrospective study. \r\n[L2329] Subjects who have a response outcome of interest, such as \r\n[L2330] cancer, serve as cases. Other subjects not having that outcome \r\n[L2331] serve as controls. The cases and controls are compared on an \r\n[L2332] explanatory variable, such as whether they had been smokers.\r\n[L2333] A categorical explanatory variable in an experiment is also called a \r\n[L2334] factor. Multifactor experiments have at least two explanatory vari\ufffeables. With a completely randomized design, subjects are assigned \r\n[L2335] randomly to categories of each explanatory variable. Some designs \r\n[L2336] instead use blocks\u2014sets of experimental units that are matched. \r\n[L2337] Matched-pairs designs have two observations in each block. Often \r\n[L2338] this is the same subject observed for each of two treatments, such as \r\n[L2339] in a crossover study.\r\n[L2340] Data are only as good as the method used to obtain them. \r\n[L2341] Unless we use a good study design, conclusions may be faulty.","[L2342] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 45>","[L2343] Chapter Problems 217\r\n[L2344] c.

Meanwhile, the \r\n[L2641] percentage of the population who has tried marijuana \r\n[L2642] has increased dramatically in the United States over the \r\n[L2643] past 50 years, whereas the percentage of the population \r\n[L2644] affected by schizophrenia has remained constant at about \r\n[L2645] 1%.

In fact, of the 16 babies \r\n[L2827] in the study, half were shown the videos in one order \r\n[L2828] while the other half was shown the videos in the opposite \r\n[L2829]  order. Explain how to use the Random Numbers web app \r\n[L2830] to randomly divide the 16 infants into two groups of 8.\r\n[L2831] 4.96 Distinguish helping and hindering among infants, \r\n[L2832]  continued Fourteen of the 16 infants in the Yale study \r\n[L2833] elected to play with a toy resembling the helpful figure as \r\n[L2834] opposed to one resembling the hindering figure. Is this \r\n[L2835] convincing evidence that infants tend to prefer the helpful \r\n[L2836] figure? Use the Random Numbers web app on the book\u2019s \r\n[L2837] website to investigate the approximate likelihood of the \r\n[L2838] observed results of 14 out of 16 infants choosing the help\ufffeful figure, if in fact infants are indifferent between the two \r\n[L2839] figures. To perform a simulation with this app, click on the \r\n[L2840] Coin Flips tab and set the number of flips to generate equal \r\n[L2841] to 16. Click on Simulate and determine the number of heads \r\n[L2842] in the generated sequence. This represents the number of \r\n[L2843] times the child selects the helpful toy if they choose at ran\ufffedom. Repeat this simulation for a total of 10 simulations. \r\n[L2844] Out of the 10 simulations, how often did you obtain 14 or \r\n[L2845] more heads out of 16 tosses? Are your results convincing \r\n[L2846] evidence that infants actually tend to exhibit a preference?\r\n[L2847] For Exercises 4.97\u20134.103, select the best response.\r\n[L2848] 4.97 Multiple choice: What\u2019s a simple random sample? \r\n[L2849] A\u00a0simple random sample of size n is one in which\r\n[L2850] a.

An \r\n[L2859] analysis of published medical studies about heart attacks \r\n[L2860] (Crossen, 1994, p. 168) noted that in the studies having ran\ufffedomization and strong controls for bias, the new therapy \r\n[L2861] provided improved treatment 9% of the time. In studies \r\n[L2862] without randomization or other controls for bias, the new \r\n[L2863] therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time.","[L2864] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 44 / 45>","[L2865] 222 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L2866] b.

Explain why you\u2019ll \r\n[L2877] tend to get a smaller sample mean if you sample n\r\n[L2878] families than if you sample n individuals (asking them \r\n[L2879] to report their family size). (Hint: When you sample \r\n[L2880] individuals, explain why you are more likely to sample \r\n[L2881] a large family than a small family. To think of this, it \r\n[L2882] may help to consider the case n = 1 with a population \r\n[L2883] of two families, one with 10\u00a0people and one with only \r\n[L2884] 2\u00a0people.)\r\n[L2885] 4.107 Capture\u2013recapture Biologists and naturalists often \r\n[L2886] use sampling to estimate sizes of populations, such as \r\n[L2887] deer or fish, for which a census is impossible. Capture\u2013 \r\n[L2888] recapture is one method for doing this. A biologist \r\n[L2889] wants to count the deer population in a certain region. \r\n[L2890] She captures 50 deer, tags each, and then releases them. \r\n[L2891] Several weeks later, she captures 125 deer and finds \r\n[L2892] that 12 of them were tagged. Let N = population size,\r\n[L2893] M = size of first sample, n = size of second sample, \r\n[L2894] R = number tagged in second sample.

It states that \u201cresearch \r\n[L2905] for the Bar found that over 40 percent of female junior \r\n[L2906] tenants said they had encountered sexual harassment \r\n[L2907] during their time at the Bar.\u201d This was based on a study \r\n[L2908] conducted at the University of Sheffield that sent a \r\n[L2909] questionnaire to 334 junior tenants at the Bar, of whom \r\n[L2910] 159 responded. Of the 159, 67 were female. Of those \r\n[L2911] females, 3 said they had experienced sexual harassment \r\n[L2912] as a major problem, and 24 had experienced it as a slight \r\n[L2913] problem.\r\n[L2914] a. The quoted statement might be misleading because \r\n[L2915] the nonresponse was large.\r\n[L2916] b. No one was forced to respond, so everyone had a \r\n[L2917] chance to be in the sample, which implies it was a \r\n[L2918] simple random sample.\r\n[L2919] c. This was an example of a completely randomized \r\n[L2920]  experiment, with whether a female junior tenant \r\n[L2921]  experienced sexual harassment as the response \r\n[L2922] variable.\r\n[L2923] d. This was a retrospective case-control study, with those \r\n[L2924] who received sexual harassment as the cases.\r\n[L2925] 4.103 Multiple choice: Effect of response categories A study \r\n[L2926] (N. Schwarz et al., Public Opinion Quarterly, vol. 49, 1985, \r\n[L2927] p. 388) asked German adults how many hours a day they \r\n[L2928] spend watching TV on a typical day. When the possible \r\n[L2929] responses were the six categories (up to 1\r\n[L2930] 2 hour, 1\r\n[L2931] 2 to 1 hour, \r\n[L2932] 1 to 11\r\n[L2933] 2 hours, . . . , more than 21\r\n[L2934] 2 hours), 16% of respondents \r\n[L2935] said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2936] 2 hours per day. When the \r\n[L2937] six categories were (up to 21\r\n[L2938] 2 hours, 21\r\n[L2939] 2 to 3 hours, . . . , more \r\n[L2940] than 4 hours), 38% said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2941] 2 hours \r\n[L2942] per day.\r\n[L2943] a. The samples could not have been random, or this \r\n[L2944] would not have happened.\r\n[L2945] b. This shows the importance of question design, especially \r\n[L2946] when people may be uncertain what the answer to the \r\n[L2947] question really is.\r\n[L2948] c. This study was an experiment, not an observational \r\n[L2949] study.\r\n[L2950] 4.104 Systematic sampling A researcher wants to select 1% of \r\n[L2951] the 10,000 subjects from the sampling frame. She selects \r\n[L2952] subjects by picking one of the first 100 on the list at ran\ufffedom, skipping 100 names to get the next subject, skipping \r\n[L2953] another 100 names to get the next subject, and so on. \r\n[L2954] This is called a systematic random sample.\r\n[L2955] a. With simple random sampling, (i) every subject is equally \r\n[L2956] likely to be chosen, and (ii) every possible sample of size \r\n[L2957] n is equally likely. Indicate which, if any, of (i) and (ii) \r\n[L2958] are true for systematic random samples. Explain.\r\n[L2959] In First Sample?\r\n[L2960] Yes (tagged) No (not tagged) Total\r\n[L2961] In Second Yes R n\r\n[L2962] Sample? No\r\n[L2963] Total M N\r\n[L2964] a. Identify the values of M, n, and R for the biologist\u2019s \r\n[L2965] experiment.\r\n[L2966] b. One way to estimate N lets the sample proportion of \r\n[L2967] tagged deer equal the population proportion of tagged \r\n[L2968] deer. Explain why this means that\r\n[L2969] R\r\n[L2970] n = M\r\n[L2971] N\r\n[L2972] and, hence, that the estimated population size is \r\n[L2973] N = 1M * n2 >R\r\n[L2974] c.

The U.S. Bureau of the Census uses capture\u2013recapture \r\n[L2977] to make adjustments to the census by estimating the \r\n[L2978] undercount. The capture phase is the census itself \r\n[L2979] (persons are \u201ctagged\u201d by having returned their census \r\n[L2980] form and being recorded as counted), and the recap\ufffeture phase (the second sample) is the postenumerative \r\n[L2981] survey (PES) conducted after the census.

Pour the Cheddar Goldfish into \r\n[L2990] a paper bag, which represents the pond. Sample 10 of \r\n[L2991] them. For this initial sample, use Pretzel Goldfish to \r\n[L2992] replace them, to represent the tagged fish. Then select a \r\n[L2993] second sample and derive an estimate for N, the number \r\n[L2994] of Cheddar Goldfish in the original bag. See how close \r\n[L2995] your estimate comes to the actual number of fish in the \r\n[L2996] bag. (Your teacher will count the population of Cheddar \r\n[L2997] Goldfish in the bag before beginning the sampling.)

A particular value of center is \r\n[L3007] the mean area of the states. A map and a list of the states \r\n[L3008] with their areas (in square miles) are shown in the figure \r\n[L3009] and table that follow. Area for a state includes dry land \r\n[L3010] and permanent inland water surface.\r\n[L3011] Although we could use these data to calculate the actual \r\n[L3012] mean area, let\u2019s explore how well sampling performs \r\n[L3013] in estimating the mean area by sampling five states and \r\n[L3014] finding the sample mean.\r\n[L3015] a. The most convenient sampling design is to use our \r\n[L3016] eyes to pick five states from the map that we think \r\n[L3017] have areas representative of all the states. Do this, \r\n[L3018] picking five states that you believe have areas rep\uffferesentative of the actual mean area of the states. \r\n[L3019] Compute their sample mean area.\r\n[L3020] b.

Note the shape, center, \r\n[L3023] and variability of the distribution.\r\n[L3024] c. Another possible sampling design is simple random \r\n[L3025] sampling.

Cell \r\n[L42] phones emit electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, and a cell phone\u2019s antenna is the \r\n[L43] main source of this energy. The closer \r\n[L44] the antenna is to the user\u2019s head, the \r\n[L45] greater the exposure to radiation. \r\n[L46] With the increased use of cell phones, \r\n[L47] there has been a growing concern \r\n[L48] over the potential health risks. Several \r\n[L49] studies have explored the possibility \r\n[L50] of such risks:\r\n[L51] Study 1 A German study (Stang \r\n[L52] et\u00a0 al., 2001) compared 118 patients \r\n[L53] with a rare form of eye cancer called \r\n[L54] uveal melanoma to 475 healthy \r\n[L55]  patients who did not have this eye \r\n[L56] cancer. The patients\u2019 cell phone use \r\n[L57] was measured using a questionnaire. \r\n[L58] On average, the eye cancer patients \r\n[L59] used cell phones more often.\r\n[L60] Study 2 A British study (Hepworth \r\n[L61] et al., 2006) compared 966 patients \r\n[L62] with brain cancer to 1716 patients \r\n[L63] without brain cancer. The patients\u2019 \r\n[L64] cell phone use was measured using a \r\n[L65] questionnaire. Cell phone use for the \r\n[L66] two groups was similar.\r\n[L67] Study 3 A study published in The \r\n[L68] Journal of the American Medical\u00a0Asso\ufffeciation (Volkow et. al., 2011) indicates \r\n[L69] that cell phone use speeds up activity \r\n[L70] in the brain. As part of a randomized \r\n[L71] crossover study, 47 participants were \r\n[L72] fitted with a cell phone device on each \r\n[L73] ear and then underwent two positron \r\n[L74] emission topography, or PET, scans \r\n[L75] to measure brain glucose metabolism. \r\n[L76] During one scan, the cell phones were \r\n[L77] both turned off. During the other \r\n[L78] scan, an automated 50-minute muted \r\n[L79] call was made to the phone on the \r\n[L80] right ear. The order of when the call \r\n[L81] was received (for the first or second \r\n[L82] scan) was randomized. Comparison \r\n[L83] of the PET scans showed a significant \r\n[L84] increase in activity in the part of the \r\n[L85] brain closest to the antenna during \r\n[L86] the transmission of the automated \r\n[L87] call.\r\n[L88] Studies 1 and 3 found potential \r\n[L89] physiological responses to cell \r\n[L90] phone use.

We\u2019ll now learn about such methods, \r\n[L111] study their pros and cons, and see both good and bad ways to use them.

In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L124] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L125] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L126] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L127] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L128] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L129] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L130] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L131] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L132] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L133] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L134] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L135] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L136] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L137] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L138] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L139] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L140] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L141] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L142] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L143] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L144] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L145] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L146] 5HFDOO\r\n[L147] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L148] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L149] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L150] we call the sample.\r\n[L151] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L152] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L153] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L154] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L155] variable. b\r\n[L156] Experimental Study\r\n[L157] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L158] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L159] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L160] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L161] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L162] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories ","[L163] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>","[L164] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L165] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on. The purpose of \r\n[L166] the experiment was to examine the association between this variable and the \r\n[L167] response variable\u2014the amount of brain activity changes\u2014to determine whether \r\n[L168] it increased.\r\n[L169] An experiment assigns each subject to a treatment (or to both treatments as \r\n[L170] in the cross-over design employed in Study 3) and then observes the response. \r\n[L171] By contrast, many studies merely observe the values on the response variable \r\n[L172] and the explanatory variable for the sampled subjects without doing anything to \r\n[L173] them. Such studies are called observational studies. They are nonexperimental.\r\n[L174] Observational Study\r\n[L175] In an observational study, the researcher observes values of the response variable and \r\n[L176] explanatory variables for the sampled subjects, without anything being done to the sub\ufffejects (such as imposing a treatment).\r\n[L177] In short, an observational study merely observes rather than experiments with \r\n[L178] the study subjects. An experimental study assigns each subject to one or more \r\n[L179] treatments and then observes the outcome on the response variable.\r\n[L180] Identifying experimental \r\n[L181] versus observational \r\n[L182] studies\r\n[L183] b\r\n[L184] Cell Phone Use\r\n[L185] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L186] Example 1 described three studies about whether relationships might exist \r\n[L187] between cell phone use and physiological activity in the human body. We\u2019ve \r\n[L188] seen that Study 3 was an experiment.

How were Studies 1 and 2 fundamentally different from Study 3 in \r\n[L193] terms of how the treatments were determined for each subject?\r\n[L194] Think It Through\r\n[L195] a. In Studies 1 and 2, information on the amount of cell phone use was \r\n[L196] gathered by giving a questionnaire to the sampled subjects. The sub\ufffejects (people) decided how much they would use a cell phone and thus \r\n[L197] determined their amount of radiation exposure. The studies merely \r\n[L198] observed this exposure. No experiment was performed. So, Studies 1 \r\n[L199] and 2 were observational studies.\r\n[L200] b. In Study 3, each subject was given both treatments (the \u201coff\u201d condi\ufffetion and the \u201con\u201d condition). The researchers did not merely observe \r\n[L201] the subjects for the amount of brain activity but exposed the subjects \r\n[L202] to both treatments and determined which treatment each would re\ufffeceive first: Some received the call during the first PET scan and some \r\n[L203] during the second scan. The researchers imposed the treatments on \r\n[L204] the subjects. So, Study 3 was an experimental study.*\r\n[L205] Example 2 \r\n[L206] *The researchers noted that \u201cResults of this study provide evidence that acute cell phone expo\ufffesure affects brain metabolic activity.

For \r\n[L230] instance, the table in the margin shows the frequency of drug use for sampled \r\n[L231] twelfth graders from the two types of schools. In addition, the figure in the \r\n[L232] margin shows the conditional proportions of drug use for these students.\r\n[L233] Questions to Explore\r\n[L234] a.

So this was an ob\ufffeservational study.\r\n[L250] Insight\r\n[L251] An experiment would have assigned schools to use or not use drug testing \r\n[L252] rather than leaving the decision to the schools. For instance, the study could \r\n[L253] have randomly selected half the schools to perform drug testing and half not to \r\n[L254] perform it and then, a year later, measured the student drug use in each school.\r\n[L255] c Try Exercise 4.7","[L256] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://568e66fa8c8c602#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":70436,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L257] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 45>","[L258] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 183\r\n[L259] As we will soon discuss, an experimental study gives the researcher more control \r\n[L260] over outside influences. This control can allow more accuracy in studying the \r\n[L261] association.\r\n[L262] Advantage of Experiments Over \r\n[L263] Observational\u00a0Studies\r\n[L264] In an observational study, lurking variables can affect the results. Study 1 in \r\n[L265] Example 1 found an association between cell phone use and eye cancer. However, \r\n[L266] there could be lifestyle, genetic, or health differences between the subjects with eye \r\n[L267] cancer and those without it, and between those who use cell phones a lot and those \r\n[L268] who do not. A lurking variable could affect the observed association. For example, \r\n[L269] a possible lifestyle lurking variable is computer use. Perhaps those who use cell \r\n[L270] phones often also use computers frequently. Perhaps high exposure to computer \r\n[L271] screens increases the chance of eye cancer. In that case, the higher prevalence of \r\n[L272] eye cancer for heavier users of cell phones could be due to their higher use of com\ufffeputers, not their higher use of cell phones.\r\n[L273] By contrast, an experiment reduces the potential for lurking variables to affect \r\n[L274] the results. Why? We\u2019ll see that with a type of \u201crandom\u201d selection to determine \r\n[L275] which subjects receive each treatment, we are attempting to form and balance \r\n[L276] groups of subjects receiving the different treatments; that is, the groups have \r\n[L277] similar distributions on other variables, such as lifestyle, genetic, or health char\ufffeacteristics. For instance, suppose the researchers in cell phone Study 3 decided \r\n[L278] to have 24 subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and 23 subjects receive the \u201coff\u201d \r\n[L279] condition instead of having each subject receive both treatments. The health of \r\n[L280] the subjects could be a factor in how the brain responds to the treatments and \r\n[L281] the amount of brain activity that appears on the scans. If we randomly determine \r\n[L282] which subjects receive the \u201con\u201d condition and which do not, the two groups of \r\n[L283] subjects are expected to have similar distributions on health. One group will not \r\n[L284] be much healthier, on average, than the other group. When the groups are bal\ufffeanced on a lurking variable, there is no association between the lurking variable \r\n[L285] and the explanatory variable (for instance, between health of the subject and \r\n[L286] whether the subject receives the \u201con\u201d condition). Then, the lurking variable will \r\n[L287] not affect how the explanatory variable is associated with the response variable. \r\n[L288] One treatment group will not tend to have more brain activity because of health \r\n[L289] differences, on the average.\r\n[L290] In Study 3, described in Example 1, by using the same subjects for both treat\ufffements, the researchers were attempting to further control the variability from the \r\n[L291] subject\u2019s health. In this experimental study, it was important to randomize the \r\n[L292] order in which the subject received the treatment.\r\n[L293] Establishing cause and effect is central to science. But it\u2019s not possible to \r\n[L294] establish cause and effect definitively with observational studies. There\u2019s al\ufffeways the possibility that some lurking variable could be responsible for the \r\n[L295] association. If people who make greater use of cell phones have a higher rate of \r\n[L296] eye cancer, it may be because of some variable that we failed to measure in our \r\n[L297] study, such as computer use. As we learned in Section 3.4, association does not \r\n[L298] imply causation.\r\n[L299] Because it\u2019s easier to address the potential impact of lurking variables in an \r\n[L300] experiment than in an observational study, we can study the effect of an explan\ufffeatory variable on a response variable more accurately with an experiment than \r\n[L301] with an observational study. With an experiment, the researcher has control over \r\n[L302] which treatment each subject receives. If we find an association between the \r\n[L303] explanatory variable and the response variable, we can be more sure that we\u2019ve \r\n[L304] discovered a causal relationship than if we merely find an association in an ob\ufffeservational study. Consequently, the best method for determining causality is to \r\n[L305] conduct an experiment.\r\n[L306] 5HFDOO\r\n[L307] From Section 3.4, a lurking variable is \r\n[L308] a variable not observed in the study that \r\n[L309] influences the association between the \r\n[L310] response and explanatory variables due \r\n[L311] to its own association with each of those \r\n[L312] variables. b\r\n[L313] &DXWLRQ\r\n[L314] In Example 3, the problem with the \r\n[L315] conclusion they made is that schools with \r\n[L316] high rates of drug use might be more \r\n[L317] inclined to employ drug tests to address \r\n[L318] the problem. It is conceivable that drug \r\n[L319] tests reduced the rate of drug use from \r\n[L320] 0.74 to 0.37, cutting the rate in half. It is \r\n[L321] also conceivable that drug use rates started \r\n[L322] at 0.37 and didn\u2019t change at all due to \r\n[L323] the drug test program. The problem with \r\n[L324] this observational study is that we don\u2019t \r\n[L325] know which of the previous conceivable \r\n[L326] scenarios, or plethora of other ones, \r\n[L327] occurred. b","[L328] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 45>","[L329] 184 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L330] Determining Which Type of Study Is Possible\r\n[L331] If experiments are preferable, why ever conduct an observational study? Why \r\n[L332] bother to measure whether cell phone usage was greater for those with cancer \r\n[L333] than for those not having it? Why not instead conduct an experiment, such as \r\n[L334] the following: Pick half the students from your school at random and tell them to \r\n[L335] use a cell phone each day for the next 50 years. Tell the other half of the student \r\n[L336] body never to use cell phones. Fifty years from now, analyze whether cancer was \r\n[L337] more common for those who used cell phones.\r\n[L338] There are obvious difficulties with such an experiment:\r\n[L339] j It\u2019s not ethical for a study to expose over a long period of time some of the \r\n[L340] subjects to something (such as cell phone radiation) that we suspect may be \r\n[L341] harmful.\r\n[L342] j It\u2019s difficult in practice to make sure that the subjects behave as told. How can \r\n[L343] you monitor them to ensure that they adhere to their treatment assignment \r\n[L344] over the 50-year experimental period?\r\n[L345] j Who wants to wait 50 years to get an answer?\r\n[L346] For these reasons, medical experiments are often performed over a short time \r\n[L347] period or often with exposure to treatments that would not be out of the ordinary \r\n[L348] (such as a one-time exposure to cell phone activity). To measure the effects on \r\n[L349] people of longer exposure to potentially harmful treatments, often the experiment \r\n[L350] uses animals such as mice instead of people. Because inferences about human \r\n[L351] populations are more trustworthy when we use samples of human subjects than \r\n[L352] when we use samples of animal subjects, scientists often resort to observational \r\n[L353] studies. Then we are not deliberately placing people in harm\u2019s way, but observing \r\n[L354] people who have chosen on their own to take part in the activity of interest. In \r\n[L355] today\u2019s information age, a lot of data is readily available to assist (or impede) \r\n[L356] people from making decisions about the relationship between variables. These \r\n[L357] data provide only observational comparisons. We\u2019ll study methods for designing a \r\n[L358] good observational study in Section 4.4. This can yield useful information when an \r\n[L359] experiment is not practical.\r\n[L360] Finally, another reason nonexperimental studies are common is that many \r\n[L361] questions of interest do not involve trying to assess causality. For instance, if we \r\n[L362] want to gauge the public\u2019s opinion on some issue, or if we want to conduct a mar\ufffeketing study to see how people rate a new product, it\u2019s completely adequate to \r\n[L363] use a study that samples (appropriately) the population of interest.\r\n[L364] Using Data Already Available\r\n[L365] Of course, you will not conduct a study every time you want to answer some \r\n[L366] question, such as whether cell phone use is dangerous. It\u2019s human nature to rely \r\n[L367] instead on already available data. The most readily available data come from \r\n[L368] your personal observations. Perhaps a friend recently diagnosed with brain can\ufffecer was a frequent user of cell phones. Is this strong evidence that frequent cell \r\n[L369] phone use increases the likelihood of getting brain cancer?\r\n[L370] Informal observations of this type are called anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately, \r\n[L371] there is no way to tell whether they are representative of what happens for an en\ufffetire population. Sometimes you hear people give anecdotal evidence to attempt to \r\n[L372] disprove causal relationships. \u201cMy Uncle Geoffrey is 85 years old and he\u2019s smoked \r\n[L373] a pack of cigarettes a day for his entire adult life, yet he\u2019s as healthy as a horse.\u201d An \r\n[L374] association does not need to be perfect, however, to be causal. Not all people who \r\n[L375] smoke a pack of cigarettes each day will get lung cancer, but a much higher propor\ufffetion of them will do so than people who are nonsmokers. Perhaps Uncle Geoffrey \r\n[L376] is lucky to be in good health, but that should not encourage you to smoke regularly.\r\n[L377] A famous saying is, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Instead of using an\ufffeecdotal evidence to draw conclusions, you should rely on data from reputable \r\n[L378] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L379] Examples of sources for available data:\r\n[L380] j General Social Survey (GSS)\r\n[L381] j http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/\r\n[L382] j www.statcan.ca (for Canada)\r\n[L383] j www.inegi.gob.mx (for Mexico)\r\n[L384] j www.statistics.gov.uk (for United \r\n[L385] Kingdom)\r\n[L386] j www.abs.gov.au (for Australia)","[L387] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 45>","[L388] Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 185\r\n[L389] research studies.

The primary \r\n[L401] danger appears to be people using cell phones while driving!\r\n[L402] Sample Survey\r\n[L403] A sample survey selects a sample of subjects from a population and collects data from \r\n[L404] them. In the field of statistics a survey does not just indicate an opinion poll or a question\ufffenaire; it includes any information gathered from or about the subject.\r\n[L405] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study. The subjects provide data \r\n[L406] on the variable or variables measured. There is no assignment of subjects to differ\ufffeent treatments.\r\n[L407] Most countries conduct a regular census. A census attempts to count the \r\n[L408] number of people in the population and to measure certain characteristics about \r\n[L409] them. It is different from a sample survey, which selects only a small part of the \r\n[L410] entire population.\r\n[L411] In Article 1, Section 2, the U.S. Constitution states that a complete counting \r\n[L412] of the U.S. population is to be done every 10 years. The first census was taken in \r\n[L413] 1790. It counted 3.9 million people; today the U.S. population is estimated to be \r\n[L414] more than 300 million (308,745,538 by the 2010 U.S. census). Other than counting \r\n[L415] the population size, here are three key reasons for conducting the U.S. census:\r\n[L416] j The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives be ap\ufffeportioned to states based on their portion of the population measured by the \r\n[L417] census. When the 1910 census was completed, Congress fixed the number of \r\n[L418] seats at 435. With each new census, states may gain or lose seats, depending \r\n[L419] on how their population size compares with other states.\r\n[L420] j Census data are used in the drawing of boundaries for electoral districts.\r\n[L421] j Census data are used to determine the distribution of federal dollars to states \r\n[L422] and local communities.\r\n[L423] Although it\u2019s the intention of a census to sample everyone in a population, in \r\n[L424] practice this is not possible. Some people do not have known addresses for the \r\n[L425] census bureau to send a census form. Some people are homeless or transient. \r\n[L426] Because data are needed regularly on economic variables, such as the unem\ufffeployment rate, the U.S. Bureau of the Census continually takes samples of the \r\n[L427] population rather than relying solely on the complete census. An example is the \r\n[L428] monthly Current Population Survey, which surveys about 50,000 U.S. house\ufffeholds and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the \r\n[L429] United States, including the unemployment rate. It is usually more practical, in \r\n[L430] terms of time and money, to take a sample rather than to try to measure every\ufffeone in a population.","[L431] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 45>","[L432] 186 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L433] For a sample survey to be informative, it is important for the sample to reflect \r\n[L434] the population well.

A nationwide census is conducted \r\n[L616] in the United States every 10 years.\r\n[L617] a. Give at least two reasons the United States takes a census \r\n[L618] only every 10 years.\r\n[L619] 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample\r\n[L620] The sample survey is a common type of nonexperimental study. The first step of \r\n[L621] a sample survey is to define the population targeted by the study. For instance, \r\n[L622] the Gallup organization (www.gallup.com) conducts a monthly survey of about \r\n[L623] 1000 adult Americans. Gallup then reports the percentage of those sampled who \r\n[L624] respond \u201capprove\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way [the \r\n[L625] current president of the United States] is handling his job as president?\u201d If the \r\n[L626] sampling is conducted properly, this provides a good estimate of the approval \r\n[L627] rate within the entire population. The population consists of all adults living in \r\n[L628] the United States.\r\n[L629] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L630] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L631] Sampling Frame\r\n[L632] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L633] taken.\r\n[L634] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L635] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L636] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L637] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L638] of registered students.\r\n[L639] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L640] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L641] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L642] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L643] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L644] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L645] doubtful.\r\n[L646] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L647] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L648] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L649] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L650] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L651] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L652] be misleading.","[L653] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>","[L654] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L655] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L656] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L657] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L658] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L659] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L660] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L661] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L662] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L663] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L664] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L665] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L666] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L667] 5HFDOO\r\n[L668] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L669] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L670] called the sample size. b\r\n[L671] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L672] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L673] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L674] Simple random \r\n[L675] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L676] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L677] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L678] a dinner banquet and raffle. The Athletic Department has donated two pairs \r\n[L679] of football season tickets as prizes. The winners will be drawn randomly from \r\n[L680] everyone who purchased a ticket, and each ticket can win only once. (This is \r\n[L681] called sampling without replacement.) To select the two winners, the organiz\ufffeers choose a simple random sample of size n = 2 from the 60 ticket holders. \r\n[L682] Each individual at the banquet receives an entry with a number between 1 and \r\n[L683] 60. Duplicate tickets numbered 1 to 60 are placed in a container and mixed, \r\n[L684] after which the two winning entries are chosen at random. Whoever holds the \r\n[L685] tickets containing the same numbers as those drawn at random wins the foot\ufffeball tickets.\r\n[L686] Questions to Explore\r\n[L687] a. What are the possible samples?\r\n[L688] b. What is the chance that a particular sample of size 2 will be drawn?\r\n[L689] c. Professor Shaffer is in attendance at the banquet and holds entry num\ufffeber 1. What is the chance that her entry will be chosen? Mr. Chatterjee \r\n[L690] holds entry number 55. What is the chance that his entry will be chosen?\r\n[L691] Think It Through\r\n[L692] a. The entire collection of possible samples is too long to list, but we can \r\n[L693] visualize the possibilities by listing certain pairs:\r\n[L694] (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), . . . , (1,58), (1,59), (1,60)\r\n[L695] (2,3), (2,4), . . . , (2,58), (2,59), (2,60)\r\n[L696] .\r\n[L697] .\r\n[L698] .\r\n[L699] Example 4 ","[L700] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>","[L701] 190 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L702] Selecting a Simple Random Sample\r\n[L703] What\u2019s a better way to take a simple random sample than blindly drawing slips \r\n[L704] of paper out of a hat? You first number the subjects in the sampling frame. You \r\n[L705] then generate a set of those numbers randomly. Finally, you sample the subjects \r\n[L706] whose numbers were generated. One method of generating numbers randomly \r\n[L707] is to use a random number table. In practice, technology is used to generate the \r\n[L708] sample. This could be an app or a statistical program. The following example \r\n[L709] demonstrates how a random sample is generated in MINITAB (left column).\r\n[L710] Taking a Random Sample Consider taking a random sample of three students \r\n[L711] from a class in which the following students are enrolled: Aisha, Benedict, Chung, \r\n[L712] Diego, Emily, Francisco, Girish, Hank, Isabella, and Jing.\r\n[L713] It can be done in MINITAB, as shown below.\r\n[L714] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L715] The Random Numbers web app from \r\n[L716] the book\u2019s website can also be used to \r\n[L717] generate random numbers. The screenshot \r\n[L718] in the margin next to Example 5 on the next \r\n[L719] page illustrates. b\r\n[L720] (57,58), (57,59), (57,60)\r\n[L721] (58,59), (58,60)\r\n[L722] (59,60)\r\n[L723] b. The first row above contains 59 possible samples, the second row con\ufffetains 58, and so forth. There are thus 59 + 58 + c + 2 + 1, which \r\n[L724] equals 1770 possible samples. The process of randomly selecting two \r\n[L725] unique entries ensures that each possible sample of size 2 has an equal \r\n[L726] chance of occurring. Since there are 1770 possible samples, the chance \r\n[L727] of any one sample being selected is 1 out of 1770.\r\n[L728] c. Looking at the top row in part a, we see that 1 shows up in 59 of the \r\n[L729] samples (all of the samples listed in the top row).

There are better \r\n[L736] ways of selecting simple random samples, as we\u2019ll learn next.\r\n[L737] c Try Exercise 4.16","[L738] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://2a1ab342a4235ad#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_11.jpg","size_bytes":60206,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L739] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 45>","[L740] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 191\r\n[L741] When we executed this command in MINITAB, the following random sample \r\n[L742] was obtained. This would be your sample of size 3.\r\n[L743] Note that if you select a random sample, you will not necessarily get the same \r\n[L744] three people.\r\n[L745] Selecting a Simple \r\n[L746] Random Sample b Auditing a School District\r\n[L747] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L748] Local school districts must be prepared for annual visits from state auditors \r\n[L749] whose job is to verify the dollar amount of the accounts within the school \r\n[L750] district and determine whether the money is being spent appropriately. It \r\n[L751] is too time-consuming and expensive for auditors to review all accounts, \r\n[L752] so they typically review only some of them. So that a school district cannot \r\n[L753] anticipate which accounts will be reviewed, the auditors often take a simple \r\n[L754] random sample of the accounts.\r\n[L755] Questions to Explore\r\n[L756] a. How can the auditors use random numbers to select 10 accounts to \r\n[L757] audit in a school district that has 60 accounts?\r\n[L758] b. Why is it important for the auditors not to use personal judgment in \r\n[L759] selecting the accounts to audit?\r\n[L760] Think It Through\r\n[L761] a. The sampling frame consists of the 60 accounts. We first number the \r\n[L762] accounts 1 through 60. Alternatively, they could list the names of the \r\n[L763] accounts. The accounts MINITAB selected (see below for details of \r\n[L764] the process) were 56, 43, 35, 47, 15, 8, 31, 9, 33, and 36. We cannot \r\n[L765] verify that these numbers are randomly selected, but we know that the \r\n[L766] process used to generate them employs random selection.\r\n[L767] b. By using simple random sampling, the auditors hold the school district \r\n[L768] responsible for all accounts. If the auditors personally chose the ac\ufffecounts to audit, they might select certain accounts each year. A school \r\n[L769] district would soon learn which accounts they need to have in order \r\n[L770] and which accounts can be given less attention.\r\n[L771] Insight\r\n[L772] Likewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) randomly selects some tax re\ufffeturns for audit, so taxpayers cannot predict ahead of time whether they will \r\n[L773] be audited. For efficiency, the IRS samples a small proportion of tax returns \r\n[L774] with small amounts owed and a larger proportion of tax returns with high \r\n[L775] amounts owed. It does this because it cares about the total amount of tax \r\n[L776] revenue brought in.\r\n[L777] c Try Exercise 4.17\r\n[L778] Example 5 \r\n[L779] Methods of Collecting Data in Sample Surveys\r\n[L780] In Example 5, the subjects sampled were accounts. More commonly, they are \r\n[L781] people. For any survey, it is difficult to get a good sampling frame since a list of \r\n[L782] all adults in a population typically does not exist. So, it\u2019s necessary to pick a place \r\n[L783] where almost all people can be found\u2014a person\u2019s place of residence.\r\n[L784] Once we identify the desired sample for a survey, how do we contact the \r\n[L785] people to collect the data?

An advantage is that \r\n[L794] subjects are more likely to participate. A disadvantage is the cost. Also, some sub\ufffejects may not answer sensitive questions pertaining to opinions or lifestyle, such \r\n[L795] as alcohol and drug use, whether they have been victims of sexual abuse, or their \r\n[L796] HIV status that they might answer on a printed questionnaire.\r\n[L797] Telephone interview A telephone interview is like a personal interview but \r\n[L798] conducted over the phone. A main advantage is lower cost because no travel is \r\n[L799] involved. A disadvantage is that the interview might have to be short. Subjects \r\n[L800] generally aren\u2019t as patient on the phone and may hang up before starting or com\ufffepleting the interview.\r\n[L801] Self-administered questionnaire Subjects are requested to fill out a questionnaire \r\n[L802] mailed, e-mailed, or otherwise available online. An advantage is that it is cheaper \r\n[L803] than a personal interview. A disadvantage is that fewer people tend to participate.\r\n[L804] So which method is most used? Most major national polls that survey regularly \r\n[L805] to measure public opinion use the telephone interview. An example is the polls \r\n[L806] conducted by the Gallup organization. The General Social Survey is an exception, \r\n[L807] using personal interviews for its questionnaire, which is quite long.\r\n[L808] For telephone interviews, since the mid-1980s, many sample surveys have used \r\n[L809] random digit dialing to select households. The survey can then obtain a sample \r\n[L810] without having a sampling frame. In the United States, typically the area code \r\n[L811] and the 3-digit exchange are randomly selected from the list of all such codes and \r\n[L812] exchanges. Then, the last four digits are dialed randomly, and an adult is selected \r\n[L813] randomly within the household. Although this sampling design incorporates \r\n[L814] randomness, it is not a simple random sample because each sample is not equally \r\n[L815] likely to be chosen. (Do you see why not? Does everyone have a telephone, or \r\n[L816] exactly one telephone?)\r\n[L817] Sources of Potential Bias in Sample Surveys\r\n[L818] A variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some parts of \r\n[L819] the population over others. Then, results from the sample are not representative \r\n[L820] of the population and are said to exhibit bias.\r\n[L821] 'LG<RX.QRZ\"\r\n[L822] Besides Gallup, there are other polling \r\n[L823] groups that conduct national surveys, \r\n[L824] such\u00a0as the Pew Research Center (www.\r\n[L825] people-press.org) and Zogby International \r\n[L826] (www.zogby.com).

The main way \r\n[L836] this occurs is if the sample is not random. Another way it can occur is due to \r\n[L837] undercoverage\u2014having a sampling frame that lacks representation from parts of \r\n[L838] the population. A phone survey using landlines will not reach homeless people, \r\n[L839] prison inmates, or people who don\u2019t have landline phones. If its sampling frame \r\n[L840] consists of the names in a phone directory, it will not reach those who don\u2019t have \r\n[L841] landlines. Most major polling agencies use randomized dialing. Responses by \r\n[L842] those who are not in the sampling frame might be quite different from those who \r\n[L843] are in the frame. Bias resulting from the sampling method, such as nonrandom \r\n[L844] sampling or undercoverage, is called sampling bias.\r\n[L845] Nonresponse bias A second type of bias occurs when some sampled subjects \r\n[L846] cannot be reached or refuse to participate. This is called nonresponse bias. The \r\n[L847] subjects who are willing to participate may be different from the overall sample \r\n[L848] in some systematic way, perhaps having strong emotional convictions about the \r\n[L849] issues being surveyed. Even those who do participate may not respond to some \r\n[L850] questions, resulting in nonresponse bias due to missing data. All major surveys \r\n[L851] suffer from some nonresponse bias. The General Social Survey has a nonre\ufffesponse rate of about 20\u201330%. The nonresponse rate is much higher for many \r\n[L852] telephone surveys. By contrast, government-conducted surveys often have lower \r\n[L853] nonresponse rates. The Current Population Survey has a nonresponse rate of \r\n[L854] only about 7%. To reduce nonresponse bias, investigators try to make follow-up \r\n[L855] contact with the subjects who do not return questionnaires.\r\n[L856] Results have dubious worth when there is substantial nonresponse. For instance, \r\n[L857] in her best-selling and controversial book Women and Love (1987), author and \r\n[L858] feminist Shere Hite presented results of a survey of adult women in the United \r\n[L859] States. One of her conclusions was that 70% of women who had been married at \r\n[L860] least five years have extramarital affairs. She based this conclusion on responses to \r\n[L861] questionnaires returned from a sample of 4500 women. This sounds impressively \r\n[L862] large. However, the questionnaire was mailed to about 100,000 women. We cannot \r\n[L863] know whether this sample of 4.5% of the women who responded is representative \r\n[L864] of the 100,000 who received the questionnaire, much less the entire population of \r\n[L865] adult American women. In fact, Hite was criticized for her research methodology \r\n[L866] of using a nonrandom sample and the large nonresponse rate.\r\n[L867] Response bias A third type of potential bias is in the actual responses made. \r\n[L868] This is called response bias. An interviewer might ask the questions in a leading \r\n[L869] way, such that subjects are more likely to respond a certain way. Or, subjects may \r\n[L870] lie because they think their response is socially unacceptable, or they may give \r\n[L871] the response that they think the interviewer prefers.\r\n[L872] If you design an interview or questionnaire, you should strive to construct \r\n[L873] questions that are clear and understandable. Avoid questions that are confusing, \r\n[L874] long, or leading. The wording of a question can greatly affect the responses. A \r\n[L875] Roper poll was designed to determine the percentage of Americans who ex\ufffepress some doubt that the Holocaust occurred in World War II. In response to \r\n[L876] the question, \u201cDoes it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the \r\n[L877] Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?\u201d 22% said it was possible the \r\n[L878] Holocaust never happened. The Roper organization later admitted that the ques\ufffetion was worded in a confusing manner. When it asked, \u201cDoes it seem possible \r\n[L879] to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel \r\n[L880] certain that it happened?\u201d only 1% said it was possible it never happened.4\r\n[L881] Even the order in which questions are asked can dramatically influence re\ufffesults. One study5\r\n[L882]  asked, during the Cold War, \u201cDo you think the U.S. should let \r\n[L883] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L884] There is bias if the way in which \r\n[L885] the study was designed or the \r\n[L886] data were gathered made certain \r\n[L887] outcomes occur more or less often \r\n[L888] in the sample than they do in the \r\n[L889] population. For example, consider \r\n[L890] the population of adults in your \r\n[L891] home town. The results of an opinion \r\n[L892] survey asking about raising the sales \r\n[L893] tax to support public schools may \r\n[L894] be biased in the direction of raising \r\n[L895] taxes if you sample only educators \r\n[L896] or biased in the direction of lowering \r\n[L897] taxes if you sample only business \r\n[L898] owners. Alternatively, the results \r\n[L899] could be biased toward raising taxes \r\n[L900] if a higher proportion of educators \r\n[L901] responded than business owners.\r\n[L902] ,Q3UDFWLFH Be Alert for \r\n[L903] Potential Bias\r\n[L904] With any sample survey, carefully \r\n[L905] scrutinize the results.

Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L932] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L933] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L934] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L935] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L936] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L937] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L938] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L939] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L940] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L941] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L942] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L943] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L944] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L945] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L946] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L947] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L948] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L949] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L950] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L951] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L952] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L953] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L954] than the general population.\r\n[L955] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L956] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L957] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L958] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L959] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L960] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L961] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L962] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L963] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.","[L964] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>","[L965] Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L966] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L967] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L968] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L969] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L970] and Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\n[L971] because they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\n[L972] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L973] planned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n[L974] 2.3 million people returned the questionnaire. The Digest predicted that \r\n[L975] Landon would win, getting 57% of the vote. Instead, Landon actually got only \r\n[L976] 36%, and Roosevelt won in a landslide.\r\n[L977] Questions to Explore\r\n[L978] a. What was the population?\r\n[L979] b. How could the Literary Digest poll make such a large error, especially \r\n[L980] with such a huge sample size? What type of bias occurred in this poll?\r\n[L981] Think It Through\r\n[L982] a. The population was all registered voters in the United States in 1936.\r\n[L983] b. This survey had two severe problems:\r\n[L984] j Sampling bias due to undercoverage of the sampling frame and a \r\n[L985] nonrandom sample: In 1936, the United States was in the Great \r\n[L986] Depression. Those who had cars and country club memberships \r\n[L987] and thus received questionnaires tended to be wealthy. The wealthy \r\n[L988] tended to be primarily Republican, the political party of Landon. \r\n[L989] Many potential voters were not on the lists used for the sampling \r\n[L990] frame. There was also no guarantee that a subject in the sampling \r\n[L991] frame was a registered voter.\r\n[L992] j Nonresponse bias: Of the 10 million people who received question\ufffenaires, 7.7 million did not respond. As might be expected, those \r\n[L993] individuals who were unhappy with the incumbent (Roosevelt) were \r\n[L994] more likely to respond.\r\n[L995] Insight\r\n[L996] For this same election, a pollster who was getting his new polling agency off the \r\n[L997] ground surveyed 50,000 people and predicted that Roosevelt would win. Who \r\n[L998] was this pollster? George Gallup. The Gallup organization is still with us today. \r\n[L999] However, the Literary Digest went out of business soon after the 1936 election.6\r\n[L1000] c Try Exercise 4.24\r\n[L1001] Example 6 \r\n[L1002] A Large Sample Size Does Not Guarantee \r\n[L1003] an\u00a0Unbiased Sample\r\n[L1004] Many people think that as long as the sample size is large, it doesn\u2019t matter how \r\n[L1005] the sample was selected.

As another example, consider trying to estimate the \r\n[L1014] average grade point average (GPA) on your campus. If you select 10 students \r\n[L1015] from the library, you can produce an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs \r\n[L1016] (assuming those students who go to the library are studying more than those who \r\n[L1017] don\u2019t). If you, instead, gather a larger sample of 30 students from the library, you \r\n[L1018] still have an estimate that is biased toward higher GPAs. The larger sample size \r\n[L1019] did not fix the problem of sampling in the library. Many Internet surveys have \r\n[L1020] thousands of respondents, but a volunteer sample of thousands is not as good \r\n[L1021] as a random sample, even if that random sample is much smaller. We\u2019re almost \r\n[L1022] always better off with a simple random sample of 100 people than with a volunteer \r\n[L1023] sample of thousands of people.\r\n[L1024] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Sample Survey\r\n[L1025] j Identify the population of all the subjects of interest.\r\n[L1026] j Define a sampling frame, which attempts to list all the subjects in the population.\r\n[L1027] j Use a random sampling design, implemented using random numbers, to select n\r\n[L1028] subjects from the sampling frame.\r\n[L1029] j Be cautious about sampling bias due to nonrandom samples (such as volunteer \r\n[L1030] samples) and sample undercoverage, response bias from subjects not giving their \r\n[L1031] true response or from poorly worded questions, and nonresponse bias from refusal \r\n[L1032] of subjects to participate.\r\n[L1033] In Section 4.1 we learned that experimental studies are preferable to nonex\ufffeperimental studies but are not always possible. Some types of nonexperimental \r\n[L1034] studies have fewer potential pitfalls than others. For a sample survey with random \r\n[L1035] sampling, we can make inferences about the population of interest. By contrast, \r\n[L1036] with a study using a convenience sample, results apply only to those subjects actu\ufffeally observed. For this reason, some researchers use the term observational study\r\n[L1037] to refer only to studies that use available subjects (such as a convenience sample) \r\n[L1038] and not to sample surveys that randomly select their sample.\r\n[L1039] 4.15 Choosing officers A campus club consists of five officers: \r\n[L1040] president (P), vice president (V), secretary (S), treasurer \r\n[L1041] (T), and activity coordinator (A). The club can select two \r\n[L1042] officers to travel to New Orleans for a conference; for \r\n[L1043] fairness, they decide to make the selection at random. In \r\n[L1044] essence, they are choosing a simple random sample of size \r\n[L1045] n = 2.\r\n[L1046] a. What are the possible samples of two officers?\r\n[L1047] b.

First, let\u2019s recall the \r\n[L1222] definition of an experimental study from Section 4.1: We assign each subject to an \r\n[L1223] experimental condition, called a treatment. We then observe the outcome on the \r\n[L1224] response variable. The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L1225] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L1226] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L1227] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L1228] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L1229] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L1230] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1231] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L1232] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L1233] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L1234] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L1235] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L1236] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L1237] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L1238] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L1239] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L1240] would like to quit.\r\n[L1241] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L1242] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L1243] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L1244] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L1245]  You need \r\n[L1246] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L1247] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L1248] 8\r\n[L1249] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L1250] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.","[L1251] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>","[L1252] Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L1253] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L1254] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L1255] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L1256] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L1257] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L1258] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L1259] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L1260] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L1261] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L1262] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L1263] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L1264] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L1265] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L1266] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L1267] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L1268] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L1269] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse. If the relapse rate was 42% for \r\n[L1270] subjects who received antidepressants, then in comparing relapse rates for the \r\n[L1271] antidepressant and control groups, it makes a big difference how you define the \r\n[L1272] control group. Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n[L1273] 33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\n[L1274] compared to the placebo group.\r\n[L1275] In some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\n[L1276] than a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\n[L1277] an antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\n[L1278] It may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\n[L1279] patch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\n[L1280] a placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\n[L1281] nicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\n[L1282] Randomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\n[L1283] subjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\n[L1284] treatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\n[L1285] the study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\n[L1286] subconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\n[L1287] group that receives the antidepressant.\r\n[L1288] It is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\n[L1289] the 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\n[L1290] control group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\n[L1291] younger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\n[L1292] making them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\n[L1293] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L1294] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L1295] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L1296] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L1297] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L1298] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L1299] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L1300] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L1301] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L1302] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L1303] one treatment.","[L1304] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>","[L1305] 200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1306] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L1307] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L1308] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L1309] An analysis9\r\n[L1310]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L1311] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L1312] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L1313] studies having randomization and control groups. This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L1314] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L1315] 9\r\n[L1316] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L1317] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L1318] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L1319] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L1320] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L1321] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L1322] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L1323] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L1324] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L1325] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L1326] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L1327] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L1328] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L1329] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L1330] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L1331] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L1332] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L1333] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1334] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L1335] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L1336] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L1337] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L1338] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L1339] The other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\n[L1340] study observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\n[L1341] Questions to Explore\r\n[L1342] a.

They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\n[L1365] of the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\n[L1366] to the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group). The \r\n[L1367] procedure would be as follows:\r\n[L1368] j Number the study subjects from 001 to 429.\r\n[L1369] j Pick a three-digit random number between 001 and 429. If the num\ufffeber is 392, for example, then the subject numbered 392 is put in the \r\n[L1370] bupropion group.\r\n[L1371] j Continue to pick three-digit numbers until you\u2019ve picked 215 distinct \r\n[L1372] values between 001 and 429. This determines the 215 subjects who \r\n[L1373] will receive bupropion. The remaining 214 subjects will form the \r\n[L1374]  control group.\r\n[L1375] c. The description of the experiment in Picture the Scenario did not say \r\n[L1376] whether the subjects who did not receive bupropion were given a pla\ufffecebo or whether the study was blinded. If not, these would be potential \r\n[L1377] sources of bias. In addition, the definition of what it means to relapse or \r\n[L1378] abstain from smoking needs to be clearly defined.\r\n[L1379] Insight\r\n[L1380] In the actual reported study, the subjects were randomized to receive bupro\ufffepion or a placebo for 45 weeks. The study was double-blinded. This experimen\ufffetal study was well designed. The study results showed that at the end of one \r\n[L1381] year, 55% of the subjects receiving bupropion were not smoking, compared \r\n[L1382] with 42% in the placebo group. After 18 months, 48% of the bupropion subjects \r\n[L1383] were not smoking compared to 38% for the placebo subjects. However, after \r\n[L1384] two years, the percentage of nonsmokers was similar for the two groups, 42% \r\n[L1385] versus 40%.\r\n[L1386] c Try Exercise 4.32\r\n[L1387] ,Q3UDFWLFH The Randomized \r\n[L1388] Experiment in Medicine\r\n[L1389] In medicine, the randomized \r\n[L1390] experiment (clinical trial) has become \r\n[L1391] the gold standard for evaluating new \r\n[L1392] medical treatments.

But some studies mistakenly try to generalize \r\n[L1411] to a broader population than the one from which the sample was taken. A psy\ufffechologist may conduct an experiment using a sample of students from an intro\ufffeductory psychology course. For the results to be of wider interest, however, the \r\n[L1412] psychologist might claim that the conclusions generalize to all college students, \r\n[L1413] to all young adults, or even to all adults. Such generalizations may be wrong since \r\n[L1414] the sample may differ from those populations in fundamental ways such as in \r\n[L1415] average socioeconomic status, race, or gender, or attitudes.\r\n[L1416] SUMMARY: Key Parts of a Good Experiment\r\n[L1417] j A good experiment has a control comparison group, randomization in assigning \r\n[L1418] experimental units to treatments, and blinding.\r\n[L1419] j The experimental units are the subjects\u2014the people, animals, or other objects to \r\n[L1420] which the treatments are applied.\r\n[L1421] j The treatments are the experimental conditions imposed on the experimental \r\n[L1422] units. One of these may be a control (for instance, either a placebo or an existing \r\n[L1423] treatment) that provides a basis for determining whether a particular treatment is \r\n[L1424] effective. The treatments correspond to values of an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1425] j Randomly assign the experimental units to the treatments. This tends to balance \r\n[L1426] the comparison groups with respect to lurking variables.\r\n[L1427] j Replication of studies increases confidence in the conclusions.\r\n[L1428] Carefully assess the scope of conclusions in research articles, mass media, and \r\n[L1429] advertisements.

A team of researchers stud\ufffeied whether typing text messages, reading them, or a combi\ufffenation of both, while driving affect eye movements, stimulus \r\n[L1563] detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed \r\n[L1564] and headway significantly. A total sample of 977 participants \r\n[L1565] from 28 experimental studies was considered in the investi\ufffegation. Results show that typing and reading text messages \r\n[L1566] while driving adversely affected driver control ability.

This final section shows ways these methods are often \r\n[L1585] extended in practice so they are even more powerful. We\u2019ll first learn about \r\n[L1586] alternatives to simple random sampling in sample surveys and then about types \r\n[L1587] of observational studies that enable us to study questions for which experiments \r\n[L1588] with humans are not feasible. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to study the effects of two \r\n[L1589] or more explanatory variables with a single experiment.\r\n[L1590] Sample Surveys: Other Random Sampling \r\n[L1591] Designs\u00a0Useful in Practice\r\n[L1592] Simple random sampling gives every possible sample the same chance of selection. \r\n[L1593] In practice, more complex random sampling designs are often easier to implement \r\n[L1594] or are more efficient, requiring a smaller sampling size for the same precision. \r\n[L1595] Sometimes they are even preferable to simple random sampling.\r\n[L1596] Cluster random sampling To use simple random sampling, we need a sampling \r\n[L1597] frame\u2014the list of all, or nearly all, subjects in the population. In some cases, this \r\n[L1598] information is not available. It may be easier to identify clusters of subjects. A \r\n[L1599] study of residents of a country can identify counties or census tracts. A study of \r\n[L1600] students can identify schools. A study of the elderly living in institutions can iden\ufffetify nursing homes. We can obtain a sample by randomly selecting the clusters and \r\n[L1601] observing each subject in the clusters chosen.\r\n[L1602] For instance, suppose you would like to sample about 1% of the families in \r\n[L1603] your city. You could use city blocks as clusters. Using a map to label and number \r\n[L1604] city blocks, you could select a simple random sample of 1% of the blocks and \r\n[L1605] then select every family on each of those blocks for your observations.\r\n[L1606] Cluster Random Sample\r\n[L1607] Divide the population into a large number of clusters, such as city blocks. Select a simple \r\n[L1608] random sample of the clusters. Use the subjects in those clusters as the sample. This is a \r\n[L1609] cluster random sample.\r\n[L1610] For personal interviews, when the subjects within a cluster are close geograph\ufffeically, cluster sampling is less expensive per observation than simple random \r\n[L1611] sampling. By interviewing every family in a particular city block, you can obtain \r\n[L1612] many observations quickly and with little travel.\r\n[L1613] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Cluster \r\n[L1614] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1615] Cluster random sampling is a preferable sampling design if\r\n[L1616] j A reliable sampling frame is not available, or\r\n[L1617] j The cost of selecting a simple random sample is excessive.\r\n[L1618] The disadvantages are:\r\n[L1619] j We usually require a larger sample size with cluster sampling for the same level \r\n[L1620] of precision.\r\n[L1621] j Selecting a small number of clusters might result in a sample that is more homoge\ufffeneous than the population.","[L1622] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 45>","[L1623] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 205\r\n[L1624] Stratified random sampling Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean \r\n[L1625] number of hours a week that students in your school work on outside employ\ufffement. The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L1626] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L1627] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L1628] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L1629] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L1630] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L1631] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L1632] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L1633] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L1634] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L1635] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L1636] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L1637] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\n[L1638] each subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\n[L1639] in your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\n[L1640] students who work and who don\u2019t work. However, this information may not be \r\n[L1641] available for each student.\r\n[L1642] SUMMARY: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Stratified \r\n[L1643] Random\u00a0Sample\r\n[L1644] Stratified random sampling has the\r\n[L1645] j Advantage that you can include in your sample enough subjects in each group \r\n[L1646] (stratum) you want to evaluate.\r\n[L1647] j Disadvantage that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into \r\n[L1648] which each subject belongs.\r\n[L1649] What\u2019s the difference between a stratified sample and a cluster sample? A \r\n[L1650] stratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L1651] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L1652] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L1653] random sample).\r\n[L1654] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L1655] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L1656] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L1657] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L1658] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L1659] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L1660] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L1661] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L1662] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L1663] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L1664] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of ","[L1665] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>","[L1666] 206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1667] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L1668] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L1669] be infeasible.\r\n[L1670] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L1671] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L1672] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L1673] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L1674] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L1675] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L1676] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L1677] sampling. Similar formulas exist for other types of random sampling, but they are \r\n[L1678] complex and beyond the scope of this text.\r\n[L1679] Table 4.1 Summary of Random Sampling Methods\r\n[L1680] Method Description Advantages\r\n[L1681] Simple random \r\n[L1682] sample\r\n[L1683] Each possible sample is equally \r\n[L1684] likely\r\n[L1685] Sample tends to be a good \r\n[L1686] reflection of the population\r\n[L1687] Cluster random \r\n[L1688] sample\r\n[L1689] Identify clusters of subjects, \r\n[L1690] take\u00a0simple random sample \r\n[L1691] of the clusters\r\n[L1692] Do not need a sampling frame \r\n[L1693] of subjects, less expensive to \r\n[L1694] implement\r\n[L1695] Stratified random \r\n[L1696] sample\r\n[L1697] Divide population into groups \r\n[L1698] (strata), take simple random \r\n[L1699]  sample from each stratum\r\n[L1700] Ensures enough subjects in each \r\n[L1701] group that you want to compare\r\n[L1702] m Figure 4.2 Ways of Randomly Sampling 40 Students.

With an observational study, it\u2019s possible that an association \r\n[L1714] is due to some lurking variable. However, observational studies do have advan\ufffetages. It\u2019s often not practical to conduct an experiment. For instance, with human \r\n[L1715] subjects it\u2019s not ethical to design an experiment to study the long-term effect of \r\n[L1716] cell phone use on getting cancer. Nevertheless, it is possible to design an observa\ufffetional study that controls for identified lurking variables.\r\n[L1717] Rather than taking a cross section of a population at some time, such as with \r\n[L1718] a sample survey, some studies are backward looking (retrospective) or forward \r\n[L1719] looking (prospective). Observational studies in medicine are often retrospective. \r\n[L1720] How can we study whether there is an association between long-term cell phone \r\n[L1721] use and brain cancer if we cannot perform an experiment? We can form a sample \r\n[L1722] of subjects who have brain cancer and a similar sample of subjects who do not \r\n[L1723] and then compare the past use of cell phones for the two groups. This approach \r\n[L1724] was first applied to study smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1725] Retrospective \r\n[L1726] studies b Lung Cancer and Smoking\r\n[L1727] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1728] In 1950 in London, England, medical statisticians Austin Bradford Hill and \r\n[L1729] Richard Doll conducted one of the first studies linking smoking and lung cancer. \r\n[L1730] In 20 hospitals, they matched 709 patients admitted with lung cancer in the pre\ufffeceding year with 709 noncancer patients at the same hospital of the same gender \r\n[L1731] and within the same five-year grouping on age. All patients were queried about \r\n[L1732] their smoking behavior. A smoker was defined as a person who had smoked at \r\n[L1733] least one cigarette a day for at least a year. The study used a retrospective design \r\n[L1734] to look into the past in measuring the patients\u2019 smoking behavior.\r\n[L1735] Table 4.2 shows the results. The 709 cases in the first column of the table \r\n[L1736] were the patients with lung cancer. The 709 controls in the second column \r\n[L1737] were the matched patients without lung cancer.\r\n[L1738] Example 8 \r\n[L1739] Table 4.2 Results of Retrospective Study of Smoking and Lung Cancer\r\n[L1740] The cases had lung cancer.

The lung \r\n[L1757] cancer cases were more likely than the controls to have been smokers.\r\n[L1758] Insight\r\n[L1759] An inferential analysis showed that these results were statistically significant. \r\n[L1760] This suggested that an association exists between smoking and lung cancer.\r\n[L1761] c Try Exercise 4.46\r\n[L1762] Case-Control Study\r\n[L1763] A case-control study is a retrospective observational study in which subjects who have \r\n[L1764] a\u00a0response outcome of interest (the cases) and subjects who have the other response \r\n[L1765] outcome (the controls) are compared on an explanatory variable.\r\n[L1766] This is a popular design for medical studies in which it is not practical or \r\n[L1767] ethical to perform an experiment. We can\u2019t randomly assign subjects into a \r\n[L1768] smoking group and a nonsmoking group\u2014this would involve asking some sub\ufffejects to start smoking. Since we can\u2019t use randomization to balance effects of \r\n[L1769] potential lurking variables, usually the cases and controls are matched on such \r\n[L1770] variables. In Example 8, cases and controls were matched on their age, gender, \r\n[L1771] and hospital.\r\n[L1772] In a case-control study, the number of cases and the number of controls is \r\n[L1773] fixed. The random part is observing the outcome for the explanatory variable. \r\n[L1774] For instance, in Example 8, for the 709 patients of each type, we looked back in \r\n[L1775] time to see whether they smoked. We found percentages for the categories of \r\n[L1776] the explanatory variable (smoker, nonsmoker) given lung cancer status (cases \r\n[L1777] or control). It is not meaningful to form a percentage for a category of the re\ufffesponse variable. For example, we cannot estimate the population percentage of \r\n[L1778] subjects who have lung cancer, for smokers or nonsmokers. By the study design, \r\n[L1779] half the subjects had lung cancer. This does not mean that half the population \r\n[L1780] had lung cancer.\r\n[L1781] ,Q:RUGV\r\n[L1782] In Example 8, the response \r\n[L1783] outcome of interest was having lung \r\n[L1784] cancer. The cases had lung cancer, \r\n[L1785] the controls did not have lung \r\n[L1786] cancer, and they were compared on \r\n[L1787] the explanatory variable\u2014whether \r\n[L1788] the subject had been a smoker \r\n[L1789] (yes\u00a0or no).\r\n[L1790] Case-control \r\n[L1791] studies b Cell Phone Use\r\n[L1792] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1793] Studies 1 and 2 about cell phone use in Example 1 were both case-control \r\n[L1794] studies. In Study 2, the cases were brain cancer patients. The controls were \r\n[L1795] randomly sampled from general practitioner lists and were matched with the \r\n[L1796] cases on age, sex, and place of residence. In Study 1, the cases had a type of \r\n[L1797] eye cancer. In forming a sample of controls, Study 1 did not attempt to match \r\n[L1798] subjects with the cases.\r\n[L1799] Question to Explore\r\n[L1800] Why might researchers decide to match cases and controls on characteristics \r\n[L1801] such as age?\r\n[L1802] Example 9 ","[L1803] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>","[L1804] Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 209\r\n[L1805] Prospective studies A retrospective study, such as a case-control study, looks \r\n[L1806] into the past. By contrast, a prospective study follows its subjects into the future.\r\n[L1807] Think It Through\r\n[L1808] We\u2019ve seen that one way to balance groups on potential lurking variables \r\n[L1809] such as age is to randomize in assigning subjects to groups. However, these \r\n[L1810] were observational studies, not experiments. So it was not possible for the \r\n[L1811] researchers to use randomization to balance treatments on potential lurking \r\n[L1812] variables. Matching is an attempt to achieve the balance that randomization \r\n[L1813] provides.\r\n[L1814] When researchers fail to use relevant variables to match cases with con\ufffetrols, those variables could influence the results. They could mask the true \r\n[L1815] relationship. The results could suggest an association when actually there \r\n[L1816] is not one, or the reverse. Without matching, results are more susceptible to \r\n[L1817] effects of lurking variables.\r\n[L1818] Insight\r\n[L1819] The lack of matching in Study 1 may be one reason that the results from \r\n[L1820] the two studies differed, with Study 2 not finding an association and Study 1 \r\n[L1821] finding one. For example, in Study 1 suppose the eye cancer patients tended \r\n[L1822] to be older than the controls, and suppose older people tend to be heavier \r\n[L1823] users of cell phones. Then, age could be responsible for the observed associa\ufffetion between cell phone use and eye cancer.\r\n[L1824] c Try Exercise 4.47\r\n[L1825] Prospective studies b Nurses\u2019 Health\r\n[L1826] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1827] The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University,11\r\n[L1828] began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses age 30 to 55 years. The purpose of \r\n[L1829] the study was to explore relationships among diet, hormonal factors, smok\ufffeing habits, and exercise habits, and the risk of coronary heart disease, pul\ufffemonary disease, and stroke. Since the initial survey in 1976, the nurses have \r\n[L1830] filled out a questionnaire every two years.\r\n[L1831] Question to Explore\r\n[L1832] What does it mean for this observational study to be called prospective?\r\n[L1833] Think It Through\r\n[L1834] The retrospective smoking study in Example 8 looked to the past to learn \r\n[L1835] whether its lung cancer subjects had been smokers. By contrast, at the start \r\n[L1836] of the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, it was not known whether a particular nurse \r\n[L1837] would eventually have an outcome such as lung cancer. The study followed \r\n[L1838] each nurse into the future to see whether she developed that outcome and \r\n[L1839] to analyze whether certain explanatory variables (such as smoking) were \r\n[L1840] associated with it.\r\n[L1841] Example 10 \r\n[L1842] 11More information on this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00005152 and at \r\n[L1843] www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs.","[L1844] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 31 / 45>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://9817beec834ef81#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_30.jpg","size_bytes":69393,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L1845] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 45>","[L1846] 210 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L1847] Observational Studies and Causation\r\n[L1848] Can we ever definitively establish causation with an observational study? No, we \r\n[L1849] cannot. For example, because the smoking and lung cancer study in Example\u00a08 \r\n[L1850] was observational, cigarette companies argued that a lurking variable could \r\n[L1851] have caused this association. So why are doctors so confident in declaring that \r\n[L1852] smoking causes lung cancer? For a combination of reasons: (1) Experiments \r\n[L1853] conducted using animals have shown an association, (2) in many countries, over \r\n[L1854] time, female smoking has increased relative to male smoking, and the incidence \r\n[L1855] of lung cancer has increased in women compared to men. Other studies, both \r\n[L1856] retrospective and prospective, have added more evidence. For example, when a \r\n[L1857] prospective study begun in 1951 with 35,000 doctors ended in 2001, researchers12\r\n[L1858] estimated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who \r\n[L1859] never quit. This study estimated that at least half the people who smoke from \r\n[L1860] youth are eventually killed by their habit.\r\n[L1861] Most important, studies carried out on different populations of people have \r\n[L1862] consistently concluded that smoking is associated with lung cancer, even after ad\ufffejusting for all potentially confounding variables that researchers have suggested. \r\n[L1863] As more studies are done that adjust for confounding variables, the chance that a \r\n[L1864] lurking variable remains that can explain the association is reduced. As a conse\ufffequence, although we cannot definitively conclude that smoking causes lung can\ufffecer, physicians will not hesitate to tell you that they believe it does.

First, we\u2019ll learn \r\n[L1868] how a single experiment can help us analyze the effects of two explanatory vari\ufffeables at once.\r\n[L1869] Categorical explanatory variables in an experiment are often referred to as \r\n[L1870] factors. For example, consider the experiment described in Example 7 to study \r\n[L1871] whether taking an antidepressant can help a smoker stop smoking. The factor \r\n[L1872] Insight\r\n[L1873] Over the years, several analyses have been conducted using data from \r\n[L1874] the Nurses\u2019 Health Study. One finding (reported in The New York Times, \r\n[L1875] February 11, 2003) was that nurses in this study who were highly overweight \r\n[L1876] 18-year-olds were five times as likely as young women of normal weight to \r\n[L1877] need hip replacement later in life.\r\n[L1878] c Try Exercise 4.48\r\n[L1879] SUMMARY: Types of Nonexperimental Studies\r\n[L1880] j A retrospective study looks into the past.\r\n[L1881] j A prospective study identifies a group (cohort) of people and observes them in \r\n[L1882] the future.

The experiment could then have four treatment \r\n[L1899] groups that result from cross-classifying the two factors. See Figure 4.3.

Why not do one experiment \r\n[L1924] about bupropion and a separate experiment about the nicotine patch? The rea\ufffeson is that we can learn more from a two-factor experiment. For instance, the \r\n[L1925] combination of using both a nicotine patch and bupropion may be more effective \r\n[L1926] than using either method alone.\r\n[L1927] Multifactor \r\n[L1928] experiments b Antidepressants and/or Nicotine Patches\r\n[L1929] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L1930] Example 7 analyzed a study about whether bupropion helps a smoker quit \r\n[L1931] cigarettes.

Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L2005] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L2006] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L2007] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L2008] applied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\n[L2009] can\u2019t use many fields.\r\n[L2010] Blocking in an Experiment\r\n[L2011] The matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements. The migraine headache crossover study could investigate relief for sub\ufffejects who take a low dose of an oral drug, a high dose of that drug, and a placebo. \r\n[L2012] The crop yield study could have several fertilizer types.\r\n[L2013] In experiments with matching, a set of matched experimental units is referred \r\n[L2014] to as a block. A block design with random assignment of treatments to units \r\n[L2015] within blocks is called a randomized block design. In the migraine headache \r\n[L2016] study, each person is a block. In the crop yield study, each field is a block. A pur\ufffepose of using blocks is to provide similar experimental units for the treatments, \r\n[L2017] so they\u2019re on an equal footing in any subsequent comparisons.\r\n[L2018] To reduce possible bias, treatments are usually randomly assigned within a block.\r\n[L2019] In the migraine headache study, the order in which the treatments are taken would \r\n[L2020] be randomized. Bias could occur if all subjects received one treatment before an\ufffeother. An example of potential bias in a crossover study is a positive carry-over \r\n[L2021] effect if the first drug taken has lingering effects that can help improve results for \r\n[L2022] the second drug taken. Likewise, in a crop yield study, the fertilizers are randomly \r\n[L2023] assigned to the plots in a field.\r\n[L2024] culprit. They were also pioneers in developing a sound theo\uffferetical basis for the case-control method. They followed their \r\n[L2025] initial study with other case-control studies and with a long-term \r\n[L2026] prospective study that showed that smoking was not only the \r\n[L2027] predominant risk factor for lung cancer but also correlated with \r\n[L2028] other diseases.\r\n[L2029] At first, Bradford Hill was cautious about claiming that \r\n[L2030] smoking causes lung cancer. As the evidence mounted from \r\n[L2031] various studies, he accepted the causal link as being overwhelm\ufffeingly the most likely explanation. An influential article written \r\n[L2032] by Bradford Hill in 1965 proposed criteria that should be sat\ufffeisfied before you conclude that an association reflects a causal \r\n[L2033] link. For his work, in 1961 Austin Bradford Hill was knighted by \r\n[L2034] Queen Elizabeth. Richard Doll was knighted in 1971.\r\n[L2035] In the mid-20th century, Austin Bradford Hill was Britain\u2019s \r\n[L2036] leading medical statistician. In 1946, to assess the effect of strep\ufffetomycin in treating pulmonary tuberculosis, he designed what is \r\n[L2037] now regarded as the first controlled randomized medical exper\ufffeiment. About that time, doctors noticed the alarming increase \r\n[L2038] in the number of lung cancer cases. The cause was unknown \r\n[L2039] but suspected to be atmospheric pollution, particularly coal \r\n[L2040] smoke. In 1950, Bradford Hill and medical doctor and epidemi\ufffeologist Richard Doll published results of the case-control study \r\n[L2041] (Example 8) that identified smoking as a potentially important \r\n[L2042] How did statisticians become pioneers \r\n[L2043] in examining the effects of\u00a0smoking on \r\n[L2044] lung cancer?\r\n[L2045] On the Shoulders of. . .Austin Bradford Hill (1897\u20131991) \r\n[L2046] and Richard Doll (1912\u20132005) ","[L2047] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 36 / 45>","[L2048] 214 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L2049] 4.42 Student loan debt A researcher wants to compare \r\n[L2050]  student loan debt for students who attend four-year public \r\n[L2051] universities with those who attend four-year private uni\ufffeversities.

The sports website ESPN.com asked visitors \r\n[L2289] of the site which team would win the Southeast region. \r\n[L2290] CHAPTER SUMMARY \r\n[L2291] This chapter introduced methods for gathering data.\r\n[L2292] j An experiment assigns subjects to experimental conditions (such \r\n[L2293] as drug or placebo) called treatments. These are categories of \r\n[L2294] the explanatory variable. The outcome on the response variable \r\n[L2295] is then observed for each subject.\r\n[L2296] j An observational study is a type of nonexperimental study \r\n[L2297] that observes subjects on the response and explanatory vari\ufffeables. The study samples the population of interest, but merely \r\n[L2298] observes rather than applies treatments to those subjects.\r\n[L2299] Since association does not imply causation, with observational \r\n[L2300] studies we must be aware of potential lurking variables that \r\n[L2301] influence the association. In an experiment, a researcher uses \r\n[L2302] randomization in assigning experimental units (the subjects) \r\n[L2303] to the treatments. This helps balance the treatments on lurking \r\n[L2304] variables. A randomized experiment can provide support for \r\n[L2305] causation. To reduce bias, experiments should be double-blind, \r\n[L2306] with neither the subject nor the data collector knowing to which \r\n[L2307] treatment a subject was assigned.\r\n[L2308] A sample survey is a type of nonexperimental study that takes \r\n[L2309] a sample from a population. Good methods for selecting samples \r\n[L2310] incorporate random sampling.\r\n[L2311] j A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one \r\n[L2312] in which each possible sample of size n has the same chance of \r\n[L2313] being selected.\r\n[L2314] j A cluster random sample takes a simple random sample of \r\n[L2315] clusters (such as city blocks) and uses subjects in those clusters \r\n[L2316] as the sample.\r\n[L2317] j A stratified random sample divides the population into separate \r\n[L2318] groups, called strata, and then selects a simple random sample \r\n[L2319] from each stratum.\r\n[L2320] Be cautious of results from studies that use a convenience sample, \r\n[L2321] such as a volunteer sample, which Internet polls use. Even with \r\n[L2322] random sampling, biases can occur due to sample undercoverage, \r\n[L2323] nonresponse by many subjects in the sample, and responses that \r\n[L2324] are biased because of question wording or subjects\u2019 lying.\r\n[L2325] Most sample surveys take a cross section of subjects at a partic\ufffeular time. A census is a complete enumeration of an entire popula\ufffetion. Prospective studies follow subjects into the future, as is true \r\n[L2326] with many experiments. Medical studies often use retrospective\r\n[L2327] observational studies, which look at subjects\u2019 behavior in the past.\r\n[L2328] j A case-control study is an example of a retrospective study. \r\n[L2329] Subjects who have a response outcome of interest, such as \r\n[L2330] cancer, serve as cases. Other subjects not having that outcome \r\n[L2331] serve as controls. The cases and controls are compared on an \r\n[L2332] explanatory variable, such as whether they had been smokers.\r\n[L2333] A categorical explanatory variable in an experiment is also called a \r\n[L2334] factor. Multifactor experiments have at least two explanatory vari\ufffeables. With a completely randomized design, subjects are assigned \r\n[L2335] randomly to categories of each explanatory variable. Some designs \r\n[L2336] instead use blocks\u2014sets of experimental units that are matched. \r\n[L2337] Matched-pairs designs have two observations in each block. Often \r\n[L2338] this is the same subject observed for each of two treatments, such as \r\n[L2339] in a crossover study.\r\n[L2340] Data are only as good as the method used to obtain them. \r\n[L2341] Unless we use a good study design, conclusions may be faulty.","[L2342] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 39 / 45>","[L2343] Chapter Problems 217\r\n[L2344] c.

Meanwhile, the \r\n[L2641] percentage of the population who has tried marijuana \r\n[L2642] has increased dramatically in the United States over the \r\n[L2643] past 50 years, whereas the percentage of the population \r\n[L2644] affected by schizophrenia has remained constant at about \r\n[L2645] 1%.

When patients enrolling in the study are told the \r\n[L2685]  purpose of the study, explain why they may be reluc\ufffetant to be randomly assigned to one of the treatments.\r\n[L2686] c. If a researcher planning the study thinks the new treat\ufffement is likely to be better, explain why he or she may \r\n[L2687] have an ethical dilemma in proceeding with the study.\r\n[L2688] 4.92 Compare smokers with nonsmokers Example 8 and \r\n[L2689] Table 4.2 described a case-control study on smoking and \r\n[L2690] lung cancer. Explain carefully why it is not sensible to use \r\n[L2691] the study\u2019s proportion of smokers who had lung cancer \r\n[L2692] (that is, 688> 1688 + 6502) and proportion of nonsmokers \r\n[L2693] who had lung cancer 121> 121 + 5922 to estimate corre\ufffesponding proportions of smokers and nonsmokers who \r\n[L2694] have lung cancer in the overall population.\r\n[L2695] 4.93 Is a vaccine effective? A vaccine is claimed to be \r\n[L2696]  effective in preventing a rare disease that occurs in about \r\n[L2697] one of every 100,000 people. Explain why a randomized \r\n[L2698] clinical trial comparing 100 people who get the vaccine \r\n[L2699] to 100 people who do not get it is unlikely to be worth \r\n[L2700] doing.

Explain.\r\n[L2709] 4.86 Judging sampling design In each of the following situa\ufffetions, summarize negative aspects of the sample design.\r\n[L2710] a. A newspaper asks readers to vote at its Internet \r\n[L2711] site to determine whether they believe government \r\n[L2712] expenditures should be reduced by cutting social \r\n[L2713]  programs. Based on 1434 votes, the newspaper \r\n[L2714]  reports that 93% of the city\u2019s residents believe that \r\n[L2715] social programs should be reduced.\r\n[L2716] b. A congresswoman reports that letters to her office are \r\n[L2717] running 3 to 1 in opposition to the passage of stricter \r\n[L2718] gun control laws. She concludes that approximately 75% \r\n[L2719] of her constituents oppose stricter gun control laws.\r\n[L2720] c. An anthropology professor wants to compare attitudes \r\n[L2721] toward premarital sex of physical science majors and \r\n[L2722] social science majors. She administers a question\ufffenaire to her Anthropology 437, Comparative Human \r\n[L2723] Sexuality class. She finds no appreciable difference in \r\n[L2724] attitudes between the two majors, so she concludes \r\n[L2725] that the two student groups are about the same in their \r\n[L2726] views about premarital sex.\r\n[L2727] d. A questionnaire is mailed to a simple random sample \r\n[L2728] of 500 household addresses in a city. Ten are returned as \r\n[L2729] bad addresses, 63 are returned completed, and the rest \r\n[L2730] are not returned. The researcher analyzes the 63\u00a0cases \r\n[L2731] and reports that they represent a \u201csimple random \r\n[L2732]  sample of city households.\u201d\r\n[L2733] 4.87 More poor sampling designs Repeat the previous exercise \r\n[L2734] for the following scenarios:\r\n[L2735] a. A principal in a large high school wants to sample \r\n[L2736]  student attitudes toward a proposal that seniors must \r\n[L2737] pass a general achievement test to graduate. She lists all \r\n[L2738] of the first-period classes. Then, using a random num\ufffeber table, she chooses a class at random and interviews \r\n[L2739] every student in that class about the proposed test.\r\n[L2740] b. A new restaurant opened in January. In June, after \r\n[L2741] six months of operation, the owner applied for a loan \r\n[L2742] to improve the building. The loan application asked \r\n[L2743] for the annual gross income of the business. The \r\n[L2744] owner\u2019s record book contains receipts for each day \r\n[L2745] of operation since opening. She decides to calculate \r\n[L2746] the average daily receipt based on a sample of the \r\n[L2747] daily records and multiply that by the number of days \r\n[L2748] of operation in a year. She samples every Friday\u2019s \r\n[L2749] record. The average daily receipt for this sample was \r\n[L2750] then used to estimate the yearly receipts.\r\n[L2751] 4.88 Age for legal alcohol You want to investigate the opin\ufffeions students at your school have about whether the age \r\n[L2752] for legal drinking of alcohol should be 18.\r\n[L2753] a. Write a question to ask about this in a sample survey \r\n[L2754] in such a way that results would be biased.

This result suggests it is better not to use randomiza\ufffetion in medical studies because it is harder to show \r\n[L2759] that new ideas are beneficial.\r\n[L2760] b. Some newspaper articles that suggest a particular food, \r\n[L2761] drug, or environmental agent is harmful or beneficial \r\n[L2762] should be viewed skeptically unless we learn more \r\n[L2763] about the statistical design and analysis for the study.\r\n[L2764] c. This result shows the value of case-control studies \r\n[L2765] over randomized studies.\r\n[L2766] d. The randomized studies were poorly conducted, \r\n[L2767] or\u00a0they would have found the new treatment to be \r\n[L2768] better much more than 9% of the time.\r\n[L2769] 4.99 Multiple choice: Opinion and question wording \r\n[L2770] A recent General Social Survey asked subjects whether \r\n[L2771] they supported legalized abortion in each of seven cir\ufffecumstances. The percentage who supported legalization \r\n[L2772] varied between 44.6% (if the woman is not married) to \r\n[L2773] 88.6% (if the woman\u2019s health is seriously endangered \r\n[L2774] by the pregnancy). This indicates that\r\n[L2775] a. Responses can depend greatly on the question \r\n[L2776] wording.\r\n[L2777] b. Nonexperimental studies can never be trusted.\r\n[L2778] c. The sample must not have been randomly selected.\r\n[L2779] d. The sample must have had problems with response bias.\r\n[L2780] 4.100 Multiple choice: Campaign funding When the \r\n[L2781] Yankelovich polling organization asked, \u201cShould laws \r\n[L2782] be passed to eliminate all possibilities of special interests \r\n[L2783] giving huge sums of money to candidates?\u201d 80% of the \r\n[L2784] sample answered yes. When they posed the question, \r\n[L2785] \u201cShould laws be passed to prohibit interest groups from \r\n[L2786] contributing to campaigns, or do groups have a right to \r\n[L2787] contribute to the candidate they support?\u201d only 40% said \r\n[L2788] yes (Source: A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper, by \r\n[L2789] J.

Each infant in the study was shown two \r\n[L2813] videos. One video included a figure performing a help\ufffeing action and the other included a figure performing a \r\n[L2814] hindering action. Infants were presented with two toys \r\n[L2815] resembling the helping and hindering figures from the \r\n[L2816] videos and allowed to choose one of the toys to play with. \r\n[L2817] The researchers conjectured that, even at a very young \r\n[L2818] age, the infants would tend to choose the helpful object.\r\n[L2819] a. How might the results of this study been biased had \r\n[L2820] each infant been shown the video with the helpful figure \r\n[L2821] before being shown the video with the hindering figure?\r\n[L2822] b. How could such a potential bias be eliminated?\r\n[L2823] 4.95 Distinguish helping and hindering among infants, \r\n[L2824]  continued In the previous exercise, we considered how \r\n[L2825] showing each baby in the study the two videos in the \r\n[L2826] same order might create a bias. In fact, of the 16 babies \r\n[L2827] in the study, half were shown the videos in one order \r\n[L2828] while the other half was shown the videos in the opposite \r\n[L2829]  order. Explain how to use the Random Numbers web app \r\n[L2830] to randomly divide the 16 infants into two groups of 8.\r\n[L2831] 4.96 Distinguish helping and hindering among infants, \r\n[L2832]  continued Fourteen of the 16 infants in the Yale study \r\n[L2833] elected to play with a toy resembling the helpful figure as \r\n[L2834] opposed to one resembling the hindering figure. Is this \r\n[L2835] convincing evidence that infants tend to prefer the helpful \r\n[L2836] figure? Use the Random Numbers web app on the book\u2019s \r\n[L2837] website to investigate the approximate likelihood of the \r\n[L2838] observed results of 14 out of 16 infants choosing the help\ufffeful figure, if in fact infants are indifferent between the two \r\n[L2839] figures.

(Hint: When you sample \r\n[L2880] individuals, explain why you are more likely to sample \r\n[L2881] a large family than a small family.

Capture\u2013 \r\n[L2888] recapture is one method for doing this. A biologist \r\n[L2889] wants to count the deer population in a certain region. \r\n[L2890] She captures 50 deer, tags each, and then releases them. \r\n[L2891] Several weeks later, she captures 125 deer and finds \r\n[L2892] that 12 of them were tagged. Let N = population size,\r\n[L2893] M = size of first sample, n = size of second sample, \r\n[L2894] R = number tagged in second sample.

It states that \u201cresearch \r\n[L2905] for the Bar found that over 40 percent of female junior \r\n[L2906] tenants said they had encountered sexual harassment \r\n[L2907] during their time at the Bar.\u201d This was based on a study \r\n[L2908] conducted at the University of Sheffield that sent a \r\n[L2909] questionnaire to 334 junior tenants at the Bar, of whom \r\n[L2910] 159 responded. Of the 159, 67 were female. Of those \r\n[L2911] females, 3 said they had experienced sexual harassment \r\n[L2912] as a major problem, and 24 had experienced it as a slight \r\n[L2913] problem.\r\n[L2914] a. The quoted statement might be misleading because \r\n[L2915] the nonresponse was large.\r\n[L2916] b. No one was forced to respond, so everyone had a \r\n[L2917] chance to be in the sample, which implies it was a \r\n[L2918] simple random sample.\r\n[L2919] c. This was an example of a completely randomized \r\n[L2920]  experiment, with whether a female junior tenant \r\n[L2921]  experienced sexual harassment as the response \r\n[L2922] variable.\r\n[L2923] d. This was a retrospective case-control study, with those \r\n[L2924] who received sexual harassment as the cases.\r\n[L2925] 4.103 Multiple choice: Effect of response categories A study \r\n[L2926] (N.

When the possible \r\n[L2929] responses were the six categories (up to 1\r\n[L2930] 2 hour, 1\r\n[L2931] 2 to 1 hour, \r\n[L2932] 1 to 11\r\n[L2933] 2 hours, . . . , more than 21\r\n[L2934] 2 hours), 16% of respondents \r\n[L2935] said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2936] 2 hours per day. When the \r\n[L2937] six categories were (up to 21\r\n[L2938] 2 hours, 21\r\n[L2939] 2 to 3 hours, . . . , more \r\n[L2940] than 4 hours), 38% said they watched more than 21\r\n[L2941] 2 hours \r\n[L2942] per day.\r\n[L2943] a. The samples could not have been random, or this \r\n[L2944] would not have happened.\r\n[L2945] b. This shows the importance of question design, especially \r\n[L2946] when people may be uncertain what the answer to the \r\n[L2947] question really is.\r\n[L2948] c. This study was an experiment, not an observational \r\n[L2949] study.\r\n[L2950] 4.104 Systematic sampling A researcher wants to select 1% of \r\n[L2951] the 10,000 subjects from the sampling frame. She selects \r\n[L2952] subjects by picking one of the first 100 on the list at ran\ufffedom, skipping 100 names to get the next subject, skipping \r\n[L2953] another 100 names to get the next subject, and so on. \r\n[L2954] This is called a systematic random sample.\r\n[L2955] a. With simple random sampling, (i) every subject is equally \r\n[L2956] likely to be chosen, and (ii) every possible sample of size \r\n[L2957] n is equally likely. Indicate which, if any, of (i) and (ii) \r\n[L2958] are true for systematic random samples. Explain.\r\n[L2959] In First Sample?\r\n[L2960] Yes (tagged) No (not tagged) Total\r\n[L2961] In Second Yes R n\r\n[L2962] Sample? No\r\n[L2963] Total M N\r\n[L2964] a. Identify the values of M, n, and R for the biologist\u2019s \r\n[L2965] experiment.\r\n[L2966] b. One way to estimate N lets the sample proportion of \r\n[L2967] tagged deer equal the population proportion of tagged \r\n[L2968] deer. Explain why this means that\r\n[L2969] R\r\n[L2970] n = M\r\n[L2971] N\r\n[L2972] and, hence, that the estimated population size is \r\n[L2973] N = 1M * n2 >R\r\n[L2974] c. Estimate the number of deer in the deer population \r\n[L2975] using the numbers given.\r\n[L2976] d. The U.S. Bureau of the Census uses capture\u2013recapture \r\n[L2977] to make adjustments to the census by estimating the \r\n[L2978] undercount. The capture phase is the census itself \r\n[L2979] (persons are \u201ctagged\u201d by having returned their census \r\n[L2980] form and being recorded as counted), and the recap\ufffeture phase (the second sample) is the postenumerative \r\n[L2981] survey (PES) conducted after the census.

Pour the Cheddar Goldfish into \r\n[L2990] a paper bag, which represents the pond. Sample 10 of \r\n[L2991] them. For this initial sample, use Pretzel Goldfish to \r\n[L2992] replace them, to represent the tagged fish. Then select a \r\n[L2993] second sample and derive an estimate for N, the number \r\n[L2994] of Cheddar Goldfish in the original bag.

A particular value of center is \r\n[L3007] the mean area of the states. A map and a list of the states \r\n[L3008] with their areas (in square miles) are shown in the figure \r\n[L3009] and table that follow. Area for a state includes dry land \r\n[L3010] and permanent inland water surface.\r\n[L3011] Although we could use these data to calculate the actual \r\n[L3012] mean area, let\u2019s explore how well sampling performs \r\n[L3013] in estimating the mean area by sampling five states and \r\n[L3014] finding the sample mean.\r\n[L3015] a. The most convenient sampling design is to use our \r\n[L3016] eyes to pick five states from the map that we think \r\n[L3017] have areas representative of all the states. Do this, \r\n[L3018] picking five states that you believe have areas rep\uffferesentative of the actual mean area of the states. \r\n[L3019] Compute their sample mean area.\r\n[L3020] b.

Medical experiments often do this to compare treat\ufffements for chronic conditions that do not have a permanent cure.\r\n[L3] To illustrate, suppose a study plans to compare an oral drug and a placebo for \r\n[L4] treating migraine headaches. The subjects could take one treatment the first time \r\n[L5] they get a migraine headache and the other treatment the second time they get \r\n[L6] a migraine headache. The response is whether the subject\u2019s pain is relieved.

Question A three-factor design \r\n[L29] could also incorporate whether a subject receives counseling to discourage smoking. \r\n[L30] What would such a diagram look like?\r\n[L31] with a nicotine patch. We\u2019ll explore the results in Exercise 4.72. If we in\ufffecluded a third factor of whether the subject receives counseling, we would \r\n[L32] have three factors with 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 treatments to compare.\r\n[L33] c Try Exercise 4.50\r\n[L34] 5HFDOO\r\n[L35] This study is double-blind if both the \r\n[L36] subjects and the evaluator(s) of the subjects \r\n[L37] do not know whether the pill is active and \r\n[L38] whether the patch is active. b\r\n[L39] Subject Drug Placebo\r\n[L40] 1 Relief No relief d first matched pair\r\n[L41] 2 Relief Relief\r\n[L42] 3 No relief No relief\r\n[L43] For the entire sample, we would compare the percentage of subjects who have \r\n[L44] pain relief with the drug to the percentage who have pain relief with the placebo. \r\n[L45] The two observations for a particular subject are called a matched pair because \r\n[L46] they both come from the same person.\r\n[L47] A matched-pairs design in which subjects cross over during the experiment \r\n[L48] from using one treatment to using another treatment is called a crossover design. \r\n[L49] Crossover design helps remove certain sources of potential bias. Using the same \r\n[L50] subjects for each treatment keeps potential lurking variables from affecting the <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 35 / 45>Section 4.4 Other Ways to Conduct Experimental and\u00a0Nonexperimental Studies 213\r\n[L51] results because those variables take the same values for each treatment. For in\ufffestance, any difference observed between the drug and the placebo responses is \r\n[L52] not because subjects taking the drug had better overall health. Another example \r\n[L53] of a matched pair, crossover design is Study 3 discussed in Example 1.\r\n[L54] An additional application of a matched-pairs design occurs in agricultural ex\ufffeperiments that compare the crop yield for two fertilizer types. In each field, two \r\n[L55] plots are marked, one for each fertilizer. Two plots in the same field are likely to \r\n[L56] be more similar in soil quality and moisture than two plots from different fields. \r\n[L57] If we instead used a completely randomized design to assign entire fields to each \r\n[L58] fertilizer treatment, there\u2019s the possibility that by chance one fertilizer will be \r\n[L59] applied to fields that have better soil. This is especially true when the experiment \r\n[L60] can\u2019t use many fields.\r\n[L61] Blocking in an Experiment\r\n[L62] The matched-pairs design extends to the comparison of more than two treat\ufffements.\n# \u30101\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file1\ue201\nMclick Target: \"13:1\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] For these and other statistical \r\n[L2] analyses to be useful, we must have \u201cgood data.\u201d But what\u2019s the best way to \r\n[L3] gather data to ensure they are \u201cgood\u201d?

How can you design the study \r\n[L11] to be efficient?\r\n[L12] 4. What types of biases or lurking \r\n[L13] variables might exist?\r\n[L14] Thinking Ahead\r\n[L15] A knowledge of different study de\ufffesigns for gathering data helps us un\ufffederstand how contradictory results \r\n[L16] can happen in scientific research \r\n[L17] studies and determine which studies \r\n[L18] deserve our trust. In this chapter, we\u2019ll \r\n[L19] learn that the study design can have \r\n[L20] a major impact on its results. Unless \r\n[L21] the study is well designed and im\ufffeplemented, the results may be mean\ufffeingless or, worse yet, misleading. \r\n[L22] Throughout Chapter 4, we will return \r\n[L23] to the cell phone studies introduced in \r\n[L24] Example 1 to ask more questions and \r\n[L25] understand how study design can af\ufffefect what are appropriate conclusions \r\n[L26] to infer from an analysis of the data.\r\n[L27] 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies\r\n[L28] We use statistics to learn about a population. The German and British studies in \r\n[L29] Example 1 examined subjects\u2019 cell phone use and whether the subjects had brain \r\n[L30] or eye cancer. Since it would be too costly and time-consuming to seek out all\r\n[L31] individuals in the populations of Germany or Great Britain, the researchers used \r\n[L32] samples to gather data. These studies, like many, have two variables of primary \r\n[L33] interest\u2014a response variable and an explanatory variable. The response variable \r\n[L34] is whether a subject has cancer (eye or brain). The explanatory variable is the \r\n[L35] amount of cell phone use.\r\n[L36] Types of Studies: Experimental and Observational\r\n[L37] Some studies, such as Study 3 in Example 1, perform an experiment. Subjects are \r\n[L38] assigned to experimental conditions, such as when both cell phones are deacti\ufffevated (\u201coff\u201d condition) or the right cell phone is activated (\u201con\u201d condition), that \r\n[L39] we want to compare on the response outcome. These experimental conditions are \r\n[L40] called treatments. They correspond to different values of the explanatory variable.\r\n[L41] 5HFDOO\r\n[L42] From Section 1.2, the population consists \r\n[L43] of all the subjects of interest. We collect \r\n[L44] data on a subset of the population, which \r\n[L45] we call the sample.\r\n[L46] From the beginning of Chapter 3, the \r\n[L47] response variable measures the outcome \r\n[L48] of interest. Studies investigate how that \r\n[L49] outcome depends on the explanatory \r\n[L50] variable. b\r\n[L51] Experimental Study\r\n[L52] A researcher conducts an experimental study, or more simply, an experiment, by assigning \r\n[L53] subjects to certain experimental conditions and then observing outcomes on the response \r\n[L54] variable (or variables). The experimental conditions, which correspond to assigned values of \r\n[L55] the explanatory variable, are called treatments.\r\n[L56] For example, Study 3 used 47 participants as the subjects. In this experimental \r\n[L57] study, each participant was assigned to both treatments. These are the categories <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 45>Section 4.1 Experimental and Observational Studies 181\r\n[L58] of the explanatory variable, whether the cell phone is off or on.

The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L22] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L23] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L24] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L25] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L26] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L27] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L28] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L29] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L30] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L31] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L32] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L33] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\n[L34] each subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\n[L35] in your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\n[L36] students who work and who don\u2019t work.

The goal of the experiment is to investigate the association\u2014\r\n[L3] how the treatment affects the response. An advantage of an experimental study \r\n[L4] over a nonexperimental study is that it provides stronger evidence for causation.\r\n[L5] In an experiment, subjects are often referred to as experimental units. This \r\n[L6] name emphasizes that the objects measured need not be human beings. They \r\n[L7] could, for example, be schools, stores, mice, or computer chips.\r\n[L8] The Elements of a Good Experiment\r\n[L9] Let\u2019s consider another example to help us learn what makes a good experiment. \r\n[L10] It is common knowledge that smoking is a difficult habit to break. Studies have \r\n[L11] reported that regardless of what smokers do to quit, most relapse within a year. \r\n[L12] Some scientists have suggested that smokers are less likely to relapse if they take \r\n[L13] an antidepressant regularly after they quit. How can you design an experiment to \r\n[L14] study whether antidepressants help smokers to quit?\r\n[L15] For this type of study, as in most medical experiments, it is not feasible to ran\ufffedomly sample the population (all smokers who would like to quit) because they \r\n[L16] cannot be readily identified. We need to use a convenience sample. For instance, \r\n[L17] a medical center might advertise to attract volunteers from the smokers who \r\n[L18] would like to quit.\r\n[L19] Control comparison group Suppose you have 400 volunteers who would like to \r\n[L20] quit smoking. You could ask them to quit, starting today. You could have each start \r\n[L21] taking an antidepressant and then a year from now check how many have relapsed. \r\n[L22] Perhaps 42% of them would relapse. But this is not enough information.8\r\n[L23]  You need \r\n[L24] to be able to compare this result to the percentage who would relapse if they were \r\n[L25] not taking the antidepressant.\r\n[L26] 8\r\n[L27] Chapter 12 explains another reason a control group is needed. The regression effect implies that, \r\n[L28] over time, poor subjects tend to improve and good subjects tend to get worse, in relative terms.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 45>Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 199\r\n[L29] An experiment normally has a primary treatment of interest, such as receiving \r\n[L30] an antidepressant. But it should also have a second treatment for comparison to \r\n[L31] help you analyze the effectiveness of the primary treatment. So the volunteers \r\n[L32] should be split into two groups: One group receives the antidepressant, and the \r\n[L33] other group does not. You could give the second group a pill that looks like the \r\n[L34] antidepressant but that does not have any active ingredient\u2014a placebo. This \r\n[L35] second group, using the placebo treatment, is called the control group. After sub\ufffejects are assigned to the treatments and observed for a certain period of time, the \r\n[L36] relapse rates are compared. Because the only distinction between the groups, at \r\n[L37] least by design, is taking the antidepressant, the difference between the relapse \r\n[L38] rate of two groups is attributed to the treatment.\r\n[L39] Why bother to give the placebo to the control group if the pill doesn\u2019t contain \r\n[L40] any active ingredient? This is partly so that the two treatments appear identical \r\n[L41] to the subjects. (As we\u2019ll discuss, subjects should not know which treatment they \r\n[L42] are receiving.) This is also because people who take a placebo tend to respond \r\n[L43] better than those who receive nothing, perhaps for psychological reasons. This \r\n[L44] is called the placebo effect. For instance, of the subjects not receiving the an\ufffetidepressant, perhaps 75% would relapse within a year, but if they received a \r\n[L45] placebo pill perhaps 55% of them would relapse.\n# \u30104\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"13:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] If the \r\n[L2] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L3] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L4] still having an overall n = 40.

A \r\n[L23] stratified sample uses every stratum. By contrast, a cluster sample uses a sam\ufffeple of the clusters rather than all of them. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L24] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L25] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L26] random sample).\r\n[L27] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L28] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L29] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L30] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L31] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L32] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L33] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L34] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L35] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L36] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L37] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L38] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L39] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L40] be infeasible.\r\n[L41] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L42] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L43] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L44] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L45] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L46] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L47] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L48] sampling. Similar formulas exist for other types of random sampling, but they are \r\n[L49] complex and beyond the scope of this text.\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://ed89cdda53b20f2#file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19#p_27.jpg","size_bytes":47969,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null}],"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":13,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["slurm_github_commits","slurm_github_issues","slurm_github_pulls","recording_knowledge","files_uploaded_in_conversation","slurm_github"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"8bd17603-0d07-4481-b335-197397bc138b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"4d00eb24-10da-4dfb-9319-4075ed5c9f4b","turn_exchange_id":"31610262-4e8f-4a65-bc88-8f9d4b8c8239"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4d00eb24-10da-4dfb-9319-4075ed5c9f4b","children":["ef0dc724-4ec6-4f17-b039-c232749e1d8a"]},"ef0dc724-4ec6-4f17-b039-c232749e1d8a":{"id":"ef0dc724-4ec6-4f17-b039-c232749e1d8a","message":{"id":"ef0dc724-4ec6-4f17-b039-c232749e1d8a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766206452.764994,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Identifying omitted concepts in chapter","content":"The chapter covers a lot of ground on experimental designs, but might be missing things like systematic and quota sampling, randomization mechanics, and sample size/power details.

With simple random sampling, (i) every subject is equally \r\n[L18] likely to be chosen, and (ii) every possible sample of size \r\n[L19] n is equally likely.

Using these numbers, you would say the reduction in relapse was \r\n[L5] 33% (75% \u2212 42%) when comparing it to nothing, but 13% (55% \u2212 42%) when \r\n[L6] compared to the placebo group.\r\n[L7] In some experiments, a control group may receive an existing treatment rather \r\n[L8] than a placebo. For instance, a smoking cessation study might analyze whether \r\n[L9] an antidepressant works better than a nicotine patch in helping smokers to quit. \r\n[L10] It may be unethical not to provide the standard of care, in this case a nicotine \r\n[L11] patch, if it has already been shown in previous studies to be more effective than \r\n[L12] a placebo. Or the experiment could compare all three treatments: antidepressant, \r\n[L13] nicotine patch, and a placebo.\r\n[L14] Randomization In the smoking cessation experiment, how should the 400 study \r\n[L15] subjects be assigned to the treatment groups? Should you personally decide which \r\n[L16] treatment each subject receives? This could result in bias. If you are conducting \r\n[L17] the study to show that the antidepressant is effective, you might consciously or \r\n[L18] subconsciously place smokers you believe will be more likely to succeed into the \r\n[L19] group that receives the antidepressant.\r\n[L20] It is better to use randomization to assign the subjects: Randomly assign 200 of \r\n[L21] the 400 subjects to receive the antidepressant and the other 200 subjects to form the \r\n[L22] control group. Randomization helps to prevent bias from one treatment group tend\ufffeing to be different from the other in some way, such as having better health or being \r\n[L23] younger. In using randomization, we attempt to balance the treatment groups by \r\n[L24] making them similar with respect to their distribution on potential lurking variables. \r\n[L25] This enables us to attribute any difference in their relapse rates to the treatments \r\n[L26] they are using, not to lurking variables or to researcher bias.\r\n[L27] You might think you can do better than randomization by using your own \r\n[L28] judgment to assign subjects to the treatment groups. For instance, when you iden\ufffetify a potential lurking variable, you could try to balance the groups according \r\n[L29] to its values. If age is that variable, every time you put someone of a particular \r\n[L30] age in one treatment group, you could put someone of the same age in the other \r\n[L31] treatment group. There are two problems with this: (1) many variables are likely \r\n[L32] to be important, and it is difficult to balance groups on all of them at once, and \r\n[L33] (2) you may not have thought of other relevant lurking variables. Even if you can \r\n[L34] balance the groups on the variables you identified, the groups could be unbal\ufffeanced on these other variables, causing the overall results to be biased in favor of \r\n[L35] one treatment.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 45>200 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L36] You can feel more confident about the worthiness of new research findings if \r\n[L37] they come from a randomized experiment with a control group rather than from \r\n[L38] an experiment without a control group, from an experiment that did not use ran\ufffedomization to assign subjects to the treatments, or from an observational study. \r\n[L39] An analysis9\r\n[L40]  of published medical studies about treatments for heart attacks \r\n[L41] indicated that the new therapy provided improved treatment 58% of the time \r\n[L42] in studies without randomization and control groups but only 9% of the time in \r\n[L43] studies having randomization and control groups.

The investigators from the polling \r\n[L24] organization realize that it is not possible to find a reliable \r\n[L25] sampling frame of all fraternities. Using a list of all college \r\n[L26] institutions, they randomly sample 30 of them and then \r\n[L27] interview the officers of each fraternity at each of these \r\n[L28]  institutions that has fraternities.

Data also suggest \r\n[L36] that individuals who smoke marijuana are twice as likely \r\n[L37] to develop schizophrenia as those who do not use the drug. \r\n[L38] Contributing to the apparent relationship, a comprehen\ufffesive review done in 2007 of the existing research reported \r\n[L39] that individuals who merely try marijuana increase their \r\n[L40] risk of developing schizophrenia by 40%. Meanwhile, the \r\n[L41] percentage of the population who has tried marijuana \r\n[L42] has increased dramatically in the United States over the \r\n[L43] past 50 years, whereas the percentage of the population \r\n[L44] affected by schizophrenia has remained constant at about \r\n[L45] 1%.

Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L10] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L11] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L12] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L13] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L14] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L15] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L16] double-blind. That\u2019s ideal.\r\n[L17] Study design b Antidepressants for Quitting Smoking\r\n[L18] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L19] To investigate whether antidepressants help people quit smoking, one study10\r\n[L20] used 429 men and women who were 18 or older and had smoked 15 cigarettes \r\n[L21] or more per day for the previous year. The subjects were highly motivated to \r\n[L22] quit and in good health. They were assigned to one of two groups: One group \r\n[L23] took 300 mg daily of an antidepressant that has the brand name bupropion. \r\n[L24] The other group did not take an antidepressant. At the end of a year, the \r\n[L25] study observed whether each subject had successfully abstained from smok\ufffeing or had relapsed.\r\n[L26] Questions to Explore\r\n[L27] a. Identify the response and explanatory variables, the treatments, and the \r\n[L28] experimental units.\r\n[L29] Example 7 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 45>Section 4.3 Good and Poor Ways to Experiment 201\r\n[L30] Generalizing Results to Broader Populations\r\n[L31] We\u2019ve seen that random samples are preferable to convenience samples, yet con\ufffevenience samples are more feasible than many experiments. When an experiment \r\n[L32] uses a convenience sample, be cautious about the extent to which results gener\ufffealize to a larger population. Look carefully at the characteristics of the sample. \r\n[L33] Do they seem representative of the overall population? If not, the results have \r\n[L34] dubious worth.\r\n[L35] b. How should the researchers assign the subjects to the two treatment \r\n[L36] groups?\r\n[L37] c. Without knowing more about this study, what would you identify as a \r\n[L38] potential problem with the study design?\r\n[L39] Think It Through\r\n[L40] a. This experiment has\r\n[L41] Response variable: Whether the subject abstains from smoking for \r\n[L42] one year (yes or no)\r\n[L43] Explanatory variable: Whether the subject received bupropion (yes \r\n[L44] or no)\r\n[L45] Treatments: bupropion, no bupropion\r\n[L46] Experimental units: The 429 volunteers who are the study subjects\r\n[L47] b. The researchers should randomize to assign subjects to the two treat\ufffements. They could use random numbers to randomly assign half (215) \r\n[L48] of the subjects to form the group that uses bupropion and 214 subjects \r\n[L49] to the group that does not receive bupropion (the control group).

This suggests that studies con\ufffeducted without randomization or without other ways to reduce bias may produce \r\n[L20] results that tend to be overly optimistic.\r\n[L21] 9\r\n[L22] See Crossen (1994), p. 168.\r\n[L23] 10Annals of Internal Medicine 2001; 135:423\u2013433.\r\n[L24] SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\r\n[L25] Use randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments\r\n[L26] j To eliminate bias that may result if you (the researchers) assign the subjects\r\n[L27] j To balance the groups on variables that you know affect the response\r\n[L28] j To balance the groups on lurking variables that may be unknown to you\r\n[L29] Blinding the study It is important that the treatment groups be treated as \r\n[L30] equally as possible. Ideally, the subjects are blind to the treatment to which \r\n[L31] they are assigned. In the smoking cessation study, the subjects should not know \r\n[L32] whether they are taking the antidepressant or a placebo. Whoever has contact \r\n[L33] with the subjects during the experiment, including the data collectors who record \r\n[L34] the subjects\u2019 response outcomes, should also be blind to the treatment informa\ufffetion. Otherwise they could intentionally or unintentionally provide extra sup\ufffeport to one group or make different decisions for subjects, depending on which \r\n[L35] treatment they received, including whether they have relapsed. (Does just one \r\n[L36] cigarette count? What about two? etc.) When neither the subject nor those hav\ufffeing contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called \r\n[L37] double-blind.

Facebook users were \r\n[L16] randomly selected to be part of two parallel studies in \r\n[L17] which Facebook manipulated the exposure to emo\ufffetional expressions in the user\u2019s news feed. Two parallel \r\n[L18]  experiments were conducted. In one study, it reduced \r\n[L19] the positive emotional content; in the other study, the \r\n[L20] negative emotional content was reduced. For\u00a0each \r\n[L21] study, there was a control group (the users\u2019 news feed \r\n[L22] was not manipulated), and an experimental group (the \r\n[L23] users\u2019 news\u00a0feed was manipulated\u2014either positively or \r\n[L24] negatively). Two variables were measured in each study \r\n[L25] after the manipulation by Facebook: the percentage of \r\n[L26] all words produced by a person that was positive and \r\n[L27] the percentage of all words produced by a person that \r\n[L28] was negative.

A total sample of 977 participants \r\n[L46] from 28 experimental studies was considered in the investi\ufffegation. Results show that typing and reading text messages \r\n[L47] while driving adversely affected driver control ability. Typing \r\n[L48] text messages alone produced similar decrements as typing \r\n[L49] and reading, whereas reading alone had smaller decrements \r\n[L50] over fewer dependent variables.

When an experiment \r\n[L32] uses a convenience sample, be cautious about the extent to which results gener\ufffealize to a larger population.

The plan is to use the student directory to take a simple random sample of \r\n[L22] n = 40 students and analyze how the mean compares for freshmen, sophomores, \r\n[L23] juniors, and seniors. Merely by chance, you may get only a few observations from \r\n[L24] one of the classes, making it hard to estimate the mean well for that class. If the \r\n[L25] student directory also identifies students by their class, you could amend the \r\n[L26] sampling scheme to take a simple random sample of 10 students from each class, \r\n[L27] still having an overall n = 40. The four classes are called strata of the population. \r\n[L28] This type of sample is called a stratified random sample.\r\n[L29] Stratified Random Sample\r\n[L30] A stratified random sample divides the population into separate groups, called strata, \r\n[L31] based on some attribute or characteristic about the subjects, and then selects a simple \r\n[L32] random sample from each stratum.\r\n[L33] Stratified sampling is particularly useful when the typical values of the re\ufffesponse variable differ substantially across the strata. A limitation of stratifica\ufffetion is that you must have a sampling frame and know the stratum into which \r\n[L34] each subject in the sampling frame belongs. You might want to stratify students \r\n[L35] in your school by whether the student has a job, to make sure you get enough \r\n[L36] students who work and who don\u2019t work.

Figure 4.2 illustrates the distinction \r\n[L24] among sampling subjects (simple random sample), sampling clusters of subjects \r\n[L25] (cluster random sample), and sampling subjects from within strata (stratified \r\n[L26] random sample).\r\n[L27] In addition, a cluster sample uses predetermined groups to create a single sam\ufffepling frame, whereas a stratified sample creates multiple sampling frames by strata \r\n[L28] based on a subject characteristic. In the previous examples, city blocks already exist \r\n[L29] and can be listed as the sampling frame. The sampling frames for class year have to \r\n[L30] be defined separately before random selection is performed.\r\n[L31] Comparison of different random sampling methods A good sampling design \r\n[L32] ensures that each subject in a population has an opportunity to be selected. The \r\n[L33] design should incorporate randomness. Table 4.1 summarizes the random sampling \r\n[L34] methods we\u2019ve presented.\r\n[L35] In practice, sampling designs often have two or more stages. When carrying \r\n[L36] out a large survey for predicting national elections, the Gallup organization often \r\n[L37] (1) identifies election districts as clusters and takes a simple random sample of <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 28 / 45>206 Chapter 4 Gathering Data\r\n[L38] them, and (2) takes a simple random sample of households within each selected \r\n[L39] election district rather than sampling every household in a district, which might \r\n[L40] be infeasible.\r\n[L41] Marketing companies also commonly use two-stage cluster sampling, first \r\n[L42] randomly selecting test market cities (the clusters) and then randomly selecting \r\n[L43] consumers within each test market city. Many major surveys, such as the General \r\n[L44] Social Survey, Gallup polls, and the Current Population Survey, incorporate both \r\n[L45] stratification and clustering.\r\n[L46] In future chapters, when we use the term random sampling, we\u2019ll mean simple \r\n[L47] random sampling. The formulas for most statistical methods assume simple random \r\n[L48] sampling. Similar formulas exist for other types of random sampling, but they are \r\n[L49] complex and beyond the scope of this text.\n# \u30102\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"16:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Poor Ways to Sample\r\n[L2] How the sample is obtained can also result in bias. Two sampling methods that may \r\n[L3] be necessary but are not ideal are a convenience sample and a volunteer sample.\r\n[L4] Convenience samples Have you ever been stopped on the street or at a shop\ufffeping mall to participate in a survey? Such a survey is likely not a random sample \r\n[L5] but rather a convenience sample. It is easy for the interviewer to obtain data \r\n[L6] relatively cheaply. But the sample may poorly represent the population. Biases \r\n[L7] may result because of the time and location of the interview and the judgment \r\n[L8] of the interviewer about whom to interview. For example, working people might \r\n[L9] be underrepresented if the interviews are conducted on workdays between 9\u00a0a.m. \r\n[L10] and 5 p.m. Poor people may be underrepresented if the interviewer conducts \r\n[L11] interviews at an upscale shopping mall. Homosexuals might not be selected in a \r\n[L12] study about romantic relationships if the interviewer is homophobic.\r\n[L13] Volunteer samples Have you ever answered a survey you\u2019ve seen posted on \r\n[L14] the Internet, such as at the home page for a news organization? A sample of this \r\n[L15] type, called a volunteer sample, is the most common type of convenience sample. \r\n[L16] As the name implies, subjects volunteer to be in the sample. One segment of the \r\n[L17] population may be more likely to volunteer than other segments because they \r\n[L18] have stronger opinions about the issue or are more likely to visit that Internet \r\n[L19] site. This results in sampling bias. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research \r\n[L20] Center (January 6, 2003) estimated that 46% of Republicans said they like to \r\n[L21] register their opinions in online surveys, compared with only 28% of Democrats. \r\n[L22] (Why? One possible lurking variable is time spent on the Internet. Perhaps \r\n[L23] Republicans spend more time on the Internet than Democrats do.) Thus, results \r\n[L24] of online surveys may be more weighted in the direction of Republicans\u2019 beliefs \r\n[L25] than the general population.\r\n[L26] Convenience samples are not ideal. Sometimes, however, they are necessary, \r\n[L27] both in observational studies and in experiments. This is often true in medical \r\n[L28] studies. Suppose we want to investigate how well a new drug performs compared \r\n[L29] to a standard drug for subjects who suffer from high blood pressure. We won\u2019t \r\n[L30] find a sampling frame of all who suffer from high blood pressure and take a sim\ufffeple random sample of them. We may, however, be able to sample such subjects at \r\n[L31] medical centers or by using volunteers. Even then, randomization should be used \r\n[L32] wherever possible. For the study patients, we can randomly select who is given \r\n[L33] the new drug and who is given the standard one.\r\n[L34] Some samples are poor not only because of their convenience but also be\ufffecause they use a sampling frame that does not reflect the population. An exam\ufffeple of this was a poll in 1936 to predict the result of a presidential election.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 45>Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 195\r\n[L35] A poor sample b The Literary Digest Poll\r\n[L36] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L37] The Literary Digest magazine conducted a poll to predict the result of the 1936 \r\n[L38] presidential election between Franklin Roosevelt (Democrat and incumbent) \r\n[L39] and Alf Landon (Republican). At the time, the magazine\u2019s polls were famous \r\n[L40] because they had correctly predicted three successive elections. In 1936, \r\n[L41] Literary Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people and asked how they \r\n[L42] planned to vote. The sampling frame was constructed from telephone directo\uffferies, country club memberships, and automobile registrations. Approximately \r\n[L43] 2.3 million people returned the questionnaire.\n# \u30103\u2020Design_of_experiments.pdf\u2020file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Design_of_experiments.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"16:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Sampling Frame and Sampling Design\r\n[L2] Once you\u2019ve identified the population, the second step is to compile a list of sub\ufffejects so you can sample from it. This list is called the sampling frame.\r\n[L3] Sampling Frame\r\n[L4] The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is \r\n[L5] taken.\r\n[L6] Ideally, the sampling frame lists the entire population of interest. In practice, \r\n[L7] as in a census, it\u2019s usually hard to identify every subject in the population.\r\n[L8] Suppose you plan to sample students at your school, asking students to com\ufffeplete a questionnaire about various issues. The population is all students at the \r\n[L9] school. One possible sampling frame is the student directory. Another one is a list \r\n[L10] of registered students.\r\n[L11] Once you have a sampling frame, you need to specify a method for selecting \r\n[L12] subjects from it. The method used is called the sampling design. Here\u2019s one possi\ufffeble sampling design for sampling students at your school: You select all students \r\n[L13] in your statistics class. Do you think your class is necessarily reflective of the \r\n[L14] entire student body? Do you have a representative mixture of freshmen through \r\n[L15] seniors, males and females, athletes and nonathletes, working and nonworking \r\n[L16] students, political party affiliations, and so on? With this sampling design, it\u2019s \r\n[L17] doubtful.\r\n[L18] When you pick a sample merely by convenience, the results may not be rep\uffferesentative of the population. Some response outcomes may occur much more \r\n[L19] frequently than in the population, and some may occur much less. Consider a \r\n[L20] survey question about the number of hours a week that you work at an outside \r\n[L21] job. If your class is primarily juniors and seniors, they may be more likely to work \r\n[L22] than freshmen or sophomores. The mean response in the sample may be much \r\n[L23] larger than in the overall student population. Information from the sample may \r\n[L24] be misleading.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 45>Section 4.2 Good and Poor Ways to Sample 189\r\n[L25] Simple Random Sampling\r\n[L26] You\u2019re more likely to obtain a representative sample if you let chance, rather than \r\n[L27] convenience, determine the sample. The sampling design should give each student \r\n[L28] an equal chance to be in the sample. It should also enable the data analyst to figure \r\n[L29] out how likely it is that descriptive statistics (such as sample means) fall close to \r\n[L30] corresponding values you\u2019d like to make inferences about for the entire popula\ufffetion (such as population means). These are reasons for using random sampling.\r\n[L31] You may have been part of a selection process in which your name was put in \r\n[L32] a box or hat along with many other names, and someone blindly picked a name \r\n[L33] for a prize. If the names were thoroughly mixed before the selection, this emu\ufffelates a random type of sampling called a simple random sample. \r\n[L34] Simple Random Sample\r\n[L35] A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible \r\n[L36] sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\r\n[L37] 5HFDOO\r\n[L38] As in Chapters 2 and 3, n denotes the \r\n[L39] number of observations in the sample, \r\n[L40] called the sample size. b\r\n[L41] A simple random sample is often just called a random sample. The \u201csimple\u201d \r\n[L42] adjective distinguishes this type of sampling from more complex random sampling \r\n[L43] designs presented in Section 4.4.\r\n[L44] Simple random \r\n[L45] samples b Drawing Prize Winners\r\n[L46] Picture the Scenario\r\n[L47] A campus club decides to raise money for a local charity by selling tickets to \r\n[L48] a dinner banquet and raffle.

The U.S. Bureau of the Census uses capture\u2013recapture \r\n[L39] to make adjustments to the census by estimating the \r\n[L40] undercount. The capture phase is the census itself \r\n[L41] (persons are \u201ctagged\u201d by having returned their census \r\n[L42] form and being recorded as counted), and the recap\ufffeture phase (the second sample) is the postenumerative \r\n[L43] survey (PES) conducted after the census. Label the \r\n[L44] table in terms of the census application.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 45 / 45>Chapter Problems 223\r\n[L45] Student Activities\r\n[L46] 4.108 Munchie capture\u2013recapture Your class can use the \r\n[L47]  capture\u2013recapture method described in the previous \r\n[L48] exercise to estimate the number of goldfish in a bag \r\n[L49] of Cheddar Goldfish. Pour the Cheddar Goldfish into \r\n[L50] a paper bag, which represents the pond. Sample 10 of \r\n[L51] them. For this initial sample, use Pretzel Goldfish to \r\n[L52] replace them, to represent the tagged fish. Then select a \r\n[L53] second sample and derive an estimate for N, the number \r\n[L54] of Cheddar Goldfish in the original bag. See how close \r\n[L55] your estimate comes to the actual number of fish in the \r\n[L56] bag. (Your teacher will count the population of Cheddar \r\n[L57] Goldfish in the bag before beginning the sampling.) If the \r\n[L58] estimate is not close, what could be responsible, and what \r\n[L59] would this reflect as difficulties in a real-life application \r\n[L60] such as sampling a wildlife population?\r\n[L61] 4.109 Activity: Sampling the states This activity illustrates \r\n[L62] how sampling bias can result when you use a nonrandom \r\n[L63] sample, even if you attempt to make it representative: \r\n[L64] You are in a geography class, discussing center and \r\n[L65] variability for several characteristics of the states in the \r\n[L66] contiguous United States.

Here are major ideas you\u2019d typically expect in a fuller design-of-experiments treatment:\n\n### A. Planning the question precisely\n- **Estimand / target effect definition:** *What* causal quantity are you trying to estimate (average treatment effect? effect in compliers? effect at 6 months vs 1 year)?  \n  *Why it matters:* different estimands imply different designs and analyses.\n- **Primary vs secondary endpoints (outcomes):** pick one primary outcome to avoid \u201cfishing\u201d and inflated false positives.\n- **Effect size planning:** define what effect size is practically meaningful before collecting data.\n\n### B. Sample size and power planning\n- **Power and sample-size calculations:** choosing \\(n\\) to achieve a desired probability of detecting an effect (power) at a chosen false-positive risk (Type I error rate).  \n  *Why it matters:* underpowered experiments produce noisy, non-replicable results; overpowering wastes resources/ethics.\n\n### C. Randomization *mechanics* beyond \u201cflip a coin\u201d\nThe chapter motivates randomization \ue200filecite\ue202turn15file0\ue202L24-L28\ue201 but doesn\u2019t get into common real-world schemes:\n- **Blocked randomization (allocation in blocks):** ensures near-balance in group sizes throughout recruitment.\n- **Stratified randomization:** randomize within strata (e.g., hospital, sex, baseline severity) to improve balance on key prognostic variables.\n- **Allocation concealment:** preventing the recruiter from knowing the next assignment (distinct from blinding).  \n  *Why it matters:* without concealment, selection bias can creep in even if \u201crandomization\u201d is nominally used.\n\n### D. Practical threats to internal validity\n- **Noncompliance / protocol deviations:** subjects don\u2019t follow assigned treatment.\n- **Missing outcomes / attrition:** dropouts differ systematically by treatment arm.\n- **Contamination / spillover:** control group gets partial exposure to treatment (common in education/behavioral interventions).\n- **Carryover effects in crossover trials:** the first treatment affects outcomes under the second (the text mentions carryover risk only briefly) \ue200filecite\ue202turn15file0\ue202L2018-L2022\ue201.\n\n### E. Analysis methods tied to designs (usually postponed to later chapters)\n- **Analysis of variance (ANOVA)** (analysis of variance) / linear models for randomized designs.\n- **Factorial-effect estimation + interactions:** not just \u201ctwo factors exist,\u201d but whether the effect of A depends on B (interaction). The text uses 2-factor layouts \ue200filecite\ue202turn13file0\ue202L27-L32\ue201 but doesn\u2019t develop the interaction concept formally.\n- **Multiple comparisons control:** if you compare many treatments/endpoints, you need procedures to avoid many false positives (e.g., family-wise error rate control).\n\n### F. Classic and industrial design families\nTypically absent from intro \u201cgathering data\u201d chapters:\n- **Fractional factorial designs:** efficient screening when many factors exist (with aliasing/confounding of effects).\n- **Response surface methodology (RSM)** (response surface methodology): sequential designs for optimizing a quantitative response (central composite, Box\u2013Behnken).\n- **Split-plot and nested designs:** when randomization is constrained (whole-plot vs subplot factors).\n- **Latin square / balanced incomplete block designs:** structured blocking when multiple nuisance sources exist.\n\n### G. Ethical and reporting infrastructure (esp. in medicine)\n- **Pre-registration and protocols**, stopping rules, interim analyses, Data Monitoring Committees.\n- **CONSORT** (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) reporting norms.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Sampling methods in more detail (definitions + pros/cons)\n\nA key meta-point the chapter itself makes: most \u201cstandard formulas\u201d assume **simple random sampling**, and other designs require more complex handling \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file1\ue202L46-L49\ue201.\n\n### 2.1 Simple random sampling (SRS)\n\n**Definition (core):** a simple random sample of size \\(n\\) is one where **each possible sample of size \\(n\\)** has the **same chance** of selection \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file3\ue202L34-L36\ue201.\n\n**How it\u2019s done:** label the sampling frame, then use random numbers to pick \\(n\\) distinct units.\n\n**Advantages**\n- **Clean probability basis** \u2192 unbiased estimation is straightforward; standard errors/margins-of-error are simplest.\n- **Minimizes selection bias** (if the sampling frame is good and response rates are decent).\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- Requires a **complete sampling frame** (often unrealistic).\n- Can be **logistically expensive** (units may be geographically dispersed).\n- Still vulnerable to **nonresponse** and **measurement/response bias** (random selection doesn\u2019t force truthful answers).\n\n**Example:** From a registry of 50,000 patients with hypertension, randomly draw 800 patient IDs to survey.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Systematic sampling\n\n**Definition (typical):** choose a random start, then take every \\(k\\)-th unit from an ordered list. The text\u2019s example: pick one of the first 100 at random, then skip 100 each time \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file4\ue202L12-L16\ue201.\n\n**Advantages**\n- **Very easy to implement** (especially in the field).\n- Can give **good coverage (\u201cspread\u201d)** across the list, often better than a haphazard SRS implementation when logistics matter.\n- Often cheaper and faster than SRS.\n\n**Disadvantages (important)**\n- **Periodicity risk:** if the list has a pattern aligned with \\(k\\), the sample can be badly biased.  \n  (E.g., if a production line cycles \u201cgood, good, bad\u201d every 3 items and you sample every 3rd item, you might over-sample defects.)\n- It is **not** an SRS in general: even if every unit has equal selection probability, not every size-\\(n\\) subset is equally likely (the exercise in the text explicitly probes this) \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file4\ue202L17-L20\ue201.\n- Variance estimation can be trickier unless you treat it approximately as SRS under \u201crandom order\u201d assumptions.\n\n**Example:** At a clinic with a daily patient list, pick a random start among the first 10 arrivals, then survey every 10th arrival.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Stratified sampling (stratified random sample)\n\n**Definition:** divide the population into **strata** (subgroups) and take a **simple random sample within each stratum** \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file0\ue202L29-L33\ue201.\n\n**When it\u2019s especially good:** when typical outcome values differ across strata, or when you need reliable subgroup estimates \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file0\ue202L33-L37\ue201.\n\n**Advantages**\n- **Ensures representation** of key subgroups (you can guarantee enough observations per group) \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file0\ue202L40-L43\ue201.\n- Often **increases precision** vs SRS at the same cost if strata are internally homogeneous.\n- Enables explicit comparisons across groups (e.g., age bands, regions).\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- You must have a sampling frame that includes **stratum membership** for each unit \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file0\ue202L33-L37\ue201.\n- More complex logistics (multiple draws, weighting if strata sampling fractions differ).\n- Poorly chosen strata can waste effort (stratifying on irrelevant attributes gives little gain).\n\n**Example:** In a vaccine attitude survey, stratify by age group (18\u201329, 30\u201349, 50+) and sample randomly within each to ensure enough older respondents.\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Quota sampling (non-probability)\n\n**Definition (as described in the text):** an interviewer samples people until reaching **quotas** that match population proportions (e.g., 50 factory workers, 100 housewives, \u2026) \ue200filecite\ue202turn14file3\ue202L50-L56\ue201.\n\n**Key point:** **Not** a random sampling method in general \ue200filecite\ue202turn14file3\ue202L56-L57\ue201 because selection within each quota is typically by convenience/judgment.\n\n**Advantages**\n- Fast and cheap; often feasible when you lack a good sampling frame.\n- Guarantees the sample matches the population on the **quota variables** (e.g., sex/age categories), which can look \u201crepresentative\u201d on those dimensions.\n\n**Disadvantages (the big ones)**\n- **Unknown selection probabilities** \u2192 you generally **cannot** justify standard margins-of-error or unbiasedness claims.\n- **Selection bias within quotas:** interviewers choose \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201capproachable\u201d people; unmeasured variables (education, health, time availability) can be distorted.\n- Matching population proportions on a few variables does **not** fix bias on other variables (often the ones that matter).\n\n**Example:** A street interviewer fills quotas to match city demographics by age and sex, but ends up over-sampling people who are outdoors mid-day (retirees, tourists, unemployed).\n\n---\n\n### 2.5 Convenience sampling (non-probability)\n\n**Definition + critique in text:** a convenience sample is easy/cheap to obtain but may poorly represent the population; time/location/interviewer judgment can create bias \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file2\ue202L4-L12\ue201.\n\n**Advantages**\n- Often the only feasible approach (especially for early-stage studies, pilots, rare populations).\n- Cheap and fast; good for **exploratory** work (hypothesis generation, instrument testing).\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- Typically **biased / not representative** (sometimes severely).\n- Generalization to a target population is often weak or unjustified.\n- Results can be misleadingly \u201cprecise\u201d if people treat the convenience sample like a probability sample.\n\nThe text also notes convenience samples are common/necessary in medical studies, but stresses you should still randomize treatment assignment within the available sample whenever possible \ue200filecite\ue202turn16file2\ue202L26-L33\ue201.\n\n**Example:** Recruiting the first 200 patients who show up at a single hospital\u2019s outpatient clinic to estimate prevalence of a condition in the entire city.\n\n---\n\n### A blunt rule of thumb\n- If you need **population-level inference with defensible uncertainty**, prioritize **probability sampling** (SRS/stratified/systematic-with-care).  \n- If you\u2019re doing **exploration or pilot work**, convenience/quota can be acceptable\u2014but you should treat conclusions as *tentative* and avoid overclaiming.\n\nIf you tell me the context you care about (e.g., education experiments, clinical trials, industrial processes), I can suggest which of the \u201comitted\u201d design topics are the highest ROI to learn next."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":215,"end_ix":245,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Design_of_experiments.pdf","id":"file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19","source":"my_files","text":"SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\nUse randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments","extra":{"retrieval_turn":15,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":87,"cited_message_id":"22b7f0e9-29cf-487b-ab70-488e0f5beba1","search_result_idx":0,"line_range":[24,37],"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":1327,"end_ix":1357,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Design_of_experiments.pdf","id":"file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19","source":"my_files","text":"SUMMARY: The Role of Randomization in Experiments\nUse randomization for assigning subjects to the treatments","extra":{"retrieval_turn":15,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":87,"cited_message_id":"22b7f0e9-29cf-487b-ab70-488e0f5beba1","search_result_idx":0,"line_range":[24,28],"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":2385,"end_ix":2419,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Design_of_experiments.pdf","id":"file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":15,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":87,"cited_message_id":"22b7f0e9-29cf-487b-ab70-488e0f5beba1","search_result_idx":0,"line_range":[2018,2022],"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":2765,"end_ix":2795,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Design_of_experiments.pdf","id":"file_000000004ca072088b36617a39658e19","source":"my_files","text":"m Figure 4.4 Diagram of a Randomized Experiment with Two Factors (Whether \nUse Bupropion and Whether Use a Nicotine Patch).

Under that broader umbrella, equal inclusion \\(\\pi_i\\) is one *special* property, but not the definition.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended precise terminology (to avoid ambiguity)\n\n- **Probability sample / probability sampling:** selection by a known chance mechanism (a distribution \\(p(S)\\) is specified).  \n- **Simple random sample (SRSWOR):** fixed \\(|S|=n\\) and **every \\(n\\)-subset equally likely** (definition 2).  \n- **Equal-inclusion-probability design (EPSEM / self-weighting):** **\\(\\pi_i\\) equal for all \\(i\\)** (definition 1).  \n- **Systematic / stratified / cluster sampling:** other probability designs; may or may not be EPSEM; generally not SRS.\n\n---\n\n### Why the distinction matters (one sentence)\nEqual inclusion probabilities mostly determine **unbiasedness/weights**, while equal subset probabilities (SRS) gives you a particularly simple **joint structure** and variance formulas; confusing them leads to incorrect uncertainty quantification.\n\nIf you want, I can also phrase the distinction in the \u201ci.i.d. random sample\u201d language (common in probability theory), which is yet a third meaning of \u201crandom sample\u201d and can further confuse things if not stated explicitly."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"e6734c10-b330-46c5-9efa-dc54c5e922b8","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c4df483f-c0f5-4af0-881c-bcd04b2bced0","turn_exchange_id":"c0cbd568-4bfa-4a36-a1a1-f76ce60ab820"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"c4df483f-c0f5-4af0-881c-bcd04b2bced0","children":["6c02fffd-c2d7-4e80-adde-3e5a9c872b34"]},"6c02fffd-c2d7-4e80-adde-3e5a9c872b34":{"id":"6c02fffd-c2d7-4e80-adde-3e5a9c872b34","message":{"id":"6c02fffd-c2d7-4e80-adde-3e5a9c872b34","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766206913.801,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["To be clear, systematic sampling, stratified sampling --> for each of these methods, is (1) or (2) or neither satisfied?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"352d1916-679c-450a-8d70-9b8b136bb7c7","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"804e7567-5aff-4c0d-b0d3-99675faf2b45"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c79346cf-1540-4cf0-9ef1-8103500334c7","children":["b3253729-0806-4a0b-9186-704fb67a862e"]},"b3253729-0806-4a0b-9186-704fb67a862e":{"id":"b3253729-0806-4a0b-9186-704fb67a862e","message":{"id":"b3253729-0806-4a0b-9186-704fb67a862e","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766206915.1767285,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"352d1916-679c-450a-8d70-9b8b136bb7c7","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"6c02fffd-c2d7-4e80-adde-3e5a9c872b34","turn_exchange_id":"804e7567-5aff-4c0d-b0d3-99675faf2b45","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6c02fffd-c2d7-4e80-adde-3e5a9c872b34","children":["e454437b-5d09-429f-99b9-5456a31d4fd5"]},"e454437b-5d09-429f-99b9-5456a31d4fd5":{"id":"e454437b-5d09-429f-99b9-5456a31d4fd5","message":{"id":"e454437b-5d09-429f-99b9-5456a31d4fd5","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766206915.862198,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing systematic and stratified sampling conditions","content":"For systematic sampling with a random start and fixed step, the inclusion probabilities are equal (1), but condition (2) isn't satisfied because only k possible samples exist.

Wong aimed to strengthen his mandate beyond the PAP's 60.1% popular vote share in 2020, one of its weakest showings.

\u201ceffective\u201d \\(n_{\\text{eff}}\\) via\n  \\[\n  \\text{MOE} \\approx 1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{0.25}{n_{\\text{eff}}}}\n  \\]\n- Set MOE = 0.04 \u21d2 \\(n_{\\text{eff}}\\approx 600\\).\n\nThat kind of calculation is consistent with a public-facing \u201crule\u201d like \u201c95% \u00b14%,\u201d even when the actual number of polling stations (and hence total sampled ballots \\(100H\\)) varies by constituency.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also work through a *numerical toy example* (e.g., 10 polling stations with different turnouts) to show exactly how the weighting and the

a concrete **toy constituency** that mimics the \u201c100 ballots per polling station, then weight by turnout\u201d idea.\n\nAssume there are **2 parties** (A vs B) and we ignore rejected votes for simplicity (so A% + B% = 100%).\n\n---\n\n## Step 0 \u2014 Set up the constituency\n\nThere are **6 polling stations** in the constituency.\n\n- \\(N_h\\) = number of **valid local votes** cast at station \\(h\\)  \n- They do a sample count of **\\(n_h=100\\)** ballots at each station  \n- \\(x_h\\) = number of sampled ballots for **Party A** at station \\(h\\)\n\n### Data\n\n| Station \\(h\\) | \\(N_h\\) (valid votes) | sample \\(n_h\\) | \\(x_h\\) (A votes in sample) | \\(\\hat p_h=x_h/100\\) |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| 1 | 900  | 100 | 52 | 0.52 |\n| 2 | 1200 | 100 | 58 | 0.58 |\n| 3

Weight each station by its share of votes\n\nWeight\n\\[\nW_h=\\frac{N_h}{N}.\n\\]\n\nSo the weights are:\n\n- \\(W_1=900/6000=0.15\\)\n- \\(W_2=1200/6000=0.20\\)\n- \\(W_3=600/6000=0.10\\)\n- \\(W_4=1500/6000=0.25\\)\n- \\(W_5=800/6000\\approx0.1333\\)\n- \\(W_6=1000/6000\\approx0.1667\\)\n\n---\n\n## Step 2 \u2014 Compute the constituency sample-count estimate (weighted)\n\nUse the stratified weighted estimator:\n\\[\n\\hat p=\\sum_{h=1}^6 W_h\\hat p_h.\n\\]\n\nCompute contributions \\(W_h\\hat p_h\\):\n\n- 1: \\(0.15\\times0.52=0.0780\\)\n- 2: \\(0.20\\times0.58=0.1160\\)\n- 3: \\(0.10\\times0.45=0.0450\\)\n- 4: \\(0.25\\times0.61=0.1525\\)\n- 5: \\(0.1333\\times0.50=0.0667\\)\n- 6: \\(0.1667\\times0.55=0.0917\\)\n\nSum:\n\\[\n\\hat p = 0.0780+0.1160+0.0450+0.1525+0.0667+0.0917\n=0.5498.\n\\]\n\n**Sample count estimate:** Party A \u2248 **54.98%** (say **55.0%**).\n\n---\n\n## Step 3 \u2014 Compute a likely standard error and 95% confidence interval\n\nWithin each station, the sample of 100 is (conceptually) **SRSWOR** (simple random sample without replacement), so a common plug-in variance for a proportion is:\n\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat p_h)\\approx\\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{\\hat p_h(1-\\hat p_h)}{n_h-1}.\n\\]\n\nThen for the weighted total:\n\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat p)=\\sum_{h=1}^6 W_h^2\\,\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat p_h),\n\\qquad\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat p)=\\sqrt{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat p)}.\n\\]\n\nCarrying out that calculation with the numbers above gives:\n\n- \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat p)\\approx 0.0004034\\)\n- \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat p)\\approx 0.02009\\)\n\nA standard \u201c95% confidence interval\u201d uses the normal approximation:\n\\[\n\\hat p \\pm 1.96\\,\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat p).\n\\]\n\nMargin of error:\n\\[\n1.96\\times 0.02009 \\approx 0.0394 \\quad (\\text{about } 3.94\\%).\n\\]\n\nSo the 95% CI is:\n\\[\n0.5498 \\pm 0.0394\n= [0.5105,\\;0.5892].\n\\]\n\n**Interpreted:** Party A \u2248 **55.0%**, with a likely **95% CI \u2248 51.0% to 58.9%** (\u2248 **\u00b14%**).\n\n---\n\n## Step 4 \u2014 Why weighting matters (what goes wrong if you \u201cjust pool the 600 ballots\u201d)\n\nTotal sampled ballots = \\(6\\times100=600\\).  \nTotal A ballots in sample = \\(52+58+45+61+50+55=321\\).\n\nNaive pooled estimate (treating it like one simple random sample of 600 ballots):\n\\[\n\\tilde p = 321/600 = 0.535 = 53.5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThat differs from the weighted estimate (55.0%) because **the design sampled equal counts from stations of unequal size**, which **over-represents smaller stations** and **under-represents larger stations** unless you weight.\n\nSo:\n- **Unweighted pooled** estimate answers: \u201cWhat is the average A-share across polling stations (each station weighted equally)?\u201d\n- **Weighted** estimate answers: \u201cWhat is the A-share across ballots in the constituency (each voter weighted equally)?\u201d\n\nThe weighted one is the constituency target.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also run the same example for **3 parties** (multinomial case) and show how you\u2019d compute separate intervals (or a joint approach) for each party\u2019s share."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"

On TV/ELD releases you usually see **only the point estimate**\nMost people mentally read \u201c55%\u201d as \u201cabout 55%, maybe off by ~1%\u201d, because in many elections the sample count ends up very close to the final count. But a 95% interval is **not trying to describe the typical error**\u2014it\u2019s trying to cover a wide range so that only about 1 in 20 times the true value falls outside.\n\nIf the standard error is ~2%, then:\n- **typical** absolute error is around 1\u20132 percentage points,\n- while a **95% band** is roughly \\(\\pm 2\\times\\) that, i.e. \\(\\pm 4\\) points.\n\nSo the interval looks \u201ctoo wide\u201d if you compare it to the *usual realised difference* between sample and final.\n\n#### B. My toy constituency was **tiny in \u201cnumber of polling stations\u201d**\nThe sample count procedure is \u201c**100 ballots per polling station**, then weighted and aggregated.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \nMy toy had **6 polling stations**, so total sampled ballots = \\(6\\times 100 = 600\\).\n\nA back-of-envelope binomial-style margin of error is\n\\[\n\\text{MOE}_{95} \\approx 1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n_{\\text{eff}}}}\n\\le 1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{0.25}{n_{\\text{eff}}}}.\n\\]\nSetting MOE = 0.04 gives \\(n_{\\text{eff}}\\approx 600\\). That\u2019s exactly the toy scale.\n\nIn reality, constituencies usually have **more** polling stations, so the total sample can be ~1,000 (SMC) or a few thousand (GRC), which tends to produce narrower MOE. A Business Times write-up (GE2015) notes typical sample sizes are around **~1,000 for SMCs and a few thousand for GRCs**, and that larger samples tend to be more accurate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\nNumerically (worst-ish case \\(p\\approx 0.55\\)):\n\n- \\(n=600\\): MOE \\(\\approx\\) **\u00b14.0%**\n- \\(n=1000\\): MOE \\(\\approx\\) **\u00b13.1%**\n- \\(n=3000\\): MOE \\(\\approx\\) **\u00b11.8%**\n\nSo if you\u2019re informally thinking of a GRC-sized sample count (thousands of ballots), my toy SMC-ish \\(n=600\\) interval will indeed look wider.\n\n#### C. The government may be quoting **one conservative \u201crule\u201d (\u00b14%)** for simplicity\nEven if a particular constituency\u2019s effective sample size implies a tighter interval, it\u2019s plausible they still publicise a uniform \u201c95% \u00b14%\u201d because it is:\n- easy to communicate,\n- conservative across constituencies (especially the smallest ones),\n- conservative across vote shares (widest uncertainty near 50\u201350),\n- and robust to real-world \u201cnon-idealities\u201d (e.g., imperfect random mixing in a \u201crandom stack of 100\u201d, counting noise).\n\nThe Straits Times infographic explicitly presents sample count confidence as **95% \u00b14%** in a general way (not per-constituency custom). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue201\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n- The CI I computed is **not unusually wide**; it\u2019s basically the publicly cited **\u00b14% at 95%**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- It *feels* wide because:\n  1) the public usually sees **point estimates** (not intervals),  \n  2) **typical errors** are smaller than a 95% band, and  \n  3) many constituencies (especially GRCs) effectively have larger sample sizes than my 6-station toy, so their *true* MOE would often be tighter even if the headline number stays \u201c\u00b14%\u201d.\n\nIf you want, give me a realistic \u201csmall SMC\u201d polling-station count (e.g., 10\u201312 stations), and I\u2019ll redo the same worked example to show how the CI shrinks."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":539,"end_idx":572,"safe_urls":["https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/attachments/2015/09/03/st_20150903_sample03_1656043.pdf","https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/attachments/2015/09/03/st_20150903_sample03_1656043.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/when-will-sample-count-presidential-election-be-announced-how-does-it-work","https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/when-will-sample-count-presidential-election-be-announced-how-does-it-work?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Straits Times](https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/attachments/2015/09/03/st_20150903_sample03_1656043.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"How a sample count is done","url":"https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/attachments/2015/09/03/st_20150903_sample03_1656043.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1764375014.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"When will the sample count for presidential election be announced?
