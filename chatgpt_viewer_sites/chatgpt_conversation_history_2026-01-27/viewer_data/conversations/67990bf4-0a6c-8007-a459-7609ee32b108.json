The minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial and has the property that \\(\\mu_T(T) = 0\\). Moreover, \\(T\\) is diagonalizable if and only if \\(\\mu_T(x)\\) is a product of distinct linear factors (i.e., no repeated roots).\n\n2. **Dual Operator \\(T'\\):**  \n   Define the dual space \\(V^* = \\mathrm{Hom}(V, F)\\). The dual operator \\(T': V^* \\to V^*\\) is given by\n   \\[\n     (T'(f))(v) \\;=\\; f\\bigl(T(v)\\bigr) \n     \\quad\\text{for all }f \\in V^*,\\,v \\in V.\n   \\]\n   Equivalently, \\(T'(f) = f \\circ T\\).\n\n3. **Minimal Polynomial of \\(T'\\) is the Same:**  \n   - We claim that \\(T'\\) satisfies precisely the **same** minimal polynomial as \\(T\\). Indeed, if \\(\\mu_T(x)\\) is the minimal polynomial of \\(T\\), then \\(\\mu_T(T) = 0\\). Because the same polynomial relation carries over to the dual (you can check this by applying \\(\\mu_T(T')\\) to an arbitrary \\(f \\in V^*\\)), it follows that \\(\\mu_T(T') = 0\\). \n   - Hence, the minimal polynomial of \\(T'\\) divides \\(\\mu_T(x)\\). Conversely, one also checks that any polynomial annihilating \\(T'\\) would have to annihilate \\(T\\), giving us equality of minimal polynomials. Therefore\n     \\[\n       \\mu_{T'}(x) \\;=\\; \\mu_T(x).\n     \\]\n\n4. **Equivalence of Diagonalizability:**  \n   - Since \\(\\mu_{T'}(x) = \\mu_T(x)\\), the minimal polynomials of \\(T\\) and \\(T'\\) have the **same roots and same factorization** in \\(F[x]\\).  \n   - Consequently, \\(T\\) is diagonalizable \\(\\Longleftrightarrow\\) \\(\\mu_T(x)\\) splits into distinct linear factors \\(\\Longleftrightarrow\\) \\(\\mu_{T'}(x)\\) also splits into distinct linear factors \\(\\Longleftrightarrow\\) \\(T'\\) is diagonalizable.\n\nHence, **\\(T\\) is diagonalizable if and only if \\(T'\\) is diagonalizable.**\n\n---\n\n### An Alternative Geometric Sketch (Optional)\n\nAnother way to see this (more geometrically) is to use the fact that if \\(T\\) is diagonalizable, then \\(V\\) decomposes as a direct sum of its eigenspaces:\n\\[\n  V \\;=\\; \\bigoplus_{\\lambda} E_\\lambda(T),\n\\]\nwhere \\(E_\\lambda(T) = \\{\\,v \\in V : T(v) = \\lambda v\\,\\}\\). One then considers the induced action on the dual space \\(V^*\\). It turns out that the dual space decomposes correspondingly into generalized eigenspaces (and if the operator is already diagonalizable, these are actual eigenspaces). This sets up a direct correspondence between the eigen-decomposition of \\(T\\) on \\(V\\) and that of \\(T'\\) on \\(V^*\\).\n\nBut the most succinct proof uses the **minimal polynomial** argument given above."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"e4b1c9d7-a1c5-4328-b8cf-26962cd13f79","request_id":"90928253eaa34096-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e4b1c9d7-a1c5-4328-b8cf-26962cd13f79","children":["aaa24b8b-1d7c-4379-89e3-a2a3193b94db"]},"aaa24b8b-1d7c-4379-89e3-a2a3193b94db":{"id":"aaa24b8b-1d7c-4379-89e3-a2a3193b94db","message":{"id":"aaa24b8b-1d7c-4379-89e3-a2a3193b94db","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738090396.059058,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Are there examples where T is unitarily diagonalizable but T' is not?\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"90932f2d0cd4ce65-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e127ab3f-af7a-4b8a-afcf-f320a809ce59","children":["366623e1-0804-402f-b82c-a5ebfaf8521b"]},"366623e1-0804-402f-b82c-a5ebfaf8521b":{"id":"366623e1-0804-402f-b82c-a5ebfaf8521b","message":{"id":"366623e1-0804-402f-b82c-a5ebfaf8521b","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1738090795.08905,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Breaking down the concepts**\n\nI\u2019m learning about unitarily diagonalizable operators in complex vector spaces and how the adjoint operator T# differs from T.

Equivalently, \\(T\\) is unitarily diagonalizable exactly when \\(T\\) is a **normal** operator, i.e.\\ \\(T T^* = T^* T\\).\n\n- The _dual operator_ \\(T'\\) is the induced operator on the dual space \\(V^*\\) defined by \n  \\[\n    (T'(f))(v) \\;=\\; f\\bigl(T(v)\\bigr),\\quad \\forall\\,f\\in V^*,\\,v\\in V.\n  \\]\n  In coordinates (with respect to the usual dual basis), the matrix of \\(T'\\) is simply the **transpose** of the matrix of \\(T\\), not the adjoint.\n\nThe question is:\n\n> **Are there examples of a (complex) linear operator \\(T\\) that is unitarily diagonalizable (i.e.\\ normal) but whose dual operator \\(T'\\) is *not* unitarily diagonalizable (i.e.\\ not normal)?**\n\nThe short (and somewhat surprising) answer is **no**\u2014there are _no_ such counterexamples. Whenever \\(T\\) is normal, its transpose \\(T^\\top\\) (which is the matrix that represents \\(T'\\) in the dual basis) also turns out to be normal. Consequently, \\(T'\\) is itself unitarily diagonalizable if \\(T\\) is.\n\n---\n\n## Why \\(T\\) Normal Implies \\(T^\\top\\) Is Also Normal\n\nLet us spell out why the transpose of a normal matrix is again normal (over the complex field). Recall:\n\n- A matrix \\(M\\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{C})\\) is **normal** if and only if \\(M M^\\dagger = M^\\dagger M\\).  \n  Here \\(M^\\dagger = \\overline{M}^{\\,T}\\) is the usual (conjugate) adjoint.\n\n- The dual operator \\(T':V^*\\to V^*\\) in coordinates is \\(T^\\top\\), meaning \\(\\operatorname{Mat}(T') = (\\operatorname{Mat}(T))^\\top\\).\n\nHence to show \\(T'\\) is normal exactly when \\(T\\) is normal, one needs to check that\n\\[\n  \\bigl(T^\\top \\bigr)\\bigl(T^\\top\\bigr)^\\dagger \n  \\;=\\; \\bigl(T^\\top\\bigr)^\\dagger \\bigl(T^\\top\\bigr),\n\\]\nwhenever \\(T\\) itself satisfies \\(T\\,T^\\dagger = T^\\dagger\\,T\\).\n\n### Key identity: \\((T^\\top)^\\dagger = T^\\dagger{}^\\top\\)\n\nA very standard matrix\u2010manipulation identity is\n\\[\n  (A^\\top)^\\dagger \\;=\\; ( \\overline{A^\\top} )^{\\,\\!T} \n  \\;=\\; \\bigl(\\overline{A}\\bigr)^{T\\,T}\n  \\;=\\;\\overline{A}\n  \\quad\\text{if \\(A\\) is real, but in general}\\quad\n  (A^\\top)^\\dagger \\;=\\; \\bigl(A^\\dagger\\bigr)^\\top.\n\\]\nFor a complex matrix \\(T\\), it is indeed true that\n\\[\n  (T^\\top)^\\dagger \\;=\\; \\bigl(T^\\dagger\\bigr)^\\top.\n\\]\nArmed with that, one checks normality of \\(T^\\top\\) via:\n\n- Start with \\(T\\) normal: \\(T T^\\dagger = T^\\dagger T\\).\n- Take the transpose of that equality: \n  \\[\n    (T\\,T^\\dagger)^\\top \\;=\\; (T^\\dagger\\,T)^\\top,\n    \\quad\\text{i.e.}\\quad\n    (T^\\dagger)^\\top\\,T^\\top \n    \\;=\\; \n    T^\\top\\,(T^\\dagger)^\\top.\n  \\]\n- But \\((T^\\dagger)^\\top = (T^\\top)^\\dagger\\).  So the last identity exactly says \n  \\[\n    (T^\\top)^\\dagger\\,T^\\top \\;=\\; T^\\top\\,(T^\\top)^\\dagger,\n  \\]\n  which is the definition that \\(T^\\top\\) is normal.\n\nTherefore:\n\n> **If \\(T\\) is normal, then its transpose \\(T^\\top\\) is also normal.**  \n\nIn the language of operators on an inner\u2010product space, being \u201cnormal\u201d is equivalent to being unitarily diagonalizable.  Thus if \\(T\\) is unitarily diagonalizable, so is \\(T^\\top\\).  And since \\(T'\\) is represented by \\(T^\\top\\), it follows \\(T'\\) is also unitarily diagonalizable.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n- Algebraically (over any field), \\(T\\) is diagonalizable if and only if \\(T'\\) is diagonalizable (they share the same minimal polynomial).\n- Over \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) with an inner product, \\(T\\) is **unitarily** diagonalizable if and only if \\(T\\) is normal; and it turns out that if \\(T\\) is normal, then \\(T'\\) (represented by \\(T^\\top\\)) is also normal.  \n\n**Hence there is _no_ example** of a normal (unitarily diagonalizable) operator \\(T\\) whose dual \\(T'\\) fails to be normal (unitarily diagonalizable).  In other words:\n\n> **Whenever \\(T\\) is unitarily diagonalizable, so is \\(T'\\).  \n> There are no counterexamples.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"366623e1-0804-402f-b82c-a5ebfaf8521b","request_id":"90932f2d0cd4ce65-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"366623e1-0804-402f-b82c-a5ebfaf8521b","children":[]}}}
