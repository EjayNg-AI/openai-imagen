Here's a precise, step-by-step guide:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Prerequisites\n\n1. Your **computer (running Local)** and your **mobile device** must be on the **same Wi-Fi/network**.\n2. Your firewall must allow **incoming connections** on the port Local uses.\n3. You must **disable site domain rewriting** features like `localhost` or `.local` (which aren\u2019t resolvable by mobile devices).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Steps to Make Your Local Site Accessible to Your Mobile\n\n#### 1. **Find Your Computer's Local IP Address**\n\nOn your local machine (e.g., Mac or Windows):\n\n- **macOS/Linux:**  \n  Run `ifconfig` or `ip a` in terminal and look for `inet` under the active network interface.  \n- **Windows:**  \n  Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt. Look for `IPv4 Address`.\n\nLet\u2019s say your local IP is `192.168.1.123`.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Change the Site Domain to Use the IP Address**\n\nLocal typically uses fake domains like `mysite.local`, which mobile browsers can\u2019t resolve.\n\nDo the following:\n\n1. **In Local**, go to your site settings \u2192 **\u201cSite Domain\u201d**.\n2. Temporarily change the domain to use the IP and a port, e.g.:\n\n   ```\n   http://192.168.1.123:10005\n   ```\n\n3. You may need to use **\u201cCustom Environment\u201d** instead of \u201cPreferred\u201d to enable this flexibility.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Use Local\u2019s Built-in \"Live Link\" (Optional but Handy)**\n\nIf you want a quick way to test on mobile:\n\n1. In Local, enable **Live Link** (Ngrok-powered).\n2. It generates a public URL temporarily tunneled to your local machine.\n3. Use that URL on your mobile. However, note that:\n   - Performance is limited.\n   - It depends on internet access (not truly LAN-only).\n   - Sometimes flaky or blocked on free plans.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Edit `wp-config.php` for IP-based Access (Important)**\n\nWordPress stores the site URL in the DB and uses it for routing. You'll need to **override** it:\n\nAdd this to your `wp-config.php` **above** `/* That's all, stop editing! */`:\n\n```php\ndefine('WP_HOME','http://192.168.1.123:10005');\ndefine('WP_SITEURL','http://192.168.1.123:10005');\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Firewall Rules**\n\nEnsure your firewall allows incoming traffic on the port used by Local. This is typically a random port (e.g., 10005, 10006, etc.).\n\n- **Windows Defender:** Allow the port in Inbound Rules.\n- **macOS Firewall:** Allow connections to `httpd` or Docker (depending on your setup).\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Access from Mobile**\n\nOn your mobile browser:\n\n```plaintext\nhttp://192.168.1.123:10005\n```\n\nYou should see the site, possibly with mixed content warnings if you were using HTTPS locally.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Caveats\n\n- Mobile browsers can't resolve `.local` or `.test` domains.\n- If you're using **SSL**, you'll get **certificate errors** (mobile doesn\u2019t trust self-signed certs). Use plain `http` for testing.\n- If your local IP changes often (e.g., after reboot), you\u2019ll need to update the IP and config accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 Alternative: Use a `.local` domain + Hosts File on Mobile (Advanced)\n\nYou can point your mobile to `mysite.local` by:\n\n1. Rooting/jailbreaking the device and editing `/etc/hosts` \u2014 not recommended.\n2. Setting up a **local DNS resolver** (e.g., Dnsmasq on your router or Pi-hole) and configuring your router to use it.\n3. Setting up **a reverse proxy** (like Nginx) on your computer using a fixed IP.\n\nBut these are overkill unless you're testing on multiple devices regularly.\n\n---\n\nWould you like help automating this setup or creating a script to make the IP setup smoother?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"b4d36929-835d-4a86-b56a-12c1e672a84b","request_id":"92b8c916fb0bce01-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b4d36929-835d-4a86-b56a-12c1e672a84b","children":["3c84e249-eaff-4b7c-9c26-c1e5c7e7df97"]},"3c84e249-eaff-4b7c-9c26-c1e5c7e7df97":{"id":"3c84e249-eaff-4b7c-9c26-c1e5c7e7df97","message":{"id":"3c84e249-eaff-4b7c-9c26-c1e5c7e7df97","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1743853510.076,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["is there a way to make my local machine function as a server so I don't need my mobile to be on same networl?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"92b8cc372c087977-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0428534d-6b59-408a-9119-2a13d9e8fc6d","children":["646b7681-02f8-4342-8340-a53539196d65"]},"646b7681-02f8-4342-8340-a53539196d65":{"id":"646b7681-02f8-4342-8340-a53539196d65","message":{"id":"646b7681-02f8-4342-8340-a53539196d65","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1743853510.685808,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yes \u2014 you **can** make your local machine act as a server accessible from **outside your local network** (i.e., over the internet), but it requires careful setup because you\u2019re essentially exposing your development machine to the public. Here's what you need to know and do, step-by-step:\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f First: Security and Practical Considerations\n\n- **Risk**: You're exposing your dev environment to the internet. That means **you must secure it** (e.g., no open DBs, no admin without passwords).\n- **Performance**: Residential ISPs often limit upload speed and may block ports.\n- **Dynamic IP**: Your public IP may change unless you use a Dynamic DNS service.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Methods to Make Your Local Machine Publicly Accessible\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Option 1: Use Ngrok (Easiest, Fastest)\n\n**Local** comes with built-in support for **Live Links** via **Ngrok**, which tunnels your site over HTTPS to a public-facing address.\n\n#### How:\n- In **Local**, just click **\u201cEnable Live Link\u201d**.\n- Copy the generated URL.\n- Open it on your mobile **from anywhere** (Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G).\n- Done.\n\n#### Pros:\n- Secure (HTTPS).\n- No need for port forwarding.\n- No router config.\n\n#### Cons:\n- Can be **slow** on free plan.\n- URL changes every time unless you pay for a static domain.\n- External dependency.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf10 Option 2: Port Forwarding (Self-host from Your IP)\n\nYou can host your local WordPress site on a public IP via **port forwarding** from your router.\n\n#### Steps:\n\n1. **Find your computer\u2019s local IP address**, e.g., `192.168.1.123`.\n2. **Find the port your local WordPress server uses**, e.g., `10005`.\n3. **Log into your router** and set up **port forwarding**:\n   - External Port: `80` or a custom one (e.g., `8080`)\n   - Internal IP: `192.168.1.123`\n   - Internal Port: `10005`\n4. **Find your public IP** from [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/).\n5. **Access the site from your mobile**:\n   ```\n   http://<your-public-ip>:8080\n   ```\n\n#### Pros:\n- Direct connection, no middleman.\n- Works even with dynamic IP (with caveats).\n\n#### Cons:\n- Your ISP might **block incoming traffic** on port 80 or 443.\n- Dynamic IP can break it unless you use **Dynamic DNS**.\n- Firewall needs to allow the connection.\n- **More exposed to attacks** \u2014 harden your machine.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 Option 3: Use Dynamic DNS (If IP Changes Frequently)\n\nIf you go with port forwarding but your IP changes regularly, use a **Dynamic DNS (DDNS)** provider:\n\n- **Popular DDNS Services**:\n  - [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/)\n  - [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/)\n  - [DynDNS](https://dyn.com/dns/)\n\nThese give you a subdomain like:\n\n```\nhttp://yourname.ddns.net:8080\n```\n\n\u2026and automatically point it to your current IP.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd10 Option 4: Set Up Reverse Proxy + SSL (Advanced, Production-Like)\n\nYou could run **Nginx or Apache** on your machine, reverse proxy to Local, and set up a **Let's Encrypt SSL certificate**. Combined with DDNS and port forwarding, you have a true mini-server.\n\nBut that\u2019s getting into sysadmin territory. Not needed unless you're doing mobile testing that depends on HTTPS + domain logic.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR Decision Guide\n\n| Goal | Recommended Method |\n|------|--------------------|\n| Quick mobile access over internet | Local's **Live Link** (Ngrok) |\n| Long-term external access | **Port forwarding** + Dynamic DNS |\n| Full control, production-style setup | **Nginx reverse proxy** + HTTPS |\n| Just LAN access | Use **Local IP** + override `wp-config.php` |\n\n---\n\nWould you like help configuring a specific one of these (e.g., router setup or reverse proxy config)?
