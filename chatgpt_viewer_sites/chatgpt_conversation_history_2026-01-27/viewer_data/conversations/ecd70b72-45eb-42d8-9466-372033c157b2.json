It is a measure of correlation between a continuous variable and a binary variable that is assumed to be an artificially dichotomized version of an underlying continuous variable. Essentially, the biserial correlation is applied when the binary variable results from categorizing a continuous variable into two groups based on a threshold, and there is interest in estimating what the correlation might have been if the original continuous nature of the variable had been preserved.\n\n### Formula for Biserial Correlation Coefficient\n\nThe formula for the biserial correlation coefficient is more complex than that of the point-biserial correlation and includes the probability density function of the normal distribution:\n\n\\[ r_{b} = \\frac{M_1 - M_0}{s} \\frac{n_1 n_0}{n^2} \\frac{1}{p q} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_0\\) are the means of the continuous variable for the two groups defined by the binary variable.\n- \\(s\\) is the standard deviation of the continuous variable.\n- \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_0\\) are the numbers of observations in each of the two groups.\n- \\(n\\) is the total number of observations.\n- \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the proportions of the total sample in each group (\\(p = \\frac{n_1}{n}\\) and \\(q = \\frac{n_0}{n}\\) with \\(p + q = 1\\)).\n- The term \\(\\frac{1}{p q}\\) is multiplied by the height of the normal curve at the cutoff point (the point dividing the two groups), which requires knowing or assuming the distribution of the underlying continuous variable.\n\n### Key Differences from Point-Biserial Correlation\n\n- **Assumption about the Dichotomization Process**: The biserial correlation assumes that the binary variable was derived from dichotomizing a normally distributed continuous variable. This is a key theoretical difference and makes the biserial correlation more suitable for cases where the binary variable is considered a crude representation of an underlying continuous nature.\n- **Calculation Complexity**: The biserial correlation calculation is more complex and requires additional assumptions, particularly about the distribution of the underlying continuous variable before dichotomization. The point-biserial correlation treats the binary variable as inherently dichotomous without assuming it was derived from a continuous variable.\n\n### Interpretation\n\nLike the point-biserial correlation, the biserial correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with the same interpretation regarding the direction and strength of the relationship between the variables.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe biserial correlation is less commonly used than the point-biserial correlation due to its reliance on additional assumptions about the nature of the binary variable. However, it can provide valuable insights in situations where those assumptions are valid and the interest lies in understanding the relationship as it pertains to the original, unobserved continuous variable."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","default_model_slug":"gpt-4","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa2708b-8797-4db4-b302-1eb5bdfd1ca4","request_id":"86bf6a7d39e49cd1-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2708b-8797-4db4-b302-1eb5bdfd1ca4","children":[]}}}
