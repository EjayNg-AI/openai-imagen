It's a bit nasty   around these things! You cease to right stick  stay together. We're one long string of atoms?  \\n0:09\\nWhat are we? Yeah and then the atoms get  separated. If a black hole will one day   end up as nothing the normal vacuum of space  what happened to you and me? What happened to  \\n0:20\\nall of that stuff? I mean this is the central  question. The laws of nature are quite clear   on this. So that's what bothered everybody for  a very long time. What happened? What's the end  \\n0:29\\nof the story? So what happens - I'm so excited about  this. The video you're about to watch is a deep  \\n0:35\\ndive into the cutting edge research happening  right now about black holes. It's awesome. It's  \\n0:41\\nthe extended cut of an interview that I  did with famous physicist Dr brian Cox for   a shorter huge if True episode all about what  would actually happen if you fell into a black  \\n0:51\\nhole. That episode is incredible and I've linked  to it in the description but there was so much   weird and mindbending stuff in this conversation  that didn't fit into that shorter episode and I  \\n1:01\\nknew that you'd want to see it so we decided  to release the full extended cut. It's just   too cool and I think you'll love it so strap in  because the cutting edge of black holes is wild.\\n1:15\\nGreat would you mind just starting us out by  introducing yourself however you like. Yeah so   I'm Brian Cox and uh if you want the title the  full title I'm professor of particle physics  \\n1:26\\nat the University of Manchester Royal Society  Professor for Public Engagement in Science and   Visiting Scholar at the Creek Institute in  London. And how do you describe what you do  \\n1:35\\nevery day? What I do every day physics um and  that's kind of the way that I see myself if  \\n1:44\\nsomeone asks me what I do I say I'm a physicist  um but actually of course most of my time now  \\n1:50\\nis spent on the the public engagement side so  the and I kind of fell into that accidentally  \\n1:56\\nbut I still maybe it's a thing maybe there's some  deep psychological thing going on but I never say  \\n2:01\\nTV presenter or whatever whatever it is I just  say physicist. Well that's what I want to talk to  \\n2:07\\nyou all about today so imagine that you and I  are on a mission to fall into a black hole and  \\n2:14\\nwe have some imaginary spaceship that can take  us as far and as fast as we want so we get up  \\n2:20\\nwe walk outside we get into our spaceship what  now what is a black hole and how do we find them  \\n2:28\\nso a black hole it's it's interesting that the  idea or the first glimpse of them theoretically  \\n2:36\\ncame very shortly after Einstein's theory of  gravity was published in 1915 although it wasn't  \\n2:42\\nrecognized as such at the time this glimpse but  um essentially what what does Einstein's theory do  \\n2:48\\nit's important for what follows it's a theory of  space and time and how space time which is often  \\n2:55\\ndescribed as the fabric of the universe responds  warps or curves to matter and energy in the in  \\n3:02\\nthe universe so the the equations basically  the theory that Einstein published all those  \\n3:07\\nyears ago will say give me some distribution of  matter some something like a ball of matter and  \\n3:14\\nthe equations will tell you how the fabric of the  universe is distorted and by the way the force   of gravity in that theory then is the response of  everything else in the universe to that distortion  \\n3:25\\nso Einstein would say what are we feeling now  newton would say it's a force between us and the  \\n3:30\\nearth right but Einstein would say there isn't  a force what we're responding to the distortion  \\n3:36\\nin the fabric of the universe created by the  earth so that's John John Wheeler actually the   great physicist put it beautifully he said matter  tells spacetime how to curve and spacetime tells  \\n3:47\\nmatter how to move and that's it right so that's  Einstein's theory so in 1916 shortly after it  \\n3:54\\nwas published a man called Karl Schwarzschild remarkably  managed to solve the equations uh for a perfectly  \\nWarping space and time\\n4:02\\nspherical non-spinning ball of matter it's the  simplest thing you could do which tells you how  \\n4:07\\nspace and time are distorted by it and that's a  model for a star it's the simplest thing you could   do so he he solved the equations it's a remarkable  thing in those equations there is a description  \\n4:18\\nof a black hole although it wasn't realized at  the time it's a remarkable piece simple piece of   mathematics actually um so essentially what's the  idea behind a black hole one way to think about  \\n4:29\\nit is that you could remove could you remove  the star from from this fabric but leave the  \\n4:38\\ndistortion behind so if if you if you do that you  get the description of a black hole but you might  \\n4:44\\nsay what what do you mean that how can that be  formed in nature so you think about what a star  \\n4:50\\nis then a star is a balancing act so it's a it's  a mainly hydrogen and helium collapsing under its  \\n4:57\\nown gravity that's how our sun formed 4 and a half  billion years ago so it's collapsing so what stops  \\n5:02\\nit collapsing well as it collapses the core heats  up and that initiates nuclear fusion reactions in  \\n5:09\\nthe core in in the case of our sun it's hydrogen  being fused into helium that releases energy which  \\n5:15\\ncreates a pressure which holds the thing up  so it's balancing but it needs the fuel and  \\n5:21\\nand it's not infinitely big of course so at some  point it runs out of nuclear fuel and ultimately  \\n5:26\\nno more fusion reactions can occur in any star  and so the star will resume its collapse so the  \\n5:32\\nquestion is well is there something that stops  it because if there isn't something that stops  \\n5:38\\nthe collapse then it will collapse without limit  and and so actually if you look at the history of  \\n5:44\\nphysics in the 20s and 30s people were saying well  we'd like to avoid this idea that the thing will  \\n5:50\\ncollapse without limit because if it does then  Schwarzschild's equation predicts some very strange  \\n5:57\\nthings indeed and so people kind of tried to avoid  it it was really actually Oppenheimer and uh  \\n6:03\\nhis student Schneider in the late 30s just before  the Second World War that showed that really with  \\n6:09\\nsome assumptions it looks like a massive enough  star could actually collapse without limit so  \\n6:15\\nwhat does that mean collapses without limit it  means that essentially it does what I said you  \\n6:21\\nessentially remove the star from the fabric  of the universe leaving the distortion behind  \\n6:27\\nand the black hole the idea behind the black  hole is let's say you take let's say you take  \\n6:34\\nthe sun a star the mass of the sun and you just  collapse it and you keep on collapsing it you get  \\n6:41\\nto a point when the the radius of the sun is not  700,000 kilometers which is what is in miles half  \\n6:48\\na million miles i I I'm going to use kilometers  because I can't remember the things in miles we   can everyone can convert it afterwards right so  7,000 km and you squash it down and you squash  \\n7:00\\nit and squash it until its radius becomes 3 km  three then there are several ways to look at this  \\n7:08\\none is that on the surface the speed you'd have  to travel to escape its gravitational pole it's  \\n7:15\\ncalled the escape velocity would exceed the speed  of light that's one way to think about it so even  \\n7:21\\nlight rays emitted from the surface if you could  squash it down that far would just stay there they  \\n7:27\\nwould not escape because they'd be trying to go at  the speed of light and and the escape velocity is   the speed of light and they just stop so what  what happens then if a star collapses inside  \\n7:38\\nthat number which for the mass of the sun 3 km is  called the swatchial radius then it will collapse  \\n7:44\\nwithout limit nothing will stop it and so all  you will get is essentially the geometry of space  \\n7:51\\nand time the curvature and that's a black hole so  it's a thing that traps light in that sense so you  \\n7:58\\nthink about that if you have this surface uh and  space and time are so distorted there that if you  \\n8:05\\ngo in across that surface it's called the event  horizon of the black hole then you can't get out  \\nWhats inside a black hole?\\n8:12\\nyou one way to think about it is you'd have to  travel faster than light to get out another way   to think about it is that um there's a beautiful  model which is my favorite model it's called the  \\n8:23\\nriver model of a black hole you can write the  equations as as a space being like a river that  \\n8:30\\nflows into this thing almost like a sinkhole or  something in space and the river of space flows  \\n8:36\\nat the speed of light inwards on the horizon and  then faster than light inside so if you imagine  \\n8:42\\nthat you're a a photon a particle of light you're  like a little fish swimming against the tide but  \\n8:49\\nif the tide's going at the speed of fast as  you can swim the speed of light you can't get   out not only can you not get out but you're going  inwards towards something and this thing the the  \\n9:01\\nsomething is called the singularity you say \\\"What  is this thing the singularity?\\\" And I think it's  \\n9:06\\nreally tempting to picture it as some infinitely  dense point to which this star collapsed when you  \\n9:12\\ndraw a map of space and time what you see really  clearly is that this singularity thing is not a  \\n9:19\\nplace in space it's a moment in time and it's  in fact the end of time in Einstein's theory  \\n9:25\\nso so a way that I often kind of picture it or  explain it to myself is that space and time have  \\n9:31\\nbecome so distorted that when you look at it from  the outside they flip roles so space has be space  \\n9:37\\nhas become time and time has become space in the  mathematics if you put a little graphic up you'll  \\n9:43\\nsee that the plus and minus signs in the Schwarzschild and so they they change so what you thought  \\n9:50\\nof as as an infinitely end place in space to  which the star collapsed has become a moment  \\n9:56\\nin time and a way to think about why you have  to go to it then it's really beautiful because  \\n10:02\\num you think it becomes something that's in the  future for anyone or anything that crosses the  \\nPhoto of Sagittarius A\\n10:08\\nhorizon it's in the future so it's like if you say  well I want to escape this thing it's like saying  \\n10:15\\nI want to escape tomorrow if I said to you let's  run away from tomorrow you go I can't run away  \\n10:21\\nfrom tomorrow it's in the future that's what this  thing behaves like a singularity so that's the the  \\n10:27\\nEinsteinian description of a black hole i want  to take that step by step to understand it okay  \\n10:36\\nso in order to understand this let's imagine that  we choose the black hole at the center of our own  \\n10:42\\ngalaxy yeah sagittarius A star I think it's called  I know that we took this picture of it in that is  \\n10:49\\nby the event horizon telescope Sagittarius A  star what are we looking at here so here um  \\n10:56\\nthe light you might say what is the light in this  picture so it's not from the black hole cuz we've  \\n11:01\\njust said black holes trap light it's from what's  called the accretion disc around the black hole  \\n11:07\\nso you're to imagine really material spiraling  around in orbit around this very dense object  \\n11:14\\num and very violently orbiting and so it heats up  and it emits light you imagine a a flat thin disc  \\n11:21\\nof material around the black hole but this does  not look like that um what you're seeing is the  \\n11:28\\ndistortion the curvature of the light rays because  we said that you might think well light travels in  \\n11:34\\nstraight lines um but Einstein's theory says that  in the vicinity of this thing the fabric of the  \\n11:40\\nuniverse itself is distorted so the light the  paths of the light rays follow the distortion  \\n11:47\\njust like that's why in an animation it looks like  it's going over the top and around the sides at   the same time so what you're seeing this famous  image of a black hole like if you think of the  \\n11:54\\nfilm Interstellar that that code by the way is an  implementation of Einstein's equations kip Thorne  \\n12:01\\nand others help them do that so so it's really a  prediction so what you're seeing so imagine this  \\n12:06\\ndisc of material around this thing like picture  in your mind's eye Saturn then light rays let's  \\n12:12\\nsay from your perspective from behind the black  hole on the let's say that on the disc go around  \\n12:20\\ninto your eyes sometimes they orbit and then  go around into your eyes and they go into your  \\n12:26\\neyes from every point on the disc from underneath  and at the top and behind so you have light rays  \\n12:32\\ngoing always around this thing so so then you so  you see that that's what you see as an image so  \\n12:38\\nthere's a prediction of Einstein's theory which  is a real black hole should look like that it's  \\n12:45\\ncharacteristic donut shape that you see well  here's here's an image with radio telescopes of  \\n12:51\\nof such a thing and it looks like the prediction  it is a bit blurry but you know this is at the  \\n12:56\\ncenter of the galaxy very difficult this was  actually the second one that was imaged the   first one was in a galaxy called M87 which is 55  million light years away and is bigger than this  \\nHow big are black holes?\\n13:06\\none bigger which I mean it so this one's about  um 6 million times the mass of the sun give or  \\n13:13\\ntake uh the one in M87 6 billion times the mass  of the sun so this is a baby super massive black  \\n13:18\\nhole that we know so this is my next question  our black hole how big is it compared to other  \\n13:24\\nblack holes that we know exist so it's a it's a  smallalish one you know we And what's this it's  \\n13:29\\nnot smallish it's a it's a super massive black  hole but we think that I would say all galaxies  \\n13:37\\nmaybe the there's an exception or so but pretty  much all galaxies have super massive black holes  \\n13:42\\nat their centers we don't quite know why actually  we we don't quite know how galaxies form in the  \\n13:48\\nearly universe it's one of the uh things that  the JWST the James Web is is is looking at in  \\n13:53\\nsome detail the the new space telescope but um  to good approximation all galaxies have these  \\n14:00\\nthings um and they can be different masses so  as I said the the M87 galaxy has one that's  \\n14:07\\nuh 6 billion times the mass rather than 6 million  times the mass but how big is it so the number I  \\n14:14\\nalways remember in my mind is the swatch radius  of the sun which is as we mentioned it's the the  \\n14:21\\nradius you'd have to squash the sun down to  make a black hole and it's 3 kilometers um so  \\n14:27\\nit goes like the mass so you can work it out so  if it's six if that's 6 million times the mass  \\n14:33\\nof the sun then the swatcher radius is 6 million*  3 km so it's kind of easy to do the math actually  \\n14:39\\nso that would be the the um you might call it  you have to be careful with your language but  \\n14:45\\nlet's let's say that this thing is it gives you  an idea of the size of this structure um so the  \\n14:50\\nthe disc is outside it is much bigger i did the  math with earth's radius and it seemed to suggest  \\n14:57\\nthat we would become a black hole if we compressed  everything on Earth and all of us into something   about the size of a P yeah it's about from memory  about 0.8 cm I think something like that just less  \\n15:09\\nthan a centimeter so you're right about that  that big do black holes that small exist uh  \\n15:14\\nno we don't think so so even black holes the mass  of the sun the the sun will not form a black hole  \\nHow small are black holes?\\n15:21\\nwhen it runs out of nuclear fuel it will collapse  and there's something that can stop it collapsing  \\n15:27\\nthe force of electrons yes so it's called a  white dwarf star it's beautiful calculation  \\n15:32\\nby the way then you can do the calculation it's  great so what what stops it as an aside is that  \\n15:38\\nas you electrons there's something called the  pi exclusion principle i read about this yeah   so electrons don't want to be close together  roughly speaking you can say it like that so  \\n15:46\\nas you squash the thing the electrons get closer  together and so they kind of separate away from  \\n15:52\\neach other and go into smaller and smaller little  regions of space because they're trying to stay   away from each other but there's also something  called the uncertainty principle heisenberg's  \\n16:01\\nuncertainty principle so as you confine them  into smaller regions they they start jiggling  \\n16:07\\naround faster and faster um and ultimately you can  reach a limit where they're essentially trying to  \\n16:12\\njiggle at the speed of light and they can't and so  there's a limit to how much pressure that process  \\n16:19\\ncan exert and it turns out it's 1.4 times the mass  of the sun which is called the Chandra Seca limit  \\n16:25\\nuh so you can do that calculation but it's a  beautiful calculation because you could have   worked that out not knowing that stars exist all  you need to know about is quantum mechanics and  \\n16:36\\nrelativity and you can make the calculation what  is the biggest lump of stuff that can be held up  \\n16:42\\nby this jiggling of electrons it turns out it's  1.4 times the mass of the sun then you look into  \\n16:47\\nthe sky and you see there are these things called  white dwarfs these collapsed stars which are and  \\n16:52\\nthere's none more massive than 1.4 four times  the mass of the sun so it's very beautiful and   then you can get neutron stars which are held up  by the jiggling of neutrons but ultimately if you  \\n17:02\\ngo to something that's three three times the  mass of the sun something like that a bit more   then nothing stops it collapsing and that's when  you form a black hole so the most the lightest  \\n17:12\\nblack holes that we know of around that mass  right and then and then we know of them that  \\n17:18\\nare 10 20 30 times the mass of the sun from  collapsed stars and then these things which  \\n17:24\\nare millions of times or even more the mass of  the sun which are the heart of galaxies so we've  \\n17:30\\nlaunched in our spaceship we are hurtling toward  this black hole could you walk us through step by  \\n17:35\\nstep what happens from now until when we hit the  event horizon yeah so the first thing to say is  \\n17:42\\nthat it's right at the heart of Einstein's  theory is something called the equivalence   principle which was the idea that really led  Einstein to the theory itself of gravity and  \\n17:53\\num so you don't feel its pull you what you do is  you just fall freely towards it so we're falling  \\n17:59\\ntowards this thing now and we turn our rocket  motors off um you we can't tell if we can't look  \\n18:06\\noutside we can't look out the windows we're just  in freef fall we're just floating so it's like the atmosphere we're just there so it's fundamental to  Einstein's theory it's very important actually for  \\n18:21\\nthe problems that follow that we're going to talk  about that you just freely fall towards this thing  \\n18:26\\nso we could be approaching this in this room  now and we would have no clue that that that's  \\n18:33\\nwhat's happening and in fact so we're approaching  the event horizon of a very big black hole like  \\n18:40\\nthis of of a for a black hole of this mass then  we wouldn't even notice something according to  \\n18:47\\nEinstein's theory as we fall across the horizon  into the interior of the black hole so we could  \\n18:53\\nwe would we'd fall across the horizon from our  perspective in this room according to Einstein and  \\n19:00\\nwe'll go for that caveat a bit later but according  to Einstein into the interior of the black hole we  \\n19:06\\ngo and we notice nothing what about when we're in  the accretion desk wouldn't we be banged around by   a lot of So we we get we might get in a bit of  a mess as we pass through the accretion but we  \\n19:15\\nwe're talking about the pure gravitational thing  you're absolutely right it's a bit nasty around  \\n19:20\\nthese things so the stuff but that's nothing to do  with the black hole itself it's nothing to do with  \\n19:26\\nthe fundamental physics it's all the X-rays and  all this nasty gamma all the stuff that's being  \\n19:32\\num radiated from all this hot material around  it so yes that would be a problem but if we  \\nPassing through the event horizon\\n19:38\\nhad a let's say that our room this spacecraft is  magically insul insulated from radiation and heat  \\n19:45\\nand all those things then nothing in we would  go into the interior the caveat please there's  \\n19:53\\na lot of caveats but one thing I should say is  that it matters that that description I've given  \\n19:59\\nit's for a super massive black hole if this was  a smaller black hole so smaller less massive you  \\n20:05\\nknow a few times the mass of the sun then at  some point you experience what's called tidal  \\n20:11\\ngravity tidal forces so those are things that  raise the tides on in the oceans of the earth  \\n20:16\\num it the the tidal forces we will start to in  our freely falling trajectory towards the black  \\n20:24\\nhole at some point you start to get feel the  tides you start to get stretched and squashed  \\n20:31\\nand there's a and we feel it you would start  you'll feel it eventually you'll really feel   it eventually because formally as you get very  close to the singularity you get infinitely  \\n20:40\\nstretched and squashed so you really feel it i  want to talk about that spaghettification yes   that's my favorite but so for for for a for for a  smaller black hole as you approach the horizon you  \\n20:51\\nyou feel those forces but for the big ones you  don't feel the tides until you've gone into the  \\n20:58\\ninterior so we're moving toward the event horizon  where somehow insulated from the messiness of the  \\n21:05\\naccretion disc we're moving toward it i've heard  that there's a moment where the physics of this  \\n21:10\\nare such that if you and I are actually falling  in if we look to the left and the right we would  \\n21:16\\nactually see the back of our own heads is that  anywhere close to correct and can you tell me  \\n21:22\\nabout the other little details as we approach the  event horizon that you think are important well  \\n21:27\\none of the biggest details one of it's not even a  detail it's one of the most shocking things about  \\n21:34\\nthis is I've described this that us falling in to  the black hole and we're saying in this room where  \\n21:41\\nwe can't see out what what do we what do we feel  what can we measure and the answer is you can't  \\n21:47\\nmeasure anything and we don't feel anything until  we get inside and we approach the singularity for  \\n21:53\\nthis one but from the point of view of someone  outside the description is very different so  \\n22:01\\nwhat would they see happening to us as we fall  towards this thing so even in Einstein's theory  \\n22:08\\nwith nothing else no quantum mechanics or anything  then what they would see is time tick more slowly  \\n22:14\\nfor us mhm so they would start to see as we  approached the black hole if they could see  \\n22:21\\nour watches if we were transmitting to them or  whatever it is transmitting from these cameras we   were sending it out to them yeah they they would  start they would see our time tick more slowly  \\n22:31\\nmore slowly more slowly and they would see our  time stop on the horizon so they would never see  \\n22:38\\nus fall in so from the point of view of someone  outside nothing goes into the black hole ever  \\n22:47\\nso what do they see us imprinted there forever or  does the light from us slowly fade until it would  \\n22:53\\nfade because the So also you could picture there  are many ways of picturing it but you could say  \\n22:58\\nthis light is climbing away from this through this  gravitational field so it's getting stretched so  \\n23:04\\nwe get redder and redder and redder redshifted  infinitely redshifted time passes more and more  \\n23:11\\nslowly until it it stops on the horizon when  viewed from the outside from our perspective  \\n23:20\\nwe look at our watches they go 1 second per  second and that's absolutely central there's  \\n23:25\\nnothing we Well there's something weird there  but there isn't according to Einstein so it's   pure Einstein's theory so that's the the first  thing to say and it's a clue of to the interesting  \\n23:37\\nthings about what we're going to talk about what  follows is that there are different perspectives   on what's happening here there's there's a there's  a perspective from our point of view we're going  \\nTwo perspectives\\n23:46\\nin for a big black hole from the point of view of  someone outside we never go in and that's going to  \\n23:52\\nbe kind of important for what follows but there's  nothing that's not described by Einstein's theory  \\n23:58\\nin in that particular bit of the description hang  on let me show you something else that's really   cool this is my privacy dashboard it shows how  many data brokers I've gotten myself removed from  \\n24:08\\nactually our sponsor Incogn has gotten me removed  from so why does this matter well data brokers  \\n24:13\\nmake money buying and selling your information  sometimes they sell to businesses so maybe I get   more spam but also with more data these brokers  can form a picture of you a shadow profile which  \\n24:23\\nthey can then use in ways you might not want but  incogn force many of them to remove you let me  \\n24:28\\nshow you so they reach out to day brokers on my  behalf and they say \\\"Hey remove this person.\\\" And   then crucially they follow up to make sure that I  actually got removed i really appreciate this and  \\n24:37\\nI think you might too if you want to try it out  use the code Cleo Abram at the link below and get   60% off an annual plan now back to black holes so  at this moment we cross the event horizon and we  \\n24:48\\ndon't feel that we could have gone we could have  crossed it now just now wouldn't notice and our  \\n24:55\\nexperience now is completely inside the blackness  of the black hole from an outsers's perspective  \\nSpaghettification\\n25:03\\ngravity is increasing faster and faster and  this is where we get to maybe my favorite word  \\n25:10\\nuh that I have learned in the process of this  which is when the my understanding of this is when   the gravity at your feet is so different from the  gravity at your head that you begin to stretch in  \\n25:22\\na very dramatic way and this is spaghettification  could you explain what is happening here yeah as  \\n25:28\\nyou get one way of thinking about it is that  that the the the another way of thinking about  \\n25:34\\nit is just that the space the distortion in  spaceime is is not constant over the length  \\n25:41\\nof your body so when we're falling in we might  as well be this is the Einstein's equivalence  \\n25:47\\nprinciple in action we might as well be in flat  space because the distortion it's like saying  \\n25:53\\nuh on the surface of the earth um if you look at  a mile a square mile of the surface of the earth  \\n25:59\\nyou don't feel the you don't see the curvature  right you have to go to bigger distances to see   that you're on a curved surface it's kind of like  that so so the the distortion the difference in  \\n26:09\\ngravitational pull as you said or the distortion  you don't feel it until it becomes very distorted  \\n26:14\\nor there's a big gravitational pull when you  get very close to this thing And then you start   to see that and actually it works it's not only  stretching it's also a squashing so the way the  \\n26:25\\ntidal gravity works is to squash in one direction  and pull in the other direction so we are getting   so you feel it so you start to feel this strange  sort of sensation of being stretched and squashed  \\n26:37\\nand and and as you go closer and closer to  the singularity those effects become much   more extreme until this so extreme that first  of all you you cease to right stick stay stay  \\n26:47\\ntogether we're one long string of atoms what are  we yeah and then the atoms get get separated and  \\n26:53\\nthen the protons the quarks inside the protons  will get separated and ultimately according to  \\n26:58\\nEinstein's theory the tidal forces become infinite  So that in formally infinite and so everything has  \\n27:05\\ngone everything has been ripped apart and that  this is what we call the singularity so so the  \\n27:11\\nwhole thing kind of gets very extreme and breaks  down ultimately in Einstein's picture the question  \\n27:18\\nthat when I began this story I wanted to ask you  is what is at the center of a black hole but in  \\n27:23\\ndoing this research I now understand that talking  about the center is also a little bit incorrect  \\n27:31\\nhow should I actually think about what is  happening at that singularity well I mean the   the first thing to say is we don't know right so  so with um we can talk about the current research  \\n27:42\\nand speculation um we don't really have the tools  to describe it so a way to think about Einstein's  \\n27:50\\ntheory is that as I mentioned earlier it really  tells you how space and time are distorted they  \\n27:55\\nalso kind of get mixed get up from from from the  point of view of someone outside so then you'll  \\n28:03\\nsee that space and time are are getting warped and  distorted and as I mentioned they get so mixed up  \\n28:10\\nthat on the horizon you see that they flip um so  the thing to bear in mind for all that follows  \\n28:17\\nwith Einstein's theory is this very central idea  that if you're freely falling through space or  \\n28:26\\nover spacetime if you like then you don't in in  the absence of these tidal effects you you really  \\n28:35\\ncannot tell that you're where you are in the  universe if you're close to a black hole close to  \\n28:41\\na big star orbiting around a galaxy just falling  whatever it is so I think that's the key idea this  \\n28:48\\nso-called equivalence principle um but of course  the as we said before the thing about a black hole  \\n28:56\\nis that why don't you see the you could say why  don't I see these effects on the earth um this  \\n29:01\\ndistortion this mixing or and you do um so you  see it in GPS satellites for example so um if you  \\n29:10\\nthink about what I said I said as you go closer  to this thing then as viewed from the outside time   passes more slowly um so you you could say well  why doesn't the earth do that and it does so what  \\nYou see this on Earth\\n29:23\\nyou see is that time ticks at a different rate  well by which I mean clocks tick at a different  \\n29:28\\nrate atomic clocks or biological clocks so you age  at a different rate in orbit than you do on the  \\n29:35\\nsurface of the Earth and you're seeing this is the  same effect the the reason it gets very extreme  \\n29:41\\nand I should say it's quite a big effect for even  near the earth so the drift is tens of thousands  \\n29:49\\nof nanconds per day time the the a difference in  the rate that time passes at the at the orbit of a  \\n29:57\\na GPS satellite and on the ground and we have to  accommodate for that accommodate for that other   it doesn't work but it's tens of thousands  of nanconds per day even around the earth  \\n30:07\\nso the question of black hole really is as you  said before if I could keep the mass of the Earth  \\n30:13\\nthe same but shrink it down to the size of a P  then how much how does that distortion change as  \\n30:19\\nI go closer and closer to this immensely massive P  thing then how does and and the that's this is the  \\n30:26\\neffect that that time keeps going more and more  slowly from the perspective of someone outside  \\n30:32\\nuntil you see it stop on the horizon which as we  said for the earth is around a centimeter just a  \\n30:38\\nlittle bit less um so so it's not it's kind of not  in some ways this behavior of time is not it's not  \\n30:45\\nunique to a black hole it's just that in the black  hole it becomes extreme mhm because the thing has  \\n30:52\\ncompletely collapsed so we have passed through the  event horizon we have been spaghettified we have  \\n30:59\\nhit the end of time this is a question I think I  know the answer to but I think it leads us into  \\n31:06\\nour next section the question is can we ever get  back out so yeah so the the answer is according  \\nCan we get out? Maybe!\\n31:14\\nto Einstein's theory no um because you've gone to  the end of time right and there's no way basically  \\n31:22\\nEinstein would say it's it's all over you've you  know you've got ripped to bits everything has  \\n31:28\\ngot ripped to bits you've gone to this infinitely  distorted space and time and it's just done what  \\n31:34\\nwould Stephen Hawking say well Stephen Hawking  initially would have said in the 1970s um well  \\n31:42\\nwe should say what did Stephen Hawking discover  in the 1970s so in his words he discovered that  \\n31:47\\nblack holes ain't so black so we've said  nothing comes out of a black hole everything   that goes in goes to the singularity it's gone  forever because the black hole lives forever  \\n31:59\\nnow Stephven Hawking um calculated that if you  do some essentially quantum mechanics right so  \\n32:07\\nso around the horizon of the black hole so you  think about what happens what does a black hole do  \\n32:14\\na way of thinking about this is that in quantum  mechanics which means in reality in nature uh  \\n32:21\\nempty space isn't empty it has a rich structure so  the vacuum of space has a structure and the black  \\n32:28\\nhole You might say well this strange behavior  of space and time it must do something and it   does it disrupts that structure and the result  is that particle photons essentially but what's  \\n32:41\\ncalled Hawking radiation is emitted from the black  hole so the result and there are different ways of  \\n32:48\\nthinking about what's happening there's the the  very precise way steven Hawking gave an analogy  \\n32:54\\nin his paper um and he said it's just an analogy  and people get very worked up online when you talk  \\n33:00\\nabout his analogy but Steven did write it down  right so a way to picture the quantum vacuum  \\n33:08\\num is that you can imagine particles coming in  and out of existence all the time in the vacuum  \\n33:14\\nso in accord with the uncertainty principle they  come in and out and in and out like that you can   kind of picture it like that I emphas empasize  it's not supposed to be a technical description  \\n33:23\\nbut you can picture so you can picture these uh in  the vicinity of the horizon you can picture that  \\n33:31\\nthis structure gets disrupted you could you could  have the situation where one of these particles is  \\n33:37\\non the inside and one is on the outside and then  we know what's happening to the one on the inside  \\n33:42\\nit's going to the singularity because we said the  river of space is going fast in there or whatever   whichever way you want to think about it so the  other one is basically made real and and and  \\n33:53\\nescapes so that's a picture that Steven himself  gave um but the upshot is very accurate the point  \\n34:01\\nis that this particle has been shaken out of the  vacuum and it's now a real particle when viewed  \\nThe central question\\n34:06\\nfrom the outside and it goes away so so that  what what is that what particle's been emitted  \\n34:12\\nit's a temperature is glowing and so that means  it's losing energy and so that means it has a  \\n34:18\\nlifetime so over time and these are enormous times  far greater than the current age of the universe  \\n34:25\\nfor any black hole that we know of in the universe  because we don't know of tiny ones so all the ones  \\n34:31\\nwe know of the immense lifetimes in excess of 10  to the^ 100 years for these super massive ones  \\n34:39\\nright it's ridiculous times but ultimately they  have a lifetime and that means one day it will be  \\n34:45\\ngone and space will be all nice and normal again  right all you will have left will be the Hawking  \\n34:51\\nradiation that's been emitted over these eons  of time okay I think something is missing from  \\n34:58\\nmy understanding of the universe i agree with you  something's missing in my understanding as well  \\n35:04\\nand everybody else's but here's what I think is  missing from mine right now so all of this matter  \\n35:11\\nhas including us passed through the event horizon  ended up at the singularity it is something in  \\n35:19\\nthere at the end of time so yeah and it would  increase the mass of the black hole and the  \\n35:24\\nblack black hole would grow right because you've  gone in um and also I think that I know that every  \\n35:32\\nlaw that we have about the universe says that  information is conserved if a black hole will  \\n35:39\\none day end up as nothing the the normal sorry the  normal vacuum of space what happened to you and me  \\n35:50\\nwhat happened to all of that stuff i mean this  is the central question so um Steven's initial  \\n35:55\\ncalculation 1974 um was that this radiation  the Hawing radiation is informationless it's  \\n36:06\\ninformation free so it's not gone away it's not  disappeared the black hole it's turned into the   radiation right um and but his calculation said  there's no information in that it's what's called  \\n36:18\\nthermal purely thermal not surprising if you think  about it because it's been kind of shaken out of  \\n36:24\\nthe vacuum of space so it's certainly you would  think got nothing to do with the stuff that falls  \\n36:30\\nin this is something to do with the horizon it's  not anything to do with the singularity this stuff  \\n36:37\\nso so out it comes and the calculation is very  clear so that would suggest as you said that the  \\n36:44\\ninformation any record of anything that fell in  will have been erased the energy will be the same  \\n36:51\\nright the energy is conserved the the black hole  hasn't vanished it's turned into radiation but the  \\n36:56\\nradiation contains no trace of anything that fell  in that is weird um as you said because if you  \\n37:02\\nthink let's imagine you might say well what's the  difference what if I get this piece of paper and   set fire to it it goes and there's just stuff  ashes and radiation yes but in principle then  \\n37:15\\nif you could just measure everything which you  can't but if you could then you could reconstruct  \\n37:21\\nthe information on the page and you can see why  because it's got something what's happening when  \\n37:26\\nyou burn it is chemical reactions and and there's  oxidation whatever it is and but you can trace  \\n37:31\\neverything back so you can say all the atoms and  things are still around and yeah and there it is  \\n37:36\\nin a black hole you can't so so it wasn't  surprising what was surprising is that that  \\n37:44\\nit appears there is a calculation that tells  you that black holes erase everything and as  \\n37:49\\nyou said the laws of nature are quite clear  on this information does not get destroyed in  \\n37:55\\nthe universe it gets scrambled so you can never  reconstruct it but it doesn't get destroyed so   that's what bothered everybody for a very long  time h what happened what's the understanding  \\n38:07\\nso the end of the story we're not at the end of  the story yet but in 2019 a series of papers were  \\nWhat bothered everybody\\n38:13\\npublished one of the papers was by Jeff Pennington  and the other one was by another group of authors  \\n38:19\\num but those papers suggest that Steven missed  a bit in his calculation very subtle he could  \\n38:29\\nhave never seen it yeah i mean that's why it took  you know 50 years right to see what he'd missed  \\n38:35\\nbut it turns out that the radiation is not  information free at the end of the process  \\n38:42\\nthen all the information about everything that  fell in is imprinted in the radiation as you   would normally expect um but you might but then  it becomes interesting because you say well okay  \\n38:54\\nso there's a calculation this mathematics that was  done but you say well what's the picture then what  \\n39:00\\nhappened because I I understand if I if I take  this and throw it into the black hole it's gone   across the horizon it's gone to the singularity  it's definitely true that nothing comes out of  \\n39:11\\nthe black hole you know but so so how is this  information about this thing getting imprinted  \\n39:18\\nin the radiation And it turns out that it's not  just so initially quite a few people thought well  \\n39:24\\nit must be just right at the end when when it's  all quantum gravity and all this stuff so the   thing's just about to disappear back into the  universe and it's getting hotter and hotter by  \\n39:33\\nthe way as it gets smaller and smaller so there's  more and more it's getting more and more violent   and something weird happens and everything comes  out but um it was known for a long time his work  \\n39:44\\nby a great physicist called Don Page that the  problem about this the about the information and  \\n39:52\\nand and and the structure of space these problems  occur about halfway through the black hole's life  \\n39:59\\nso that it's called the page time so the problems  with the information structure of this thing occur  \\n40:08\\nway before you should be thinking about quantum  gravity and a load of weird stuff so so there was  \\n40:14\\na big challenge to physics it's like we should  be able to calculate stuff when the black hole  \\n40:19\\nis halfway through its life there's nothing weird  at the horizon but yet something weird appears to  \\n40:25\\nbe happening the picture of the thing is breaking  down um and so then we could skip if you want to  \\n40:32\\nthe So what is what is the picture of this and  I should emphasize the health warning here this   is ongoing research and there is no agreed upon  picture and there's some other subtleties we'll  \\n40:42\\ntalk about in a minute but but a picture of what's  happening is this is related to it's related to  \\n40:49\\nsomething called the holographic principle at some  level we think and um so um another discovery that  \\n40:55\\nwas made in the 70s which is quite interesting  by quite I'm using it in the American sense it's  \\n41:01\\nvery interesting is that um so Jacob Beckinstein  um one of the pioneers along with Steven Hawking  \\n41:09\\ncalculated what's called the entropy of a black  hole so this thing has a temperature steven  \\n41:14\\ncalculated the temperature that is inscribed  on his gravestone in Westminster Abbey his  \\n41:19\\nequation for the temperature of a black hole so  it's a huge fundamental discovery temperature  \\n41:25\\num is now we understand it now we didn't when  we first introduced the concept we didn't know  \\n41:30\\nabout atoms and molecules then we did and we we  realize that temperature is about how fast the  \\n41:36\\nthe component parts jiggle around of a thing right  so in this water here you heat it up the molecules  \\n41:42\\nare jiggling around faster that's what temperature  is this thing a black hole think about what this  \\n41:47\\nis i said the description of it is just space and  time that's all it is it's geometry so immediately  \\n41:54\\nwe've got the temperature of a geometry not a  temperature of a thing made of stuff but just  \\n42:00\\na temperature of space right so that's kind of  interesting and then Beckenstein calculates that  \\nInformation encoded in pixels?\\n42:08\\nthis thing has an entropy which implies that  it hides information from us there's there's a  \\n42:13\\nstructure there's information in there the entropy  turns out to be equal to equal to the surface area  \\n42:22\\nof the event horizon in what's called square  plank lengths so this is a remarkable idea that  \\n42:29\\nyou can think of the horizon and I said remember  it doesn't really it's not really there from our   perspective i said we could be falling through it  now wouldn't notice anything according to Einstein  \\n42:39\\nin we go but then you look at it from the outside  and it looks like there's information encoded on  \\n42:45\\nthe horizon in pixels that are one plank length  in size so what does that mean information's  \\n42:54\\nencoded on in space somehow on the surface and  also by the way it's weird isn't it if I said  \\n43:01\\nhow much information is contained in this room  you would say well it's to do with the volume   of the room right it's the library it's how many  books can I fit in the library this is saying no  \\n43:11\\nat a fundamental level the amount of information  in this room is is is determined by the surface  \\n43:16\\narea of the room not the volume so it's almost  as if nature has said you can paper the outside  \\n43:22\\nof the library with the pages of the book but  there is it's almost like there is no interior  \\n43:28\\nto this thing so you start to get these hints that  there's something very strange going on um what is  \\n43:34\\nhappening here um so we've got this picture now  which was in the 1970s of this thing that has a  \\n43:41\\ntemperature and an entropy which are calculated  and so that kind of is suggestive of substructure  \\n43:50\\nbut structure of space and time what do we mean  by that so nobody knows nobody knew that right so  \\n43:57\\num then so there's there's another thing that  come another property that then comes which is  \\n44:04\\nwhy I was careful about us falling in and I kept  saying from our perspective nothing happens so you  \\n44:10\\ngot this Hawking radiation is it's coming from the  disruption of the vacuum in in one picture so it's  \\n44:16\\nall there and it's coming away and it's climbing  away from this black hole it's losing energy and  \\n44:21\\nso it's very low temperature by the time you're  far away from this thing but you go in towards   it then towards the horizon if you lowered a  thermometer down from far away so our friends are  \\n44:32\\nin a spacecraft now you got a thermometer and they  lower it down the the idea is that it sees hotter  \\n44:38\\nand hotter temperatures because you're getting  closer and closer to this horizon so you've   got like a fishing rod around your sending a  thermometer down and it's going hotter and hotter  \\n44:48\\nfrom the point of view of someone outside from  the point of view of someone falling in there's no   temperature at all right you don't see anything  you don't feel anything you don't measure any  \\n44:57\\nHawking radiation you just go in because you're  in freef fall so from your perspective nothing's  \\n45:03\\nhappening from the outside you've got this high  temperature so from the outside a description of  \\n45:11\\nwhat happens to us is is different the description  of what happens to us is that we get vaporized  \\n45:18\\nwe never get spaghettified as I said you know  the other thing is we never go in right so what  \\n45:23\\nhappens to us we get vaporized before we cross the  horizon and and all the all our ashes and all the  \\n45:29\\nstuff comes out and it and you could collect it  and you could say well that's fine great it's just  \\n45:36\\nlike burning a piece of paper but Einstein's  theory is absolutely clear that from our  \\n45:41\\nperspective we go in we get spaghettified so the  from our perspective our demise the description  \\n45:48\\nof our demise is spaghettification y from the  exterior perspective the description of our  \\n45:54\\ndemise is incineration right so which one is it so  you say Well come on you either get incinerated or  \\n46:02\\nspaghettified which one the the modern view  at some level that is much debated goes all  \\n46:09\\nthe way back to work by Leonard Suskin and Jared  Tahuft and some others uh it's called black hole  \\n46:16\\ncomplimentarity and the idea is that both pictures  are correct from different points of view this is  \\nBlack hole complementarity\\n46:23\\nrelativity in action right so the idea is both  pictures are correct now so there is some it's  \\n46:31\\nnot as simple as that and that even is not simple  because there's other stuff going on here but so  \\n46:38\\nyou might say well okay so I understand sort of  this idea that the information essentially you're  \\n46:46\\nsaying that from the outside things fall in and  get scrambled up and they're somehow stored close  \\n46:51\\nto the horizon and you can obviously imagine  these bits of information coming off as the   Hawking radiation no nothing really goes in and  so it's fine i understand how that stuff got out  \\n47:01\\nbut then the question is what happens what's the  description of that from the from our perspective   going in then because we definitely went in right  so we we we've gone in from our point of view what  \\n47:13\\nhappens what's the other description are there  two of us no that's a great question it's a So  \\n47:21\\nyou might say well we get copied then so there's  a copy of us mate it's like blender suskin calls  \\n47:26\\nit a quantum xerox machine I think so he says is  it a quantum xerox thing this do we get copied so  \\n47:33\\nbut there's a very fundamental theorem in quantum  mechanics called the no cloning theorem which says  \\n47:39\\nyou can't copy a quantum state you can't copy the  information and this is fundamental so you this is  \\n47:45\\na problem in quantum computing when you're trying  to it's another whole other discussion so so it's  \\n47:51\\nnot copied so what's the description so this  is where we get speculative and we're trying  \\n47:58\\nto understand what the mathematics is saying one  perspect one description of the of our perspective  \\n48:04\\nis yeah we get we go to the singularity we get all  scrambled up and then it looks like the interior  \\n48:12\\nof the black hole is in some sense the same  place as the exterior you could almost picture  \\n48:18\\nwormholes opening up from the interior of the  black hole to the exterior and very naively you  \\n48:26\\nimagine our bits of information going through the  wormholes and coming out again so so you we end  \\n48:32\\nup outside the information ends up outside in the  Hawking radiation how it gets there is it really  \\n48:41\\nwormholes that are connecting the interior to are  we really is that what's happening there is a an  \\n48:48\\nidea that's been around for a long time again due  to Suskin and others called ER equals EPR which is  \\n48:55\\nEinstein Rosen equals Einstein Podolski and Rosen  okay so Einstein Pidolski and Rosen very famous  \\n49:02\\npaper was about quantum entanglement in the 30s  they wrote this paper and it was it was they were  \\n49:08\\nvery concerned about if you have these um quantum  systems that are so-called entangled systems then  \\n49:15\\nyou can make a measurement on this thing over  here and instantly this one which might be a light  \\n49:20\\nyear away can will will have to right configure  itself the the classic example is a quantum coin  \\n49:27\\nso you can have a quantum coin in a in a quantum  state which can be heads tails plus tails heads  \\n49:35\\nlet's say that with a one over root two whatever  so if it's in that state then it means that's a  \\n49:42\\nfull description of the state heads tails plus  tails heads it means that if you separate these  \\n49:48\\nquantum coins they could be an electron right you  separate the quantum coins to a large distance  \\n49:54\\nthen it's still the case that this thing is in  this what's called a superp position of heads   and tails then you you you make a measurement  of it you make an observation whatever that  \\n50:04\\nyou want to describe it and if that one comes up  heads then you know this one is tails even though  \\n50:13\\nbefore you did anything to this they were both  in this rather this this entangled state right  \\n50:18\\nso so that bothered everybody Einstein Rosen and  they said maybe there's something else going on  \\n50:24\\nand whatever but we think that's the way the world  is now Einstein Rosen is the paper that Einstein  \\n50:30\\nand Rosen wrote noticing that the Schwarzfield  description of a black hole has a wormhole in it  \\n50:36\\nso it's a wormhole so Einstein Rosen is a wormhole  e is quantum entanglement So there's been this  \\n50:43\\nidea that that the same picture of this so you  can picture quantum entanglement somehow as a  \\n50:48\\nwormhole between the two things linking them yeah  so this was an idea from a long time ago and um so  \\n50:56\\nthe picture of a black hole is kind of similar to  that in that you we we're developing this picture  \\n51:03\\nwhere the interior of the black hole when viewed  from one perspective is the exterior of the black  \\n51:10\\nhole when viewed from another perspective and so  you you're what you're getting there we think and  \\n51:17\\nthis is and again even as I say this there are  papers being written saying different thing it's  \\n51:22\\nit's really cutting edge stuff but I think what  everybody agrees on pretty much is that you're  \\n51:29\\nseeing something called the holographic principle  at work here so it's a dual description of nature  \\nHolographic principle\\n51:35\\nso there's a very famous paper by Maldesina called  it's called the ads CFT conjecture and I think it  \\n51:42\\nI'm right in saying it's the most cited paper in  all of theoretical physics is and it's a it was a  \\n51:48\\nvery particular model of of quantum mechanics on  a surface that's what CTF conformal field theory  \\n51:57\\nit means it's quantum mechanics on a surface  and a and a precise proof that there's a jewel  \\n52:02\\ndescription that this quant Quantum theory  describes an interior geometry of space which  \\n52:09\\nis was not there in in the in the in the surface  theory and the space is called an ads space antid  \\n52:16\\nspace or whatever but it's a very it's a perfect a  proof that there's a onetoone description between  \\n52:24\\nthese two things and I I think it's fair to say  that the black holes the these strange apparent  \\n52:31\\nparadoxes are telling us that such such a thing  our universe can be described in such a way so  \\n52:38\\nthere are different ways of describing the same  physics um and they're radically different ways  \\n52:44\\nultimately the thing is it shouldn't be so  problematic in that in both descriptions the  \\n52:52\\ninformation comes out mhm but the way it came out  is radically different depending on your point of  \\n52:59\\nview and I so I think most people would say we're  seeing glimpses of of of some kind of holographic  \\n53:07\\nthey're called holographic by the way because  if you think of um what does it mean to have a  \\n53:13\\ncomplete description of of a higher dimensional  thing so let's let's be very concrete this room  \\n53:20\\nso let's say that this principle is correct and  many people think it is by the way for this for   this room so we have a surface surrounding the  room the walls let's say and there's a theory that  \\n53:31\\nlives just there and it describes fully everything  that's in the room in that sense we're holograms  \\n53:38\\nwe are both holograms because we're described by a  theory that is is lives on a I mean a hologram is  \\n53:45\\na piece of film like that and it has a perfect  a perfect hologram would be a perfect 3D image  \\n53:50\\nwould be encoded in the surface so it's a perfect  3D image encoded in this 2D surface that really is  \\n53:58\\nthe picture that we're talking about here you  can see it with the event horizon and all the   information on the outside and is the interior  there and what happens so it it looks like we're  \\n54:08\\nflipping between descriptions of the world does  it feel sometimes like that story about um a  \\n54:16\\none-dimensional being meeting a two-dimensional  being and trying to describe their circumstances   and then a two-dimensional being and and that we  are somehow like seeing the weirdness of our own  \\n54:28\\nexperience of dimensionality and that there is as  you said if someone were viewing us from a higher  \\n54:34\\ndimension they would see this somehow clearly  and I don't really know what I'm asking no no  \\n54:39\\nI know you I know you it's It's kind of Yeah you  What we seem to be struggling with Yeah is as you  \\n54:46\\nsaid it's this it's almost the same struggle as  as a two-dimensional being trying to understand  \\n54:53\\na three-dimensional world or actually we do  the it's it's three-dimensional beings trying  \\n54:58\\nto understand the four-dimensional world which  is what relativity is we struggle with it it's   hard for us um so this is a level of abstraction  further it's it's we I think one I saw described  \\nIt\u2019s hard for us\\n55:13\\nsomeone described the black hole as why are we  glimpsing this deeper structure of nature in it  \\n55:19\\nwhen we think about black holes which are real  things and I saw someone say it's almost as if  \\n55:24\\nthis thing slices through space and leaves the  building blocks of space dangling right at the  \\n55:30\\nhorizon so you can it's this strange behavior of  of of which gravity has created this situation  \\n55:39\\nwhere you start to come face to face with the with  what with theru with the structure of space and  \\n55:46\\ntime so we we're we're talking about as I said  before that in retrospect the hints were there  \\n55:53\\nwith temperature and entropy and information in  space encoded enclos encoded in space why so it  \\n56:01\\nlooks like we're trying starting to glimpse  a theory of the underlying structure of space  \\n56:06\\nand time so this goes by the name of emergent  spacetime um so the picture really would be that  \\n56:12\\nyou have uh a description which looks by the way  for all the world like a network of cubits which  \\nThe universe as a network of qubits\\n56:19\\nis what a quantum computer is right so it looks  like there's a description of the universe that  \\n56:25\\ndoesn't have space and time in it but is just  a network it's just information and that goes  \\n56:31\\nall the way back to John Wheeler we mentioned him  once the great physicist John Wheeler who had an   idea he used to call the it from bit so it is this  and bit is information that's what it looks like  \\n56:43\\nwe're seeing so our window onto this deeper theory  call it quantum gravity if you like it has been  \\n56:51\\nvery simple questions actually about black holes  which are real things that very simple question  \\n56:58\\nfrom Steven Haw that's why Hawings calculation is  so important because it's the first glimpse of a  \\n57:06\\nproblem with our picture of the world and it's  a very very precise glimpse so it's a precise  \\nWhy black holes teach us so much\\n57:16\\nquestion does this thing destroy information  or not if it doesn't how does the information  \\n57:22\\nget out that's a simple question but it's lead  and is still leading which is why I'm waving my  \\n57:29\\nhands around a lot you you would get a different  different pictures from any any you know expert  \\n57:35\\nwho does the calculations i'm not one of those  right but if you talk to someone who does the   calculations they would not be certain about  the physical picture i think it's fair to say  \\n57:46\\nso is it fair to say that the specific research  into black holes the specific questions that we're  \\n57:53\\nasking about black holes are helping us unlock  much much deeper questions about the universe  \\n57:58\\nas a whole exactly it's very well put and it's  wonderful and and one of the wonderful things is  \\n58:05\\nthat so the the techniques that you develop as a  let's say a PhD student or a posttock or someone  \\n58:12\\nwho's working in this area the techniques that  you develop to try to understand what the black   hole is doing are the same techniques you need if  you want to understand how quantum computers work  \\n58:24\\nso and that's a real engineering question as well  as a fundamental physics question you know we're  \\n58:30\\ntrying to build these things we we haven't  built one that works in the way we want to   yet but obviously Google and Microsoft and IBM  and and others are pouring a lot of money into  \\n58:39\\nit because they're profoundly powerful devices  but the insight a lot of insight now into how  \\n58:48\\nthey might work and how we might build them is  coming from this field of emerging spacetime  \\n58:55\\nso it's the best example I know of you know if you  say to a funding agency um I want to I want money  \\n59:04\\nfrom to to work on black holes they go well they  they fortunately they do give us some money but  \\n59:10\\nthey often will go what is it any use I mean what  the point you know a black hole does anybody care  \\n59:16\\num the lesson is that when you study nature and  you go to the you try to study things that you  \\n59:24\\ndon't you don't understand that uh pose profound  questions about our understanding of physics in  \\n59:31\\nthis case then you are I would say likely to learn  something useful because you're studying reality  \\n59:38\\nand this is the best example of that that I  know for because you're studying completely  \\n59:44\\ncollapsed stars or the things at the hearts of  galaxies and you're gaining insight into quantum  \\n59:50\\ncomputers and networks of cubits and quantum  information it's it's the most wonderful thing  \\n59:57\\nit's incredible so there's one thing I should  mention for a complete um picture for people who  \\n1:00:04\\nare listening or watching and want to know more  there's a thing called which is really important   called the firewall paradox as it was initially  introduced and I I it hasn't been resolved yet  \\nThe firewall paradox\\n1:00:17\\nand and the problem is that um when you when you  disrupt space in this way that the black hole does  \\n1:00:27\\nand when you try to understand what's happening to  the information and and and then tangled particles  \\n1:00:33\\nthat are on one side of the horizon and the  other side you know the hawking radiation that   we discussed earlier um you can you do bump  up against a problem which is that maybe this  \\n1:00:46\\ndescription of the equival equivalence principle  and of us freely falling across the horizon from  \\n1:00:52\\nour perspective into the interior of the black  hole maybe that doesn't quite stand up so maybe  \\n1:00:59\\nyou're getting a challenge to the this basis of  general relativity maybe it's really true that  \\n1:01:06\\nactually there isn't an interior of the black hole  maybe it's really true that you don't go in there  \\n1:01:11\\nisn't an in right and so it's um you'll see if you  go and search through the literature that the the  \\n1:01:19\\nthe firewall paradox was that these papers were  big papers in this debate and then some people  \\n1:01:26\\nthought they were solved and other people thought  they weren't solved and I think it's fair to say  \\n1:01:31\\nthat the jury is still out on these issues but  what what the thing to emphasize is it's really  \\n1:01:37\\nthere's something really fundamental going on here  and it probably it almost certainly is associated  \\n1:01:44\\nwith this the nature of space and time themselves  or spaceime it's associated with geometries of  \\n1:01:51\\nspace time maybe wormholes maybe those kind of  things so it's tremendously interesting and and  \\n1:02:00\\nyou'll see it's just wonderful to dig into this  subject because it's so so it develops so fast  \\n1:02:07\\nand our understanding is developing so fast but  the the last thing to say is it does look like  \\n1:02:12\\nthat that there is a description of the universe  that looks like a giant quantum computer in some  \\n1:02:20\\nsense which does not imply that someone built  it right it doesn't simul but it does suggest  \\n1:02:29\\nthat there's a good description of reality that  you can write down in the form of some kind of  \\n1:02:35\\nnetwork of entangled cubits which are presumably  the plank length inside who know maybe even that's  \\n1:02:43\\nnot obvious right but something like that you know  I came into this story thinking that I was going  \\n1:02:50\\nto tell about falling into a black hole and then  eventually get to the cutting edge of research   into black holes and that that was going to  be the end of the story but actually what I'm  \\n1:02:58\\nhearing you say now is that the cutting edge of  research into black holes is actually a cutting  \\n1:03:04\\nedge of research into the universe itself and  that is just incredibly exciting it's it's really   beautiful isn't it they're the window like almost  like the Rosetta stones that allowing allowing us  \\n1:03:15\\nto translate between different pictures of the  universe all right so that's probably where we  \\n1:03:22\\nend yeah if I rewind for a second one of  my questions to just connect things that  \\n1:03:27\\nI know about the universe maybe is what is the  relationship we think between the singularity at  \\n1:03:35\\nthe center of a black hole and the point that big  banged oh so you it's a it's a very good question  \\n1:03:43\\nthat this thing so the the singularity in inside a  black hole in Einstein's theory is the end of time  \\n1:03:50\\nand in Einstein's theory alone of the evolution  of the universe there is another singularity at  \\n1:03:57\\nthe other end of time which is the big bang  singularity which you might call you might  \\n1:04:03\\nbe tempted to call the beginning of time um it's  a very different singularity um black holes are  \\n1:04:11\\num maximally scrambled information right the  highest entropy things we know of in the universe  \\n1:04:19\\nand one of the great mysteries about the origin of  the universe is it's a very low entropy state um  \\n1:04:25\\nbroadly speaking you can if you want to know  more about that Sean Carol actually writes a   lot about this so it's it's there's a lot of  interesting to say but it's a different kind  \\n1:04:34\\nof singularity um and so are they related is is  the question i I would say yeah our understanding  \\n1:04:43\\nof them surely is um and and but but it's really  not clear and when you add quantum mechanics in  \\n1:04:52\\nthen you begin to ask questions about whether  the big bang sing if there is such a thing as  \\n1:04:57\\na singularity in the past is it what is it is it  the beginning of time there's a thing called the   no boundary idea that Hawking and others had and  you know again all bets are off right but I think  \\n1:05:08\\nit would be good i I think not would be good it it  is correct to say that I'm sure the understanding  \\n1:05:16\\nof the two is related but we understand neither  at the moment level I'm sure that I am garbling  \\n1:05:26\\nfragments of understanding from things that  you have explained but does it feel related   at all that there is the hologram principle the  hologram paradox that you described that we can  \\n1:05:37\\nbe described as two dimensional that there can  be a twodimen dimensional kind of description of  \\n1:05:44\\na huge amount of mass threedimensional mass that  fell into a black hole and that we can all is it  \\n1:05:52\\npossible that we are all living on the outside  of a black hole right now what is the question  \\nAre we living on the outside of a black hole?\\n1:05:59\\nI'm trying to ask no I I think I it's a great  question i I think there is a question so there is  \\n1:06:06\\na cosmological horizon there are different kinds  of cosmological horizons and it is a a a very good  \\n1:06:13\\nquestion that but people don't really even know  how to phrase it that but could it be that you can  \\n1:06:21\\ndescribe the whole universe in terms of a quantum  theory living on a boundary of some description  \\n1:06:29\\nand I think the guess is yes the the guess but  we don't even know what we mean by the boundary  \\n1:06:36\\nright um it's one of the problems here so the  the reason that Maldesina was able to show this  \\n1:06:44\\nis this works for this very specific thing called  ads space is because there's a boundary you can  \\n1:06:52\\nidentify in that particular geometry whereas  our universe is dissa right there isn't it's  \\n1:06:59\\nnot obvious what you mean by a boundary it's  not really obvious what question you know as  \\n1:07:05\\nyou said it's hard to find the words it is we  don't really know what question we're asking   But that rough picture that there could be a a  theory of a quantum theory somehow this network  \\n1:07:18\\nof cubits that gives rise to geometry space time  is accepted broadly right so we but when you try  \\n1:07:30\\nto get into the detail of it it's only been fully  realized for a very specific model which is kind  \\n1:07:36\\nof a toy model it's not our universe so it  could be that our universe does not admit   that description could be could be that but it's  certainly beyond us the moment technically but  \\n1:07:46\\nit's a wonderful thought and actually there's a  paper uh recently that so people are beginning to  \\n1:07:53\\nuse the the Google chip the Willow chip um which  is a a very powerful it's not a quantum computer  \\nImpacts on quantum computers\\n1:08:00\\nit's a protoquantum computer kind of thing so and  people have started to use it because what it is  \\n1:08:07\\nis a load of cubits that you can entangle and  you can set it up and it's very well controlled  \\n1:08:13\\nso whilst we don't know how to do quantum  calculations on the thing really what you can   do is try to say well could I set them up so that  it's like space emerges from them and there was a  \\n1:08:26\\npaper recently where something that was described  in the paper as a one-dimensional wormhole was  \\n1:08:34\\nmade it wouldn't be in our universe this thing  it would be but it kind of emerged from this  \\n1:08:40\\nstructure and that's the kind of picture we're  trying to get who it's a it's a good paper it's  \\n1:08:45\\nbeen peer- reviewviewed it's a controversial paper  you'll see loads of stuff online but it's worth   looking at those papers and by the time this is  uh sent out there might be some other paper a lot  \\n1:08:54\\nof people are working on it so and also actually  building little clocks little quantum clocks tiny  \\n1:09:01\\nclocks and because we don't even know what a clock  is right at the most fundamental level because we   don't know what time is so so we we're talking  about very fundamental questions about reality  \\n1:09:12\\nin this research but it all came from these  that right which is how cool is that it came  \\n1:09:18\\nfrom thinking about those things it's so cool and  thank you for taking that question so seriously  \\n1:09:24\\nit's a great question no it's and I I think it's  really instructive that um neither of us because  \\n1:09:32\\nnobody has the language when you get into the  real detail you're talking about mathematics  \\n1:09:39\\nultimately um and even the mathematics is not  complete so we're talking about research at the  \\n1:09:46\\ncutting edge and it takes a long time i mean even  quantum mechan you think about quantum mechanics  \\n1:09:52\\nif we were talking about quantum mechanics this is  a hundredy old theory that's very well tested and  \\n1:09:57\\nvery well understood but when you try to put  it into language to speak about it it's much  \\n1:10:02\\neasier to write down the equations or something  I mean even Feinman says that in the fman lectures  \\nWhy study black holes?\\n1:10:08\\nwhen he talking about this thing called the double  slit experiment it's a great description of the   way quantum mechanics behaves but ultimately fman  says you know mathematically it's easy this I can  \\n1:10:19\\nwrite down a a one line which tells you how this  interference works and all those things but then  \\n1:10:24\\nif you try to say well what does it mean what  happens what does it mean for our picture of   reality then we're still arguing about that now  but the maths is easy this is even worse because  \\n1:10:34\\nhere the maths is really difficult and we have  no idea what it's telling us really about reality  \\n1:10:42\\none of the things that I really admire about  you and your work is that you have this sense  \\n1:10:48\\nof wonder at the universe and I think that the  thing I've most appreciated about it and I'm  \\n1:10:55\\nsure I speak for a lot of people is that you give  that sense of wonder back to people you say \\\"Hey  \\n1:11:02\\ndon't you remember what it was like when you were  a little kid looking up at the sky?\\\" And actually   in fact as you learn more about the universe that  sense of wonder can increase not decrease and I  \\n1:11:12\\nthink that's really special and I think that  people need that and first I just wanted to say   thank you oh thank you and second my last question  for you is how do you feel when you go outside  \\n1:11:27\\nand look up at the night sky given what you know  oh it's a wonderful question and um you kind of  \\n1:11:35\\nalluded to it earlier that um the the the sense of  awe and the sense of mystery and beauty increases  \\n1:11:47\\nthe more you know about what you're looking at it  doesn't decrease the mysteries the the number of  \\n1:11:53\\nmysteries increases the more you look at it and  it is incomprehensible even if you think about  \\n1:12:00\\nthe Milky Way so it's a beautiful thing to look  at so anybody watching this if it's a clear night  \\n1:12:05\\nand you're away from the city lights you can go  we've all looked at the Milky Way at some point  \\n1:12:11\\nif even that if you try and picture what it is and  you learn that it's a galaxy of what 200 billion  \\n1:12:20\\nmaybe 400 billion suns what does that mean 200  billion suns most of them have planets so it'll  \\n1:12:28\\nbe trillions of planets takes light 100,000 years  to cross that thing none of that is is I think you  \\n1:12:37\\nyou can't internalize even that and that's kind of  a simple thing cuz it's just a galaxy and we know  \\n1:12:44\\nabout galaxies and then you talk about as we've  talked about the center of that galaxy lies this  \\n1:12:50\\nthing the super massive black hole and then we  don't know we we don't know what that thing is  \\n1:12:56\\nyou can look towards it so you can look towards  Sagittarius espec the further south you are the  \\n1:13:02\\neasier it'll be to look at but you can look in  the direction of the center of the galaxy so you  \\n1:13:08\\ncan go out if you if you're not too far north and  look at that right you can look at it with your  \\n1:13:14\\neyes and um yeah and wonder about it so that's  what I I really believe i know Richard Feinman said  \\n1:13:23\\nit many years ago many other people have said it  but the more you understand about nature the more  \\n1:13:29\\nmysterious and magical it becomes it's a beautiful  place then thank you so much for your time\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n

I mean, this is the central question.\\n\\nBrian Cox: The laws of nature are quite clear on this. So that's what bothered everybody for a very long time. What happened? What's the end of the story?\\n\\nCleo Abram: So what happens\u2014I'm so excited about this. The video you're about to watch is a deep dive into the cutting-edge research happening right now about black holes. It's awesome. It's the extended cut of an interview that I did with famous physicist Dr. Brian Cox for a shorter Huge If True episode all about what would actually happen if you fell into a black hole. That episode is incredible and I've linked to it in the description, but there was so much weird and mind-bending stuff in this conversation that didn't fit into that shorter episode, and I knew that you'd want to see it, so we decided to release the full extended cut. It's just too cool and I think you'll love it, so strap in because the cutting edge of black holes is wild.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Great, would you mind just starting us out by introducing yourself however you like.\\n\\nBrian Cox: Yeah, so I'm Brian Cox, and if you want the full title, I'm Professor of Particle Physics at the University of Manchester, Royal Society Professor for Public Engagement in Science, and Visiting Scholar at the Crick Institute in London.\\n\\nCleo Abram: And how do you describe what you do every day?\\n\\nBrian Cox: What I do every day: physics. That's the way I see myself. If someone asks me what I do, I say I'm a physicist. But actually, of course, most of my time now is spent on the public engagement side, and I kind of fell into that accidentally. Still, maybe there's some deep psychological thing going on, but I never say TV presenter or whatever it is\u2014I just say physicist.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Well, that's what I want to talk to you all about today. Imagine that you and I are on a mission to fall into a black hole, and we have some imaginary spaceship that can take us as far and as fast as we want. So we get up, we walk outside, we get into our spaceship. What now? What is a black hole, and how do we find them?\\n\\nPlease confirm if you'd like me to proceed to the next section: \u201cFoundations of black holes: Einstein\u2019s spacetime, Schwarzschild, collapse, and horizons.\u201d\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"role\": \"user\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"input_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"Please proceed.\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"msg_68a93392bd408190b566538441377ede0ae799c1ac6f1fbf\",\r\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"output_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"### Foundations of black holes: Einstein\u2019s spacetime, Schwarzschild, collapse, and horizons\\n\\nBrian Cox: So a black hole\u2014it's interesting that the idea or the first glimpse of them theoretically came very shortly after Einstein's theory of gravity was published in 1915, although it wasn't recognized as such at the time. Essentially, what does Einstein's theory do? It's important for what follows. It's a theory of space and time, and how spacetime\u2014often described as the fabric of the universe\u2014responds, warps, or curves to matter and energy in the universe. The equations basically say: give me some distribution of matter, something like a ball of matter, and the equations will tell you how the fabric of the universe is distorted. By the way, the force of gravity in that theory is the response of everything else in the universe to that distortion. So Newton would say it's a force between us and the Earth, but Einstein would say there isn't a force; what we're responding to is the distortion in the fabric of the universe created by the Earth. John Wheeler, the great physicist, put it beautifully: matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move. That's Einstein's theory.\\n\\nBrian Cox: In 1916, shortly after it was published, a man called Karl Schwarzschild remarkably managed to solve the equations for a perfectly spherical, non-spinning ball of matter\u2014it's the simplest thing you could do\u2014which tells you how space and time are distorted by it. That's a model for a star. He solved the equations, and in those equations there is a description of a black hole, although it wasn't realized at the time. It's a remarkable, simple piece of mathematics. One way to think about the idea behind a black hole is to ask: could you remove the star from this fabric but leave the distortion behind? If you do that, you get the description of a black hole. You might say, how can that be formed in nature? So think about what a star is. A star is a balancing act. It's mainly hydrogen and helium collapsing under its own gravity\u2014that's how our Sun formed four and a half billion years ago. As it collapses, the core heats up, and that initiates nuclear fusion reactions in the core. In the case of our Sun, it's hydrogen being fused into helium. That releases energy, which creates a pressure that holds the thing up. It's a balance, but it needs fuel, and it's not infinitely big. At some point it runs out of nuclear fuel, and ultimately no more fusion reactions can occur in any star, and so the star will resume its collapse.\\n\\nBrian Cox: The question is: is there something that stops it? Because if there isn't something that stops the collapse, then it will collapse without limit. If you look at the history of physics in the 1920s and 30s, people were saying, we'd like to avoid this idea that the thing will collapse without limit, because if it does then Schwarzschild's equation predicts some very strange things indeed. People tried to avoid it. It was really Oppenheimer and his student Snyder in the late 1930s, just before the Second World War, who showed that with some assumptions it looks like a massive enough star could actually collapse without limit.\\n\\nBrian Cox: What does that mean, collapses without limit? Essentially it does what I said: you remove the star from the fabric of the universe, leaving the distortion behind. The idea behind the black hole is: take the Sun, a star the mass of the Sun, and collapse it. You keep on collapsing it. You get to a point when the radius of the Sun is not 700,000 kilometers, which is what it is\u2014about half a million miles\u2014but you squash it down until its radius becomes 3 kilometers. There are several ways to look at this. One is that on the surface, the speed you'd have to travel to escape its gravitational pull\u2014the escape velocity\u2014would exceed the speed of light. So even light rays emitted from the surface, if you could squash it down that far, would just stay there. They would not escape, because they'd be trying to go at the speed of light and the escape velocity is the speed of light.\\n\\nBrian Cox: What happens if a star collapses inside that number, which for the mass of the Sun\u20143 kilometers\u2014is called the Schwarzschild radius? Then it will collapse without limit. Nothing will stop it, and all you will get is essentially the geometry of space and time, the curvature. That's a black hole. It's a thing that traps light in that sense. If you have this surface and space and time are so distorted there that if you go across that surface\u2014it's called the event horizon of the black hole\u2014then you can't get out.\\n\\nPlease confirm if you\u2019d like me to proceed to the next section: \u201cObserving and sizing black holes: Sagittarius A*, lensing, mass scales, and stellar remnants.\u201d\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"role\": \"user\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"input_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"Please proceed.\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"msg_68a933f0c74c8190825e90d8f8851f510ae799c1ac6f1fbf\",\r\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"output_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"### Observing and sizing black holes: Sagittarius A*, lensing, mass scales, and stellar remnants\\n\\nCleo Abram: I want to take that step by step to understand it. In order to understand this, let's imagine that we choose the black hole at the center of our own galaxy\u2014Sagittarius A*. I know that we took this picture of it with the Event Horizon Telescope. What are we looking at here?\\n\\nBrian Cox: The light in this picture is not from the black hole, because we've just said black holes trap light. It's from what's called the accretion disk around the black hole. You should imagine material spiraling in orbit around this very dense object, violently orbiting so it heats up and emits light. Picture a flat, thin disk of material around the black hole. But this does not look like that. What you're seeing is the distortion\u2014the curvature\u2014of the light rays. You might think light travels in straight lines, but Einstein's theory says that in the vicinity of this thing the fabric of the universe itself is distorted, so the paths of the light rays follow the distortion. That's why, in an animation, it looks like it's going over the top and around the sides at the same time.\\n\\nBrian Cox: Think of this famous image of a black hole. If you think of the film Interstellar, that code was an implementation of Einstein's equations\u2014Kip Thorne and others helped them do that\u2014so it's really a prediction. Imagine this disk of material around this thing. Light rays from behind the black hole, from the disk, go around into your eyes. Sometimes they orbit and then go around into your eyes. They reach your eyes from every point on the disk\u2014from underneath and at the top and behind\u2014so you have light rays going all ways around this thing. That's what you see as an image. It's a prediction of Einstein's theory that a real black hole should look like that\u2014this characteristic donut shape. Here's an image with radio telescopes of such a thing, and it looks like the prediction. It is a bit blurry, but this is at the center of the galaxy\u2014very difficult. This was actually the second one that was imaged. The first one was in a galaxy called M87, which is 55 million light-years away and is bigger than this one.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Our black hole\u2014how big is it compared to other black holes that we know exist?\\n\\nBrian Cox: It's a smallish one\u2014well, it's a supermassive black hole, but compared to some others it's on the smaller side. We think that, to a good approximation, all galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers. We don't quite know why, actually. We don't quite know how galaxies form in the early universe. It's one of the things that the James Webb Space Telescope is looking at in some detail. They can be different masses. As I said, the M87 galaxy has one that's about 6 billion times the mass of the Sun, rather than about 6 million times the mass of the Sun for this one.\\n\\nBrian Cox: How big is it? The number I always remember in my mind is the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun, which is the radius you'd have to squash the Sun down to in order to make a black hole, and it's 3 kilometers. It goes like the mass, so you can work it out. If Sagittarius A* is about 6 million times the mass of the Sun, then the Schwarzschild radius is 6 million times 3 kilometers. That gives you an idea of the size of the structure. The disk outside it is much bigger.\\n\\nCleo Abram: I did the math with Earth's radius, and it seemed to suggest that we would become a black hole if we compressed everything on Earth\u2014and all of us\u2014into something about the size of a pea.\\n\\nBrian Cox: From memory it's about 0.8 centimeters, just less than a centimeter, so you're right\u2014about that big.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Do black holes that small exist?\\n\\nBrian Cox: No, we don't think so. Even black holes the mass of the Sun\u2014the Sun will not form a black hole when it runs out of nuclear fuel. It will collapse, and there's something that can stop it collapsing: the force associated with electrons. It's called a white dwarf star. It's a beautiful calculation. What stops it, as an aside, is the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons don't want to be too close together, roughly speaking. As you squash the thing, the electrons get closer together, so they separate away from each other and go into smaller and smaller regions of space because they're trying to stay away from each other. But there's also Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. As you confine them into smaller regions, they start jiggling around faster and faster. Ultimately you reach a limit where they're essentially trying to jiggle at the speed of light\u2014and they can't\u2014so there's a limit to how much pressure that process can exert. It turns out it's 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, which is called the Chandrasekhar limit.\\n\\nBrian Cox: You can do that calculation without knowing that stars exist. All you need to know is quantum mechanics and relativity, and you can work out the biggest lump of stuff that can be held up by this jiggling of electrons. It turns out it's 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. Then you look into the sky and you see there are these things called white dwarfs\u2014collapsed stars\u2014and there's none more massive than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. Then you can get neutron stars, which are held up by the jiggling of neutrons. Ultimately, if you go to something that's three times the mass of the Sun\u2014something like that, a bit more\u2014then nothing stops it collapsing, and that's when you form a black hole. The lightest black holes that we know of are around that mass, and then we know of ones that are 10, 20, 30 times the mass of the Sun from collapsed stars, and then these things which are millions of times\u2014or even more\u2014the mass of the Sun, which are at the hearts of galaxies.\\n\\nPlease confirm if you'd like me to proceed to the next section: \u201cFalling in: free fall, event horizons, spaghettification, and time dilation.\u201d\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"role\": \"user\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"input_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"Please proceed.\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"msg_68a93433c2748190a961912677be0ec20ae799c1ac6f1fbf\",\r\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"output_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"### Falling in: free fall, event horizons, spaghettification, and time dilation\\n\\nCleo Abram: We've launched in our spaceship and we are hurtling toward this black hole. Could you walk us through, step by step, what happens from now until when we hit the event horizon?\\n\\nBrian Cox: The first thing to say is that right at the heart of Einstein's theory is something called the equivalence principle, which was the idea that really led Einstein to the theory of gravity itself. You don't feel its pull. You just fall freely toward it. So we're falling toward this thing now and we turn our rocket motors off. If we can't look outside\u2014if we can't look out the windows\u2014we're just in free fall; we're just floating. It's fundamental to Einstein's theory. It's very important for the problems that follow that we're going to talk about that you just freely fall toward this thing.\\n\\nBrian Cox: We could be approaching this in this room now and we would have no clue that that's what's happening. In fact, if we're approaching the event horizon of a very big black hole like this\u2014of a black hole of this mass\u2014then we wouldn't even notice anything, according to Einstein's theory, as we fall across the horizon into the interior of the black hole. We would fall across the horizon from our perspective, in this room, into the interior of the black hole and we would notice nothing.\\n\\nCleo Abram: What about when we're in the accretion disk? Wouldn't we be banged around by a lot of stuff?\\n\\nBrian Cox: We might get in a bit of a mess as we pass through the accretion disk, but we're talking about the pure gravitational thing. You're absolutely right: it's a bit nasty around these things. But that's nothing to do with the black hole itself\u2014it's nothing to do with the fundamental physics. It's all the X-rays and all this nasty gamma radiation, all the stuff that's being radiated from all this hot material around it. That would be a problem. But if we had\u2014let's say\u2014our room, this spacecraft, magically insulated from radiation and heat and all those things, then nothing. We would go into the interior.\\n\\nBrian Cox: There is a caveat. It matters that the description I've given is for a supermassive black hole. If this were a smaller black hole\u2014less massive, a few times the mass of the Sun\u2014then at some point you experience what's called tidal gravity, tidal forces. Those are the things that raise the tides in the oceans of the Earth. In our freely falling trajectory toward the black hole, at some point you start to feel the tides. You start to get stretched and squashed, and you will feel it. Eventually you'll really feel it, because formally, as you get very close to the singularity, you get infinitely stretched and squashed.\\n\\nCleo Abram: I want to talk about that\u2014spaghettification. That's my favorite. But for a smaller black hole, as you approach the horizon you feel those forces, whereas for the big ones you don't feel the tides until you've gone into the interior.\\n\\nCleo Abram: We're moving toward the event horizon. We're somehow insulated from the messiness of the accretion disk. We're moving toward it. I've heard that there's a moment where the physics are such that if you and I are actually falling in, if we look to the left and the right we would actually see the back of our own heads. Is that anywhere close to correct? And can you tell me about the other little details as we approach the event horizon that you think are important?\\n\\nBrian Cox: One of the biggest details\u2014it's not even a detail, it's one of the most shocking things about this\u2014is that I've described us falling into the black hole, in this room where we can't see out. What do we feel? What can we measure? The answer is: you can't measure anything, and we don't feel anything until we get inside and approach the singularity for this one. But from the point of view of someone outside, the description is very different. What would they see happening to us as we fall toward this thing? Even in Einstein's theory, with nothing else\u2014no quantum mechanics\u2014what they would see is time tick more slowly for us. They would start to see, as we approached the black hole\u2014if they could see our watches, if we were transmitting to them, transmitting from these cameras\u2014they would see our time tick more slowly, more slowly, more slowly, and they would see our time stop on the horizon. They would never see us fall in. From the point of view of someone outside, nothing goes into the black hole\u2014ever.\\n\\nCleo Abram: So what do they see? Us imprinted there forever? Or does the light from us slowly fade?\\n\\nBrian Cox: It would fade, because the light is climbing away through this gravitational field, so it's getting stretched. We get redder and redder and redder\u2014redshifted, infinitely redshifted. Time passes more and more slowly until it stops on the horizon when viewed from the outside. From our perspective, we look at our watches and they go one second per second, and that's absolutely central. According to Einstein, there's nothing weird there. It's pure Einstein's theory. That's the first thing to say, and it's a clue to the interesting things about what follows: there are different perspectives on what's happening here. From our point of view, we're going in\u2014for a big black hole. From the point of view of someone outside, we never go in.\\n\\nCleo Abram: So at this moment we cross the event horizon and we don't feel it. We could have crossed it just now and wouldn\u2019t notice. Our experience now is completely inside the blackness of the black hole. From an outsider's perspective, though\u2026\\n\\nBrian Cox: \u2026from their perspective, our time has stopped on the horizon. But for us, we carry on. Gravity is increasing faster and faster as we head inward, and this is where we get to spaghettification.\\n\\nCleo Abram: My understanding is that when the gravity at your feet is so different from the gravity at your head, you begin to stretch in a very dramatic way. This is spaghettification. Could you explain what's happening here?\\n\\nBrian Cox: One way of thinking about it is that the distortion in spacetime is not constant over the length of your body. When we're falling in, we might as well be in flat space\u2014this is the equivalence principle in action\u2014because over small regions you don't notice curvature. It's like saying that on the surface of the Earth, if you look at a square mile, you don't see the curvature; you have to go to bigger distances to see that you're on a curved surface. So you don't feel the difference in gravitational pull until it becomes very distorted when you get very close to this thing. Then you start to see it. Tidal gravity works to squash in one direction and pull in the other. So you start to feel this strange sensation of being stretched and squashed. As you go closer and closer to the singularity, those effects become much more extreme, until they're so extreme that first of all you cease to stay together as a coherent object. Are we one long string of atoms? The atoms get separated. Then the protons\u2014the quarks inside the protons\u2014get separated. Ultimately, according to Einstein's theory, the tidal forces become infinite\u2014formally infinite\u2014so everything has gone. Everything has been ripped apart. This is what we call the singularity.\\n\\nBrian Cox: You asked about time dilation more broadly. You actually see this effect on Earth. Time ticks at a different rate\u2014by which I mean clocks tick at a different rate\u2014in orbit than on the surface of the Earth. It's the same effect. The drift is tens of thousands of nanoseconds per day, the difference in the rate that time passes at the orbit of a GPS satellite and on the ground, and we have to accommodate that or it doesn't work. So the question with a black hole is: if I keep the mass the same but shrink it down\u2014how does that distortion change as I go closer and closer to this immensely massive, compact thing? From the perspective of someone outside, time keeps going more and more slowly until you see it stop on the horizon. It's not that this behavior of time is unique to a black hole; it's just that in the black hole it becomes extreme because the thing has completely collapsed.\\n\\nPlease confirm if you'd like me to proceed to the next section: \u201cHawking radiation and the information paradox: evaporation, Page time, and modern advances.\u201d\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"role\": \"user\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"input_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"Please proceed.\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"msg_68a93471a6048190b4e4ad1ef44223d80ae799c1ac6f1fbf\",\r\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"output_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"### Hawking radiation and the information paradox: evaporation, Page time, and modern advances\\n\\nCleo Abram: We have passed through the event horizon, we have been spaghettified, we have hit the end of time. This is a question I think I know the answer to, but I think it leads us into our next section. Can we ever get back out?\\n\\nBrian Cox: According to Einstein's theory, no, because you've gone to the end of time. There's no way. It's all over. You've been ripped to bits. Everything has gone to this infinitely distorted space and time and it's done.\\n\\nCleo Abram: What would Stephen Hawking say?\\n\\nBrian Cox: Stephen Hawking, in the 1970s, discovered that black holes ain't so black. We've said nothing comes out of a black hole\u2014everything that goes in goes to the singularity, it's gone forever, and the black hole lives forever. Hawking calculated that if you do some quantum mechanics around the horizon of the black hole, then empty space\u2014which in quantum mechanics has a rich structure\u2014gets disrupted by the strange behavior of space and time. The result is that particles\u2014photons essentially, what's called Hawking radiation\u2014are emitted from the black hole.\\n\\nBrian Cox: There are different ways of thinking about what's happening. Hawking gave an analogy in his paper, and he said it's just an analogy. People get very worked up online when you talk about it, but Hawking did write it down. A way to picture the quantum vacuum is to imagine particles coming in and out of existence all the time, in accord with the uncertainty principle. In the vicinity of the horizon, this structure gets disrupted. You could have the situation where one of these particles is on the inside and one is on the outside. We know what's happening to the one on the inside: it's going to the singularity. The other one is made real and escapes. That's a picture that Hawking himself gave. The upshot is accurate: a particle has been shaken out of the vacuum and is now a real particle when viewed from the outside, and it goes away. The black hole is glowing; it has a temperature. That means it's losing energy, and so it has a lifetime. Over time\u2014enormous times, far greater than the current age of the universe for any black hole we know of, because we don't know of tiny ones\u2014the black hole evaporates. For these supermassive ones we\u2019re talking about lifetimes in excess of 10^100 years. Ultimately it will be gone, and space will be all nice and normal again. All you will have left will be the Hawking radiation that's been emitted over these eons of time.\\n\\nCleo Abram: I think something is missing from my understanding of the universe. All of this matter, including us, has passed through the event horizon and ended up at the singularity. It is something in there at the end of time. And I also think I know that every law we have about the universe says that information is conserved. If a black hole will one day end up as nothing\u2014the normal vacuum of space\u2014what happened to you and me? What happened to all of that stuff?\\n\\nBrian Cox: This is the central question. Hawking's initial calculation in 1974 was that this radiation, the Hawking radiation, is informationless. It's information-free\u2014purely thermal. That's not surprising if you think about it, because it's been shaken out of the vacuum of space. You would think it's got nothing to do with the stuff that falls in. It's something to do with the horizon, not the singularity. Out it comes, and the calculation is very clear. That would suggest that the information, any record of anything that fell in, has been erased. The energy is conserved: the black hole hasn't vanished, it's turned into radiation. But the radiation contains no trace of anything that fell in.\\n\\nBrian Cox: That is weird. You might say, what's the difference? If I get this piece of paper and set fire to it, it goes and there's just ashes and radiation. Yes, but in principle, if you could measure everything\u2014though you can't\u2014you could reconstruct the information on the page. What's happening when you burn it is chemical reactions, oxidation, and so on. You can trace everything back. All the atoms and things are still around. In a black hole, you can't. So it wasn't surprising that there was a problem. What was surprising is that there appeared to be a calculation that tells you black holes erase everything. As you said, the laws of nature are quite clear on this: information does not get destroyed in the universe. It gets scrambled so you can never reconstruct it, but it doesn't get destroyed. That's what bothered everybody for a very long time.\\n\\nBrian Cox: The end of the story\u2014we're not at the end, but in 2019 a series of papers were published, one by Jeff Pennington and another by a different group of authors, suggesting that Hawking missed a bit in his calculation. Very subtle\u2014he could never have seen it. That's why it took 50 years to see what he'd missed. It turns out that the radiation is not information-free. At the end of the process, all the information about everything that fell in is imprinted in the radiation, as you would normally expect.\\n\\nBrian Cox: Then it becomes interesting, because you say, what's the picture? I understand that if I take this and throw it into the black hole, it's gone across the horizon and gone to the singularity. It's definitely true that nothing comes out of the black hole. So how is the information about this thing getting imprinted in the radiation? Initially, quite a few people thought it must be just right at the end, when it's all quantum gravity and weird stuff\u2014so the thing's just about to disappear back into the universe, it's getting hotter and hotter as it gets smaller, more and more violent, and something weird happens and everything comes out. But it was known for a long time\u2014there's work by a great physicist called Don Page\u2014that the problems about the information and the structure of space occur about halfway through the black hole's life. It's called the Page time. The problems occur way before you should be thinking about quantum gravity and a load of weird stuff. There was a big challenge to physics: we should be able to calculate stuff when the black hole is halfway through its life. There's nothing weird at the horizon, but yet something weird appears to be happening. The picture of the thing is breaking down.\\n\\nBrian Cox: So what is the picture of this? I should emphasize the health warning: this is ongoing research and there is no agreed-upon picture, and there are some other subtleties we'll talk about in a minute. But a picture of what's happening is related to something called the holographic principle, at some level we think.\\n\\nPlease confirm if you'd like me to proceed to the next section: \u201cEntropy, holography, and complementarity: area law, hot horizons, ER = EPR, and dual perspectives.\u201d\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"role\": \"user\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"input_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"Please proceed.\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"msg_68a934d6a4888190a03600724710d4c40ae799c1ac6f1fbf\",\r\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"output_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"### Entropy, holography, and complementarity: area law, hot horizons, ER = EPR, and dual perspectives\\n\\nBrian Cox: So there was another discovery made in the 1970s that\u2019s very interesting. Jacob Bekenstein, one of the pioneers along with Stephen Hawking, calculated the entropy of a black hole. Hawking had calculated the temperature\u2014his equation for the temperature of a black hole is inscribed on his gravestone in Westminster Abbey. Temperature, which we now understand as the average motion of the component parts of a system, is familiar for things made of stuff\u2014heat up water and the molecules jiggle faster. But a black hole is just geometry. It\u2019s space and time. So immediately we have the temperature of a geometry, not of a thing made of stuff. That\u2019s interesting. Then Bekenstein calculated that the entropy\u2014the measure of hidden information\u2014of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of its event horizon, measured in square Planck lengths. It\u2019s a remarkable idea. You can think of the horizon, from the outside point of view, as having information encoded on it in pixels one Planck length across. And that\u2019s weird, because if I ask how much information is contained in this room, you might say it\u2019s to do with the volume\u2014the number of books in a library. This says no: at a fundamental level, the amount of information is determined by the surface area, not the volume. It\u2019s almost as if nature says you can paper the outside of the library with the pages of the book. You start to get hints that there\u2019s something very strange going on.\\n\\nBrian Cox: There\u2019s another property that follows, and it\u2019s why I was careful about saying that from our perspective nothing happens when we fall in. Hawking radiation comes from the disruption of the vacuum, in one picture. From the point of view of someone outside, if you lowered a thermometer down toward the horizon on a kind of fishing line, it would read hotter and hotter temperatures as you approach the horizon. From the point of view of someone falling in, there\u2019s no temperature at all. You don\u2019t see anything, you don\u2019t feel anything; you don\u2019t measure any Hawking radiation. You just go in because you\u2019re in free fall. So from the outside, the description of what happens to us is different. We get vaporized before we cross the horizon, and all our \u201cashes\u201d\u2014our information\u2014come out in the radiation. You could collect it, and you\u2019d say: great, it\u2019s just like burning a piece of paper. But Einstein\u2019s theory is clear that from our perspective, we go in and get spaghettified. From our perspective, our demise is spaghettification; from the exterior perspective, our demise is incineration. Which one is it?\\n\\nBrian Cox: The modern view, much debated and going back to work by Leonard Susskind, Gerard \u2019t Hooft, and others, is called black hole complementarity. The idea is that both pictures are correct from different points of view. That\u2019s relativity in action. You might say, okay, I sort of understand the idea that from the outside things fall in and get scrambled up and are somehow stored near the horizon, and you can imagine those bits of information coming off as Hawking radiation. Nothing really goes in, so it\u2019s fine\u2014you understand how the stuff got out. Then you ask: what\u2019s the description from our perspective going in? We definitely went in. What happens? Are there two of us?\\n\\nCleo Abram: Are there two of us? Do we get copied?\\n\\nBrian Cox: That\u2019s a great question. You might say we get copied\u2014Susskind called it a quantum Xerox machine. But there\u2019s a very fundamental theorem in quantum mechanics, the no-cloning theorem, which says you can\u2019t copy an arbitrary quantum state. You can\u2019t copy the information. So it\u2019s not copied. What\u2019s the description, then? This is where we get speculative, and we\u2019re trying to understand what the mathematics is saying. One description from our perspective is: yes, we go to the singularity and get scrambled, and then it looks like the interior of the black hole is, in some sense, the same place as the exterior. You could almost picture wormholes opening up from the interior to the exterior\u2014very naively, you can imagine bits of information going through those wormholes and coming out again. Is that really what\u2019s happening?\\n\\nBrian Cox: There\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been around for a long time, due to Susskind and others, called ER = EPR. ER is Einstein\u2013Rosen, the wormhole that Einstein and Rosen noticed appears in the Schwarzschild description; EPR is Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen, their very famous paper about quantum entanglement. In an entangled system, you can have two \u201cquantum coins,\u201d say, in a state that\u2019s heads\u2013tails plus tails\u2013heads. Separate them by a large distance and the state is still that entangled state. When you measure one and get heads, you know the other is tails, even if it\u2019s a light-year away. That bothered Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. The ER = EPR idea is that you can picture quantum entanglement as a kind of wormhole linking the two things. It\u2019s a way of visualizing the connection. The picture of a black hole becomes similar: we\u2019re developing this idea where the interior, from one perspective, is the exterior from another perspective. What you\u2019re getting there, we think, are glimpses of the holographic principle at work\u2014dual descriptions of the same physics from different vantage points. Ultimately, in both descriptions, the information comes out. But the way it comes out is radically different depending on your point of view.\\n\\nPlease confirm if you\u2019d like me to proceed to the next section: \u201cEmergent spacetime and quantum information: AdS/CFT, qubits, and experimental hints.\u201d\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"role\": \"user\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"input_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"Please proceed.\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"msg_68a9385c8690819084b4390f988522fa0ae799c1ac6f1fbf\",\r\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"output_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"### Emergent spacetime and quantum information: AdS/CFT, qubits, and experimental hints\\n\\nBrian Cox: There\u2019s a very famous paper by Maldacena called the AdS/CFT conjecture. I think I\u2019m right in saying it\u2019s the most cited paper in all of theoretical physics. It was a very particular model of quantum mechanics on a surface\u2014that\u2019s what CFT, conformal field theory, means\u2014and a precise proof that there\u2019s a dual description, that this quantum theory describes an interior geometry of space which was not there in the surface theory. The space is called an AdS space\u2014anti\u2013de Sitter space, or whatever\u2014but it\u2019s a proof that there\u2019s a one-to-one description between these two things. I think it\u2019s fair to say that these strange apparent paradoxes with black holes are telling us that our universe can be described in such a way. There are different ways of describing the same physics, and they\u2019re radically different ways. Ultimately it shouldn\u2019t be so problematic in that in both descriptions the information comes out, but the way it came out is radically different depending on your point of view.\\n\\nBrian Cox: They\u2019re called holographic because you can ask what it means to have a complete description of a higher-dimensional thing. Let\u2019s be very concrete: this room. Let\u2019s say this principle is correct for this room. We have a surface surrounding the room\u2014the walls\u2014and there\u2019s a theory that lives just there and fully describes everything that\u2019s in the room. In that sense we\u2019re holograms, because we\u2019re described by a theory that lives on a surface. A hologram is a piece of film, and a perfect hologram would have a perfect three-dimensional image encoded in the two-dimensional surface. That really is the picture we\u2019re talking about here. You can see it with the event horizon and all the information on the outside, and you ask: is the interior there and what happens? It looks like we\u2019re flipping between descriptions of the world.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Does it feel sometimes like that story about a one-dimensional being meeting a two-dimensional being, and then a two-dimensional being meeting a three-dimensional being, and that we are somehow seeing the weirdness of our own experience of dimensionality? If someone were viewing us from a higher dimension, they would see this more clearly. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m asking.\\n\\nBrian Cox: I know what you\u2019re getting at. What we seem to be struggling with is almost the same struggle as a two-dimensional being trying to understand a three-dimensional world, or actually, as three-dimensional beings trying to understand the four-dimensional world of relativity. We struggle with it. It\u2019s hard for us. One description I saw of why we are glimpsing this deeper structure of nature when we think about black holes\u2014which are real things\u2014was that it\u2019s almost as if this thing slices through space and leaves the building blocks of space dangling right at the horizon. Gravity has created a situation where you come face to face with the structure of space and time. In retrospect the hints were there: temperature and entropy, and information encoded in space. It looks like we\u2019re starting to glimpse a theory of the underlying structure of space and time.\\n\\nBrian Cox: This goes by the name of emergent spacetime. The picture would be that you have a description that looks, for all the world, like a network of qubits\u2014which is what a quantum computer is. It looks like there\u2019s a description of the universe that doesn\u2019t have space and time in it, but is just a network; it\u2019s just information. That goes all the way back to John Wheeler\u2014the great physicist\u2014who called it \u201cit from bit.\u201d \u201cIt\u201d is this, and \u201cbit\u201d is information. That\u2019s what it looks like we\u2019re seeing. Our window onto this deeper theory\u2014call it quantum gravity if you like\u2014has been very simple questions about black holes, which are real things. That\u2019s why Hawking\u2019s calculation is so important: it\u2019s the first precise glimpse of a problem with our picture of the world. It\u2019s a precise question: does this thing destroy information or not? If it doesn\u2019t, how does the information get out? It\u2019s a simple question that has led\u2014and is still leading\u2014to all these developments. You would get different pictures from any expert who does the calculations. They would not be certain about the physical picture, I think it\u2019s fair to say.\\n\\nCleo Abram: So is it fair to say that the specific research into black holes, the specific questions we\u2019re asking about black holes, are helping us unlock much deeper questions about the universe as a whole?\\n\\nBrian Cox: Exactly. It\u2019s wonderful. One of the wonderful things is that the techniques you develop as a PhD student or a postdoc\u2014or someone working in this area\u2014to try to understand what the black hole is doing are the same techniques you need if you want to understand how quantum computers work. That\u2019s a real engineering question as well as a fundamental physics question. We\u2019re trying to build these things. We haven\u2019t built one that works in the way we want yet, but obviously Google and Microsoft and IBM and others are pouring a lot of money into it because they\u2019re profoundly powerful devices. A lot of insight now into how they might work and how we might build them is coming from this field of emergent spacetime. It\u2019s the best example I know of. If you say to a funding agency, \u201cI want money to work on black holes,\u201d they might ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use? Does anybody care?\u201d The lesson is that when you study nature and go to things that pose profound questions about our understanding of physics, you are likely to learn something useful, because you\u2019re studying reality. This is the best example I know, because you\u2019re studying completely collapsed stars or the things at the hearts of galaxies, and you\u2019re gaining insight into quantum computers and networks of qubits and quantum information. It\u2019s the most wonderful thing.\\n\\nBrian Cox: People are beginning to use the Google chip\u2014the Willow chip\u2014which is a very powerful proto\u2013quantum computer. What it is, is a load of qubits that you can entangle. You can set it up and it\u2019s very well controlled. While we don\u2019t know how to do quantum calculations on the thing in the way we\u2019d like, what you can do is try to set them up so that it\u2019s like space emerges from them. There was a paper recently where something described as a one-dimensional wormhole was made. It wouldn\u2019t be in our universe, but it kind of emerged from this structure. That\u2019s the kind of picture we\u2019re trying to get. It\u2019s a good paper; it\u2019s been peer-reviewed. It\u2019s a controversial paper\u2014you\u2019ll see loads of stuff online\u2014but it\u2019s worth looking at those papers, and by the time this is sent out there might be some other paper; a lot of people are working on it. People are also building little clocks\u2014little quantum clocks, tiny clocks\u2014because we don\u2019t even know what a clock is at the most fundamental level, because we don\u2019t know what time is. We\u2019re talking about very fundamental questions about reality in this research, and it all came from those things\u2014black holes\u2014how cool is that?\\n\\nPlease confirm if you\u2019d like me to proceed to the final section: \u201cOpen questions and cosmic context: firewall paradox, Big Bang vs black holes, cosmological horizons, and wonder.\u201d\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"role\": \"user\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"input_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"Please proceed.\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"msg_68a938ae05508190994a30c179a3f6610ae799c1ac6f1fbf\",\r\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"output_text\",\r\n          \"text\": \"### Open questions and cosmic context: firewall paradox, Big Bang vs black holes, cosmological horizons, and wonder\\n\\nBrian Cox: There\u2019s one thing I should mention for a complete picture for people who want to know more: the firewall paradox, as it was initially introduced. It hasn\u2019t been resolved yet. The problem is that when you disrupt space in the way a black hole does, and when you try to understand what\u2019s happening to the information and the entangled particles that are on one side of the horizon and the other\u2014the Hawking radiation we discussed earlier\u2014you bump up against a problem. Maybe this description of the equivalence principle and of us freely falling across the horizon from our perspective into the interior of the black hole doesn\u2019t quite stand up. Maybe you\u2019re getting a challenge to this basis of general relativity. Maybe it\u2019s really true that there isn\u2019t an interior of the black hole. Maybe it\u2019s really true that you don\u2019t go in\u2014there isn\u2019t an \u201cin.\u201d If you search through the literature, you\u2019ll see those papers were big in this debate. Some people thought it was solved; other people thought it wasn\u2019t. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the jury is still out on these issues. The thing to emphasize is that there\u2019s something really fundamental going on here, and it almost certainly is associated with the nature of space and time themselves\u2014spacetime. It\u2019s associated with geometries of spacetime\u2014maybe wormholes, maybe those kinds of things. It\u2019s tremendously interesting. It develops so fast and our understanding is developing so fast. The last thing to say is it does look like there is a description of the universe that looks like a giant quantum computer in some sense, which does not imply that someone built it\u2014it\u2019s not a simulation\u2014but it does suggest that there\u2019s a good description of reality that you can write down in the form of some kind of network of entangled qubits, presumably at the Planck scale\u2014who knows, maybe even that\u2019s not obvious\u2014but something like that.\\n\\nCleo Abram: I came into this story thinking that I was going to tell about falling into a black hole and then eventually get to the cutting edge of research into black holes and that that was going to be the end of the story. But actually what I\u2019m hearing you say now is that the cutting edge of research into black holes is actually a cutting edge of research into the universe itself, and that is just incredibly exciting.\\n\\nBrian Cox: It\u2019s really beautiful, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019re the window\u2014almost like the Rosetta stones that are allowing us to translate between different pictures of the universe.\\n\\nCleo Abram: All right, so that\u2019s probably where we end. If I rewind for a second, one of my questions to connect things that I know about the universe is: what is the relationship we think between the singularity at the center of a black hole and the point that Big Banged?\\n\\nBrian Cox: It\u2019s a very good question. The singularity inside a black hole in Einstein\u2019s theory is the end of time. In Einstein\u2019s theory alone of the evolution of the universe, there is another singularity at the other end of time, which is the Big Bang singularity. You might be tempted to call it the beginning of time. It\u2019s a very different singularity. Black holes are maximally scrambled information\u2014the highest entropy things we know of in the universe. One of the great mysteries about the origin of the universe is that it\u2019s a very low-entropy state. If you want to know more about that, Sean Carroll writes a lot about it. It\u2019s different. Are they related? Our understanding of them surely is, but it\u2019s really not clear. When you add quantum mechanics in, you begin to ask questions about whether the Big Bang singularity\u2014if there is such a thing in the past\u2014what is it? Is it the beginning of time? There\u2019s the no-boundary idea that Hawking and others had. Again, all bets are off. I think it is correct to say that the understanding of the two is related, but we understand neither at the moment.\\n\\nCleo Abram: I\u2019m sure that I am garbling fragments of understanding from things that you have explained, but does it feel related at all that there is the hologram principle\u2014that we can be described in two dimensions, that there can be a two-dimensional kind of description of a huge amount of three-dimensional mass that fell into a black hole\u2014and is it possible that we are all living on the outside of a black hole right now? What is the question I\u2019m trying to ask?\\n\\nBrian Cox: It\u2019s a great question. There is a cosmological horizon; there are different kinds of cosmological horizons. It\u2019s a very good question, but people don\u2019t really even know how to phrase it. Could it be that you can describe the whole universe in terms of a quantum theory living on a boundary of some description? I think the guess is yes, but we don\u2019t even know what we mean by the boundary. The reason that Maldacena was able to show this in AdS/CFT is that it works for a very specific space\u2014AdS space\u2014because there\u2019s a boundary you can identify in that particular geometry. Our universe is de Sitter. It\u2019s not obvious what you mean by a boundary. It\u2019s not really obvious what question we\u2019re asking. As you said, it\u2019s hard to find the words. The rough picture\u2014that there could be a quantum theory, somehow this network of qubits that gives rise to geometry, spacetime\u2014is accepted broadly. But when you try to get into the detail of it, it\u2019s only been fully realized for a very specific model that\u2019s kind of a toy model; it\u2019s not our universe. It could be that our universe does not admit that description. It could be. It\u2019s certainly beyond us at the moment technically. But it\u2019s a wonderful thought.\\n\\nCleo Abram: It\u2019s so cool, and thank you for taking that question so seriously.\\n\\nBrian Cox: It\u2019s a great question. I think it\u2019s really instructive that neither of us\u2014because nobody\u2014has the language. When you get into the real detail, you\u2019re talking about mathematics ultimately, and even the mathematics is not complete. We\u2019re talking about research at the cutting edge, and it takes a long time. Even quantum mechanics\u2014if we were talking about quantum mechanics\u2014it\u2019s a hundred-year-old theory that\u2019s very well tested and very well understood. But when you try to put it into language to speak about it, it\u2019s much easier to write down the equations. Feynman says that in the Feynman Lectures when he talks about the double-slit experiment. It\u2019s a great description of the way quantum mechanics behaves. Ultimately Feynman says, mathematically it\u2019s easy\u2014he can write down one line that tells you how the interference works and all those things\u2014but then if you try to say what it means for our picture of reality, we\u2019re still arguing about that now. But the maths is easy. Here, the maths is really difficult, and we have no idea what it\u2019s telling us about reality.\\n\\nCleo Abram: One of the things that I really admire about you and your work is that you have this sense of wonder at the universe. The thing I\u2019ve most appreciated about it\u2014and I\u2019m sure I speak for a lot of people\u2014is that you give that sense of wonder back to people. You say, \u201cHey, don\u2019t you remember what it was like when you were a little kid looking up at the sky?\u201d In fact, as you learn more about the universe, that sense of wonder can increase, not decrease. I think that\u2019s really special, and I think that people need that. First, I just wanted to say thank you. And second, my last question for you is: how do you feel when you go outside and look up at the night sky, given what you know?\\n\\nBrian Cox: It\u2019s a wonderful question. You alluded to it earlier: the sense of awe and the sense of mystery and beauty increase the more you know about what you\u2019re looking at. They don\u2019t decrease. The number of mysteries increases the more you look at it. It is incomprehensible, even if you think about the Milky Way. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to look at. If it\u2019s a clear night and you\u2019re away from the city lights, we\u2019ve all looked at the Milky Way at some point. If you try to picture what it is and you learn that it\u2019s a galaxy of\u2014what\u2014200 billion, maybe 400 billion suns. What does that mean? Two hundred billion suns. Most of them have planets. So there will be trillions of planets. It takes light 100,000 years to cross that thing. None of that\u2014you can\u2019t internalize even that, and that\u2019s kind of a simple thing because it\u2019s just a galaxy and we know about galaxies. Then you talk about\u2014at the center of that galaxy lies this thing, the supermassive black hole\u2014and we don\u2019t know what that thing is. You can look towards it. You can look towards Sagittarius. The further south you are, the easier it will be to look at, but you can look in the direction of the center of the galaxy. You can go out, if you\u2019re not too far north, and look at that with your eyes, and wonder about it. I really believe\u2014Richard Feynman said it many years ago, many other people have said it\u2014that the more you understand about nature, the more mysterious and magical it becomes. It\u2019s a beautiful place.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Then thank you so much for your time.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like any edits.

In Einstein\u2019s general relativity, matter curves spacetime; the Schwarzschild solution shows that if a massive star collapses within its critical radius, an event horizon forms and nothing\u2014light included\u2014can escape. Inside, the singularity is not a place but an inevitable moment in time for any infaller. Observationally, images of Sagittarius A* show lensed light from a hot accretion disk, matching GR\u2019s predictions. Black holes range from a few to billions of solar masses; lower-mass remnants become white dwarfs or neutron stars due to quantum degeneracy pressure, but above a few solar masses gravity wins.\\n\\nFalling in, you feel nothing at the horizon of a supermassive hole (equivalence principle), though tidal forces nearer the singularity cause \u201cspaghettification.\u201d To distant observers, your clock slows and appears to freeze at the horizon. Quantum effects change the story: Hawking showed black holes radiate and eventually evaporate, prompting the information paradox. Early calculations suggested the radiation was \u201cinformationless,\u201d but modern results (Page time, island formula) indicate the outgoing radiation ultimately encodes all the information, pointing to the holographic principle: a black hole\u2019s entropy scales with horizon area, not volume. Black hole complementarity reconciles infaller \u201cno drama\u201d with exterior \u201chot horizon,\u201d and ideas like ER = EPR (wormholes as entanglement) plus AdS/CFT duality suggest spacetime may emerge from quantum entanglement\u2014effectively a network of qubits. Toy experiments on quantum processors hint at this picture. Open problems remain (firewall paradox, extending holography to our de Sitter universe), and the Big Bang and black hole singularities likely differ in entropy structure. The conversation ends with a reminder that deeper understanding heightens, rather than diminishes, our sense of cosmic wonder.\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  text={\r\n    \"format\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"text\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"verbosity\": \"high\"\r\n  },\r\n  reasoning={\r\n    \"effort\": \"high\",\r\n    \"summary\": null\r\n  },\r\n  tools=[],\r\n  store=True\r\n)"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"retrieval_turn_number":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"request_id":"9737e30fe98091ba-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"83d479ce-2175-4d7d-b6c9-de83b2fbbb31","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"83d479ce-2175-4d7d-b6c9-de83b2fbbb31","children":["a3816abd-78ea-44da-9778-b08601dc90c1"]},"a3816abd-78ea-44da-9778-b08601dc90c1":{"id":"a3816abd-78ea-44da-9778-b08601dc90c1","message":{"id":"a3816abd-78ea-44da-9778-b08601dc90c1","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1755923556.4424613,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded.

Inside, the singularity represents the end of time, not just a dense point.  \n- **Observations:** Images like Sagittarius A*\u2019s reveal light bent from accretion disks, confirming relativity\u2019s predictions. Black holes span from stellar-mass to supermassive; degeneracy pressure explains why smaller stars form white dwarfs or neutron stars instead.  \n- **Falling in:** Free fall across the horizon feels normal (equivalence principle), but near the singularity tidal forces cause spaghettification.

Early work suggested yes, but modern advances (Page time, island formula) imply the radiation encodes information, aligning with conservation laws.  \n- **Holography and complementarity:** Black hole entropy scales with horizon area, suggesting information lives on the boundary.

talking  about the center is also a little bit incorrect  \\n27:31\\nhow should I actually think about what is  happening at that singularity well I mean the   the first thing to say is we don't know right so  so with um we can talk about the current research  \\n27:42\\nand speculation um we don't really have the tools  to describe it so a way to think about Einstein's  \\n27:50\\ntheory is that as I mentioned earlier it really  tells you how space and time are distorted they  \\n27:55\\nalso kind of get mixed get up from from from the  point of view of someone outside so then you'll  \\n28:03\\nsee that space and time are are getting warped and  distorted and as I mentioned they get so mixed up  \\n28:10\\nthat on the horizon you see that they flip um so  the thing to bear in mind for all that follows  \\n28:17\\nwith Einstein's theory is this very central idea  that if you're freely falling through space or  \\n28:26\\nover spacetime if you like then you don't in in  the absence of these tidal effects you you really  \\n28:35\\ncannot tell that you're where you are in the  universe if you're close to a black hole close to  \\n28:41\\na big star orbiting around a galaxy just falling  whatever it is so I think that's the key idea this  \\n28:48\\nso-called equivalence principle um but of course  the as we said before the thing about a black hole  \\n28:56\\nis that why don't you see the you could say why  don't I see these effects on the earth um this  \\n29:01\\ndistortion this mixing or and you do um so you  see it in GPS satellites for example so um if you  \\n29:10\\nthink about what I said I said as you go closer  to this thing then as viewed from the outside time   passes more slowly um so you you could say well  why doesn't the earth do that and it does so what  \\nYou see this on Earth\\n29:23\\nyou see is that time ticks at a different rate  well by which I mean clocks tick at a different  \\n29:28\\nrate atomic clocks or biological clocks so you age  at a different rate in orbit than you do on the  \\n29:35\\nsurface of the Earth and you're seeing this is the  same effect the the reason it gets very extreme  \\n29:41\\nand I should say it's quite a big effect for even  near the earth so the drift is tens of thousands  \\n29:49\\nof nanconds per day time the the a difference in  the rate that time passes at the at the orbit of a  \\n29:57\\na GPS satellite and on the ground and we have to  accommodate for that accommodate for that other   it doesn't work but it's tens of thousands  of nanconds per day even around the earth  \\n30:07\\nso the question of black hole really is as you  said before if I could keep the mass of the Earth  \\n30:13\\nthe same but shrink it down to the size of a P  then how much how does that distortion change as  \\n30:19\\nI go closer and closer to this immensely massive P  thing then how does and and the that's this is the\n# \u30101\u2020brian cox

Snippet:\n[L1] It's definitely true that nothing comes out of the black hole. So how is the information about this thing getting imprinted in the radiation? Initially, quite a few people thought it must be just right at the end, when it's all quantum gravity and weird stuff\u2014so the thing's just about to disappear back into the universe, it's getting hotter and hotter as it gets smaller, more and more violent, and something weird happens and everything comes out. But it was known for a long time\u2014there's work by a great physicist called Don Page\u2014that the problems about the information and the structure of space occur about halfway through the black hole's life. It's called the Page time. The problems occur way before you should be thinking about quantum gravity and a load of weird stuff. There was a big challenge to physics: we should be able to calculate stuff when the black hole is halfway through its life. There's nothing weird at the horizon, but yet something weird appears to be happening. The picture of the thing is breaking down.\\n\\nBrian Cox: So what is the picture of this? I should emphasize the health warning: this is ongoing research and there is no agreed-upon picture, and there are some other subtleties we'll talk about in a minute.

Jacob Bekenstein, one of the pioneers along with Stephen Hawking, calculated the entropy of a black hole. Hawking had calculated the temperature\u2014his equation for the temperature of a black hole is inscribed on his gravestone in Westminster Abbey. Temperature, which we now understand as the average motion of the component parts of a system, is familiar for things made of stuff\u2014heat up water and the molecules jiggle faster. But a black hole is just geometry. It\u2019s space and time. So immediately we have the temperature of a geometry, not of a thing made of stuff. That\u2019s interesting. Then Bekenstein calculated that the entropy\u2014the measure of hidden information\u2014of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of its event horizon, measured in square Planck lengths. It\u2019s a remarkable idea. You can think of the horizon, from the outside point of view, as having information encoded on it in pixels one Planck length across. And that\u2019s weird, because if I ask how much information is contained in this room, you might say it\u2019s to do with the volume\u2014the number of books in a library. This says no: at a fundamental level, the amount of information is determined by the surface area, not the volume. It\u2019s almost as if nature says you can paper the outside of the library with the pages of the book.\n# \u30102\u2020brian cox 01.json\u2020file-UDLxZ1fmtndtbb6NnkNyzk\u3011\nContent source:

black hole should look like that\u2014this characteristic donut shape. Here's an image with radio telescopes of such a thing, and it looks like the prediction. It is a bit blurry, but this is at the center of the galaxy\u2014very difficult. This was actually the second one that was imaged. The first one was in a galaxy called M87, which is 55 million light-years away and is bigger than this one.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Our black hole\u2014how big is it compared to other black holes that we know exist?\\n\\nBrian Cox: It's a smallish one\u2014well, it's a supermassive black hole, but compared to some others it's on the smaller side. We think that, to a good approximation, all galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers. We don't quite know why, actually. We don't quite know how galaxies form in the early universe. It's one of the things that the James Webb Space Telescope is looking at in some detail. They can be different masses. As I said, the M87 galaxy has one that's about 6 billion times the mass of the Sun, rather than about 6 million times the mass of the Sun for this one.\\n\\nBrian Cox: How big is it? The number I always remember in my mind is the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun, which is the radius you'd have to squash the Sun down to in order to make a black hole, and it's 3 kilometers. It goes like the mass, so you can work it out. If Sagittarius A* is about 6 million times the mass of the Sun, then the Schwarzschild radius is 6 million times 3 kilometers. That gives you an idea of the size of the structure. The disk outside it is much bigger.\\n\\nCleo Abram: I did the math with Earth's radius, and it seemed to suggest that we would become a black hole if we compressed everything on Earth\u2014and all of us\u2014into something about the size of a pea.\\n\\nBrian Cox: From memory it's about 0.8 centimeters, just less than a centimeter, so you're right\u2014about that big.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Do black holes that small exist?\\n\\nBrian Cox: No, we don't think so. Even black holes the mass of the Sun\u2014the Sun will not form a black hole when it runs out of nuclear fuel. It will collapse, and there's something that can stop it collapsing: the force associated with electrons. It's called a white dwarf star. It's a beautiful calculation. What stops it, as an aside, is the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons don't want to be too close together, roughly speaking. As you squash the thing, the electrons get closer together, so they separate away from each other and go into smaller and smaller regions of space because they're trying to stay away from each other. But there's also Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. As you confine them into smaller regions, they start jiggling around faster and faster. Ultimately you reach a limit where they're essentially trying to jiggle at the speed of light\u2014and they can't\u2014so there's a limit to how much pressure that process can exert. It turns out it's 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, which is called the Chandrasekhar limit.\\n\\nBrian Cox: You can do that calculation without knowing that stars exist. All you need to know is quantum mechanics and relativity, and you can work out the biggest lump of stuff that can be held up by this jiggling of electrons.\nVisible: 0% -

\"2:0\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] It hasn\u2019t been resolved yet. The problem is that when you disrupt space in the way a black hole does, and when you try to understand what\u2019s happening to the information and the entangled particles that are on one side of the horizon and the other\u2014the Hawking radiation we discussed earlier\u2014you bump up against a problem. Maybe this description of the equivalence principle and of us freely falling across the horizon from our perspective into the interior of the black hole doesn\u2019t quite stand up. Maybe you\u2019re getting a challenge to this basis of general relativity. Maybe it\u2019s really true that there isn\u2019t an interior of the black hole. Maybe it\u2019s really true that you don\u2019t go in\u2014there isn\u2019t an \u201cin.\u201d If you search through the literature, you\u2019ll see those papers were big in this debate. Some people thought it was solved; other people thought it wasn\u2019t. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the jury is still out on these issues. The thing to emphasize is that there\u2019s something really fundamental going on here, and it almost certainly is associated with the nature of space and time themselves\u2014spacetime. It\u2019s associated with geometries of spacetime\u2014maybe wormholes, maybe those kinds of things. It\u2019s tremendously interesting. It develops so fast and our understanding is developing so fast. The last thing to say is it does look like there is a description of the universe that looks like a giant quantum computer in some sense, which does not imply that someone built it\u2014it\u2019s not a simulation\u2014but it does suggest that there\u2019s a good description of reality that you can write down in the form of some kind of network of entangled qubits, presumably at the Planck scale\u2014who knows, maybe even that\u2019s not obvious\u2014but something like that.\\n\\nCleo Abram: I came into this story thinking that I was going to tell about falling into a black hole and then eventually get to the cutting edge of research into black holes and that that was going to be the end of the story. But actually what I\u2019m hearing you say now is that the cutting edge of research into black holes is actually a cutting edge of research into the universe itself, and that is just incredibly exciting.\\n\\nBrian Cox: It\u2019s really beautiful, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019re the window\u2014almost like the Rosetta stones that are allowing us to translate between different pictures of the universe.\\n\\nCleo Abram: All right, so that\u2019s probably where we end. If I rewind for a second, one of my questions to connect things that I know about the universe is: what is the relationship we think between the singularity at the center of a black hole and the point that Big Banged?\\n\\nBrian Cox: It\u2019s a very good question. The singularity inside a black hole in Einstein\u2019s theory is the end of time. In Einstein\u2019s theory alone of the evolution of the universe, there is another singularity at the other end of time, which is the Big Bang singularity. You might be tempted to call it the beginning of time. It\u2019s a very different singularity. Black holes are maximally scrambled information\u2014the highest entropy things we know of in the universe. One of the great mysteries about the origin of the universe is that it\u2019s a very low-entropy state. If you want to know more about that, Sean Carroll writes a lot about it. It\u2019s different. Are they related? Our understanding of them surely is, but it\u2019s really not clear. When you add quantum mechanics in, you begin to ask questions about whether the Big Bang singularity\u2014if there is such a thing in the past\u2014what is it? Is it the beginning of time? There\u2019s the no-boundary idea that Hawking and others had. Again, all bets are off.\n# \u30101\u2020brian cox 01.json\u2020file-UDLxZ1fmtndtbb6NnkNyzk\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: brian cox 01.json\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file1\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:1\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Sagittarius A\\n10:08\\nhorizon it's in the future so it's like if you say  well I want to escape this thing it's like saying  \\n10:15\\nI want to escape tomorrow if I said to you let's  run away from tomorrow you go I can't run away  \\n10:21\\nfrom tomorrow it's in the future that's what this  thing behaves like a singularity so that's the the  \\n10:27\\nEinsteinian description of a black hole i want  to take that step by step to understand it okay  \\n10:36\\nso in order to understand this let's imagine that  we choose the black hole at the center of our own  \\n10:42\\ngalaxy yeah sagittarius A star I think it's called  I know that we took this picture of it in that is  \\n10:49\\nby the event horizon telescope Sagittarius A  star what are we looking at here so here um  \\n10:56\\nthe light you might say what is the light in this  picture so it's not from the black hole cuz we've  \\n11:01\\njust said black holes trap light it's from what's  called the accretion disc around the black hole  \\n11:07\\nso you're to imagine really material spiraling  around in orbit around this very dense object  \\n11:14\\num and very violently orbiting and so it heats up  and it emits light you imagine a a flat thin disc  \\n11:21\\nof material around the black hole but this does  not look like that um what you're seeing is the  \\n11:28\\ndistortion the curvature of the light rays because  we said that you might think well light travels in  \\n11:34\\nstraight lines um but Einstein's theory says that  in the vicinity of this thing the fabric of the  \\n11:40\\nuniverse itself is distorted so the light the  paths of the light rays follow the distortion  \\n11:47\\njust like that's why in an animation it looks like  it's going over the top and around the sides at   the same time so what you're seeing this famous  image of a black hole like if you think of the  \\n11:54\\nfilm Interstellar that that code by the way is an  implementation of Einstein's equations kip Thorne  \\n12:01\\nand others help them do that so so it's really a  prediction so what you're seeing so imagine this  \\n12:06\\ndisc of material around this thing like picture  in your mind's eye Saturn then light rays let's  \\n12:12\\nsay from your perspective from behind the black  hole on the let's say that on the disc go around  \\n12:20\\ninto your eyes sometimes they orbit and then  go around into your eyes and they go into your  \\n12:26\\neyes from every point on the disc from underneath  and at the top and behind so you have light rays  \\n12:32\\ngoing always around this thing so so then you so  you see that that's what you see as an image so  \\n12:38\\nthere's a prediction of Einstein's theory which  is a real black hole should look like that it's  \\n12:45\\ncharacteristic donut shape that you see well  here's here's an image with radio telescopes of  \\n12:51\\nof such a thing and it looks like the prediction  it is a bit blurry but you know this is at the  \\n12:56\\ncenter of the galaxy very difficult this was  actually the second one that was imaged\n# \u30102\u2020brian cox 01.json\u2020file-UDLxZ1fmtndtbb6NnkNyzk\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: brian cox 01.json\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] In order to understand this, let's imagine that we choose the black hole at the center of our own galaxy\u2014Sagittarius A*. I know that we took this picture of it with the Event Horizon Telescope. What are we looking at here?\\n\\nBrian Cox: The light in this picture is not from the black hole, because we've just said black holes trap light. It's from what's called the accretion disk around the black hole. You should imagine material spiraling in orbit around this very dense object, violently orbiting so it heats up and emits light. Picture a flat, thin disk of material around the black hole. But this does not look like that. What you're seeing is the distortion\u2014the curvature\u2014of the light rays. You might think light travels in straight lines, but Einstein's theory says that in the vicinity of this thing the fabric of the universe itself is distorted, so the paths of the light rays follow the distortion. That's why, in an animation, it looks like it's going over the top and around the sides at the same time.\\n\\nBrian Cox: Think of this famous image of a black hole. If you think of the film Interstellar, that code was an implementation of Einstein's equations\u2014Kip Thorne and others helped them do that\u2014so it's really a prediction. Imagine this disk of material around this thing. Light rays from behind the black hole, from the disk, go around into your eyes. Sometimes they orbit and then go around into your eyes. They reach your eyes from every point on the disk\u2014from underneath and at the top and behind\u2014so you have light rays going all ways around this thing. That's what you see as an image. It's a prediction of Einstein's theory that a real black hole should look like that\u2014this characteristic donut shape. Here's an image with radio telescopes of such a thing, and it looks like the prediction. It is a bit blurry, but this is at the center of the galaxy\u2014very difficult. This was actually the second one that was imaged. The first one was in a galaxy called M87, which is 55 million light-years away and is bigger than this one.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Our black hole\u2014how big is it compared to other black holes that we know exist?\\n\\nBrian Cox: It's a smallish one\u2014well, it's a supermassive black hole, but compared to some others it's on the smaller side. We think that, to a good approximation, all galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers. We don't quite know why, actually. We don't quite know how galaxies form in the early universe. It's one of the things that the James Webb Space Telescope is looking at in some detail. They can be different masses. As I said, the M87 galaxy has one that's about 6 billion times the mass of the Sun, rather than about 6 million times the mass of the Sun for this one.\\n\\nBrian Cox: How big is it? The number I always remember in my mind is the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun, which is the radius you'd have to squash the Sun down to in order to make a black hole, and it's 3 kilometers. It goes like the mass, so you can work it out. If Sagittarius A* is about 6 million times the mass of the Sun, then the Schwarzschild radius is 6 million times 3 kilometers. That gives you an idea of the size of the structure.\n# \u30103\u2020brian cox 01.json\u2020file-UDLxZ1fmtndtbb6NnkNyzk\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: brian cox 01.json\nCitation Marker:

\\n15:46\\nas you squash the thing the electrons get closer  together and so they kind of separate away from  \\n15:52\\neach other and go into smaller and smaller little  regions of space because they're trying to stay   away from each other but there's also something  called the uncertainty principle heisenberg's  \\n16:01\\nuncertainty principle so as you confine them  into smaller regions they they start jiggling  \\n16:07\\naround faster and faster um and ultimately you can  reach a limit where they're essentially trying to  \\n16:12\\njiggle at the speed of light and they can't and so  there's a limit to how much pressure that process  \\n16:19\\ncan exert and it turns out it's 1.4 times the mass  of the sun which is called the Chandra Seca limit  \\n16:25\\nuh so you can do that calculation but it's a  beautiful calculation because you could have   worked that out not knowing that stars exist all  you need to know about is quantum mechanics and  \\n16:36\\nrelativity and you can make the calculation what  is the biggest lump of stuff that can be held up  \\n16:42\\nby this jiggling of electrons it turns out it's  1.4 times the mass of the sun then you look into  \\n16:47\\nthe sky and you see there are these things called  white dwarfs these collapsed stars which are and  \\n16:52\\nthere's none more massive than 1.4 four times  the mass of the sun so it's very beautiful and   then you can get neutron stars which are held up  by the jiggling of neutrons but ultimately if you  \\n17:02\\ngo to something that's three three times the  mass of the sun something like that a bit more   then nothing stops it collapsing and that's when  you form a black hole so the most the lightest  \\n17:12\\nblack holes that we know of around that mass  right and then and then we know of them that  \\n17:18\\nare 10 20 30 times the mass of the sun from  collapsed stars and then these things which  \\n17:24\\nare millions of times or even more the mass of  the sun which are the heart of galaxies so we've  \\n17:30\\nlaunched in our spaceship we are hurtling toward  this black hole could you walk us through step by  \\n17:35\\nstep what happens from now until when we hit the  event horizon yeah so the first thing to say is  \\n17:42\\nthat it's right at the heart of Einstein's  theory is something called the equivalence   principle which was the idea that really led  Einstein to the theory itself of gravity and  \\n17:53\\num so you don't feel its pull you what you do is  you just fall freely towards it so we're falling  \\n17:59\\ntowards this thing now and we turn our rocket  motors off um you we can't tell if we can't look  \\n18:06\\noutside we can't look out the windows we're just  in freef fall we're just floating so it's like the atmosphere we're just there so it's fundamental to  Einstein's theory it's very important actually for  \\n18:21\\nthe problems that follow that we're going to talk  about that you just freely fall

right you  separate the quantum coins to a large distance  \\n49:54\\nthen it's still the case that this thing is in  this what's called a superp position of heads   and tails then you you you make a

Snippet:\n[L1] We struggle with it. It\u2019s hard for us. One description I saw of why we are glimpsing this deeper structure of nature when we think about black holes\u2014which are real things\u2014was that it\u2019s almost as if this thing slices through space and leaves the building blocks of space dangling right at the horizon. Gravity has created a situation where you come face to face with the structure of space and time. In retrospect the hints were there: temperature and entropy, and information encoded in space. It looks like we\u2019re starting to glimpse a theory of the underlying structure of space and time.\\n\\nBrian Cox: This goes by the name of emergent spacetime. The picture would be that you have a description that looks, for all the world, like a network of qubits\u2014which is what a quantum computer is. It looks like there\u2019s a description of the universe that doesn\u2019t have space and time in it, but is just a network; it\u2019s just information. That goes all the way back to John Wheeler\u2014the great physicist\u2014who called it \u201cit from bit.\u201d \u201cIt\u201d is this, and \u201cbit\u201d is information. That\u2019s what it looks like we\u2019re seeing. Our window onto this deeper theory\u2014call it quantum gravity if you like\u2014has been very simple questions about black holes, which are real things. That\u2019s why Hawking\u2019s calculation is so important: it\u2019s the first precise glimpse of a problem with our picture of the world. It\u2019s a precise question: does this thing destroy information or not? If it doesn\u2019t, how does the information get out? It\u2019s a simple question that has led\u2014and is still leading\u2014to all these developments. You would get different pictures from any expert who does the calculations. They would not be certain about the physical picture, I think it\u2019s fair to say.\\n\\nCleo Abram: So is it fair to say that the specific research into black holes, the specific questions we\u2019re asking about black holes, are helping us unlock much deeper questions about the universe as a whole?\\n\\nBrian Cox: Exactly. It\u2019s wonderful. One of the wonderful things is that the techniques you develop as a PhD student or a postdoc\u2014or someone working in this area\u2014to try to understand what the black hole is doing are the same techniques you need if you want to understand how quantum computers work. That\u2019s a real engineering question as well as a fundamental physics question. We\u2019re trying to build these things. We haven\u2019t built one that works in the way we want yet, but obviously Google and Microsoft and IBM and others are pouring a lot of money into it because they\u2019re profoundly powerful devices. A lot of insight now into how they might work and how we might build them is coming from this field of emergent spacetime. It\u2019s the best example I know of. If you say to a funding agency, \u201cI want money to work on black holes,\u201d they might ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use? Does anybody care?\u201d The lesson is that when you study nature and go to things that pose profound questions about our understanding of physics, you are likely to learn something useful, because you\u2019re studying reality. This is the best example I know, because you\u2019re studying completely collapsed stars or the things at the hearts of galaxies, and you\u2019re gaining insight into quantum computers and networks of qubits and quantum information. It\u2019s the most wonderful thing.\\n\\nBrian Cox: People are beginning to use the Google chip\u2014the Willow chip\u2014which is a very powerful proto\u2013quantum computer. What it is, is a load of qubits that you can entangle. You can set it up and it\u2019s very well controlled.\n# \u30103\u2020brian cox 01.json\u2020file-UDLxZ1fmtndtbb6NnkNyzk\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: brian cox 01.json\nCitation Marker:

That's the way I see myself. If someone asks me what I do, I say I'm a physicist. But actually, of course, most of my time now is spent on the public engagement side, and I kind of fell into that accidentally. Still, maybe there's some deep psychological thing going on, but I never say TV presenter or whatever it is\u2014I just say physicist.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Well, that's what I want to talk to you all about today. Imagine that you and I are on a mission to fall into a black hole, and we have some imaginary spaceship that can take us as far and as fast as we want. So we get up, we walk outside, we get into our spaceship. What now? What is a black hole, and how do we find them?\\n\\nPlease confirm if you'd like me to proceed to the next section: \u201cFoundations of black holes: Einstein\u2019s spacetime, Schwarzschild, collapse, and horizons.\u201d\"\r\n[L13]         }\r\n[L14]       ]\r\n[L15]     },\r\n[L16]     {\r\n[L17]       \"role\": \"user\",\r\n[L18]       \"content\": [\r\n[L19]         {\r\n[L20]           \"type\": \"input_text\",\r\n[L21]           \"text\": \"Please proceed.\"\n# \u30102\u2020brian cox 01.json\u2020file-UDLxZ1fmtndtbb6NnkNyzk\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: brian cox 01.json\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn4file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"4:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] ways you might not want but  incogn force many of them to remove you let me  \\n24:28\\nshow you so they reach out to day brokers on my  behalf and they say \\\"Hey remove this person.\\\" And   then crucially they follow up to make sure that I  actually got removed i really appreciate this and  \\n24:37\\nI think you might too if you want to try it out  use the code Cleo Abram at the link below and get   60% off an annual plan now back to black holes so  at this moment we cross the event horizon and we  \\n24:48\\ndon't feel that we could have gone we could have  crossed it now just now wouldn't notice and our  \\n24:55\\nexperience now is completely inside the blackness  of the black hole from an outsers's perspective  \\nSpaghettification\\n25:03\\ngravity is increasing faster and faster and  this is where we get to maybe my favorite word  \\n25:10\\nuh that I have learned in the process of this  which is when the my understanding of this is when   the gravity at your feet is so different from the  gravity at your head that you begin to stretch in  \\n25:22\\na very dramatic way and this is spaghettification  could you explain what is happening here yeah as  \\n25:28\\nyou get one way of thinking about it is that  that the the the another way of thinking about  \\n25:34\\nit is just that the space the distortion in  spaceime is is not constant over the length  \\n25:41\\nof your body so when we're falling in we might  as well be this is the Einstein's equivalence  \\n25:47\\nprinciple in action we might as well be in flat  space because the distortion it's like saying  \\n25:53\\nuh on the surface of the earth um if you look at  a mile a square mile of the surface of the earth  \\n25:59\\nyou don't feel the you don't see the curvature  right you have to go to bigger distances to see   that you're on a curved surface it's kind of like  that so so the the distortion the difference in  \\n26:09\\ngravitational pull as you said or the distortion  you don't feel it until it becomes very distorted  \\n26:14\\nor there's a big gravitational pull when you  get very close to this thing And then you start   to see that and actually it works it's not only  stretching it's also a squashing so the way the  \\n26:25\\ntidal gravity works is to squash in one direction  and pull in the other direction so we are getting   so you feel it so you start to feel this strange  sort of sensation of being stretched and squashed  \\n26:37\\nand and and as you go closer and closer to  the singularity those effects become much   more extreme until this so extreme that first  of all you you cease to right stick stay stay  \\n26:47\\ntogether we're one long string of atoms what are  we yeah and then the atoms get get separated and  \\n26:53\\nthen the protons the quarks inside the protons  will get separated and ultimately according to  \\n26:58\\nEinstein's theory the tidal forces become infinite  So that in formally infinite and so everything has  \\n27:05\\ngone everything has been ripped apart and that  this is what we call the singularity so so the  \\n27:11\\nwhole thing kind of gets very extreme and breaks  down ultimately in Einstein's picture the question\n# \u30103\u2020brian cox 01.json\u2020file-UDLxZ1fmtndtbb6NnkNyzk\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: brian cox 01.json\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn4file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"4:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Do only one section at a time.\\n7.

You might say, what's the difference? If I get this piece of paper and set fire to it, it goes and there's just ashes and radiation. Yes, but in principle, if you could measure everything\u2014though you can't\u2014you could reconstruct the information on the page. What's happening when you burn it is chemical reactions, oxidation, and so on. You can trace everything back. All the atoms and things are still around. In a black hole, you can't. So it wasn't surprising that there was a problem. What was surprising is that there appeared to be a calculation that tells you black holes erase everything. As you said, the laws of nature are quite clear on this: information does not get destroyed in the universe. It gets scrambled so you can never reconstruct it, but it doesn't get destroyed. That's what bothered everybody for a very long time.\\n\\nBrian Cox: The end of the story\u2014we're not at the end, but in 2019 a series of papers were published, one by Jeff Pennington and another by a different group of authors, suggesting that Hawking missed a bit in his calculation. Very subtle\u2014he could never have seen it. That's why it took 50 years to see what he'd missed. It turns out that the radiation is not information-free. At the end of the process, all the information about everything that fell in is imprinted in the radiation, as you would normally expect.\\n\\nBrian Cox: Then it becomes interesting, because you say, what's the picture? I understand that if I take this and throw it into the black hole, it's gone across the horizon and gone to the singularity. It's definitely true that nothing comes out of the black hole. So how is the information about this thing getting imprinted in the radiation? Initially, quite a few people thought it must be just right at the end, when it's all quantum gravity and weird stuff\u2014so the thing's just about to disappear back into the universe, it's getting hotter and hotter as it gets smaller, more and more violent, and something weird happens and everything comes out. But it was known for a long time\u2014there's work by a great physicist called Don Page\u2014that the problems about the information and the structure of space occur about halfway through the black hole's life. It's called the Page time. The problems occur way before you should be thinking about quantum gravity and a load of weird stuff. There was a big challenge to physics: we should be able to calculate stuff when the black hole is halfway through its life. There's nothing weird at the horizon, but yet something weird appears to be happening. The picture of the thing is breaking down.\\n\\nBrian Cox: So what is the picture of this? I should emphasize the health warning: this is ongoing research and there is no agreed-upon picture, and there are some other subtleties we'll talk about in a minute.

Everything has gone to this infinitely distorted space and time and it's done.\\n\\nCleo Abram: What would Stephen Hawking say?\\n\\nBrian Cox: Stephen Hawking, in the 1970s, discovered that black holes ain't so black. We've said nothing comes out of a black hole\u2014everything that goes in goes to the singularity, it's gone forever, and the black hole lives forever. Hawking calculated that if you do some quantum mechanics around the horizon of the black hole, then empty space\u2014which in quantum mechanics has a rich structure\u2014gets disrupted by the strange behavior of space and time. The result is that particles\u2014photons essentially, what's called Hawking radiation\u2014are emitted from the black hole.\\n\\nBrian Cox: There are different ways of thinking about what's happening. Hawking gave an analogy in his paper, and he said it's just an analogy. People get very worked up online when you talk about it, but Hawking did write it down. A way to picture the quantum vacuum is to imagine particles coming in and out of existence all the time, in accord with the uncertainty principle. In the vicinity of the horizon, this structure gets disrupted. You could have the situation where one of these particles is on the inside and one is on the outside. We know what's happening to the one on the inside: it's going to the singularity. The other one is made real and escapes. That's a picture that Hawking himself gave.\n# \u30102\u2020brian cox 01.json\u2020file-UDLxZ1fmtndtbb6NnkNyzk\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: brian cox 01.json\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn5file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"5:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] In Einstein\u2019s general relativity, matter curves spacetime; the Schwarzschild solution shows that if a massive star collapses within its critical radius, an event horizon forms and nothing\u2014light included\u2014can escape. Inside, the singularity is not a place but an inevitable moment in time for any infaller. Observationally, images of Sagittarius A* show lensed light from a hot accretion disk, matching GR\u2019s predictions. Black holes range from a few to billions of solar masses; lower-mass remnants become white dwarfs or neutron stars due to quantum degeneracy pressure, but above a few solar masses gravity wins.\\n\\nFalling in, you feel nothing at the horizon of a supermassive hole (equivalence principle), though tidal forces nearer the singularity cause \u201cspaghettification.\u201d To distant observers, your clock slows and appears to freeze at the horizon. Quantum effects change the story: Hawking showed black holes radiate and eventually evaporate, prompting the information paradox. Early calculations suggested the radiation was \u201cinformationless,\u201d but modern results (Page time, island formula) indicate the outgoing radiation ultimately encodes all the information, pointing to the holographic principle: a black hole\u2019s entropy scales with horizon area, not volume. Black hole complementarity reconciles infaller \u201cno drama\u201d with exterior \u201chot horizon,\u201d and ideas like ER = EPR (wormholes as entanglement) plus AdS/CFT duality suggest spacetime may emerge from quantum entanglement\u2014effectively a network of qubits. Toy experiments on quantum processors hint at this picture. Open problems remain (firewall paradox, extending holography to our de Sitter universe), and the Big Bang and black hole singularities likely differ in entropy structure.

But for us, we carry on. Gravity is increasing faster and faster as we head inward, and this is where we get to spaghettification.\\n\\nCleo Abram: My understanding is that when the gravity at your feet is so different from the gravity at your head, you begin to stretch in a very dramatic way. This is spaghettification. Could you explain what's happening here?\\n\\nBrian Cox: One way of thinking about it is that the distortion in spacetime is not constant over the length of your body. When we're falling in, we might as well be in flat space\u2014this is the equivalence principle in action\u2014because over small regions you don't notice curvature. It's like saying that on the surface of the Earth, if you look at a square mile, you don't see the curvature; you have to go to bigger distances to see that you're on a curved surface. So you don't feel the difference in gravitational pull until it becomes very distorted when you get very close to this thing. Then you start to see it. Tidal gravity works to squash in one direction and pull in the other. So you start to feel this strange sensation of being stretched and squashed. As you go closer and closer to the singularity, those effects become much more extreme, until they're so extreme that first of all you cease to stay together as a coherent object. Are we one long string of atoms? The atoms get separated. Then the protons\u2014the quarks inside the protons\u2014get separated. Ultimately, according to Einstein's theory, the tidal forces become infinite\u2014formally infinite\u2014so everything has gone. Everything has been ripped apart. This is what we call the singularity.\\n\\nBrian Cox: You asked about time dilation more broadly. You actually see this effect on Earth. Time ticks at a different rate\u2014by which I mean clocks tick at a different rate\u2014in orbit than on the surface of the Earth. It's the same effect.

Jacob Bekenstein, one of the pioneers along with Stephen Hawking, calculated the entropy of a black hole. Hawking had calculated the temperature\u2014his equation for the temperature of a black hole is inscribed on his gravestone in Westminster Abbey. Temperature, which we now understand as the average motion of the component parts of a system, is familiar for things made of stuff\u2014heat up water and the molecules jiggle faster. But a black hole is just geometry. It\u2019s space and time. So immediately we have the temperature of a geometry, not of a thing made of stuff. That\u2019s interesting. Then Bekenstein calculated that the entropy\u2014the measure of hidden information\u2014of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of its event horizon, measured in square Planck lengths. It\u2019s a remarkable idea. You can think of the horizon, from the outside point of view, as having information encoded on it in pixels one Planck length across. And that\u2019s weird, because if I ask how much information is contained in this room, you might say it\u2019s to do with the volume\u2014the number of books in a library. This says no: at a fundamental level, the amount of information is determined by the surface area, not the volume. It\u2019s almost as if nature says you can paper the outside of the library with the pages of the book.\nVisible: 0% -

Snippet:\n[L1] In order to understand this, let's imagine that we choose the black hole at the center of our own galaxy\u2014Sagittarius A*. I know that we took this picture of it with the Event Horizon Telescope. What are we looking at here?\\n\\nBrian Cox: The light in this picture is not from the black hole, because we've just said black holes trap light. It's from what's called the accretion disk around the black hole. You should imagine material spiraling in orbit around this very dense object, violently orbiting so it heats up and emits light. Picture a flat, thin disk of material around the black hole. But this does not look like that. What you're seeing is the distortion\u2014the curvature\u2014of the light rays. You might think light travels in straight lines, but Einstein's theory says that in the vicinity of this thing the fabric of the universe itself is distorted, so the paths of the light rays follow the distortion. That's why, in an animation, it looks like it's going over the top and around the sides at the same time.\\n\\nBrian Cox: Think of this famous image of a black hole. If you think of the film Interstellar, that code was an implementation of Einstein's equations\u2014Kip Thorne and others helped them do that\u2014so it's really a prediction. Imagine this disk of material around this thing. Light rays from behind the black hole, from the disk, go around into your eyes. Sometimes they orbit and then go around into your eyes. They reach your eyes from every point on the disk\u2014from underneath and at the top and behind\u2014so you have light rays going all ways around this thing. That's what you see as an image. It's a prediction of Einstein's theory that a real black hole should look like that\u2014this characteristic donut shape. Here's an image with radio telescopes of such a thing, and it looks like the prediction. It is a bit blurry, but this is at the center of the galaxy\u2014very difficult. This was actually the second one that was imaged. The first one was in a galaxy called M87, which is 55 million light-years away and is bigger than this one.\\n\\nCleo Abram: Our black hole\u2014how big is it compared to other black holes that we know exist?\\n\\nBrian Cox: It's a smallish one\u2014well, it's a supermassive black hole, but compared to some others it's on the smaller side. We think that, to a good approximation, all galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers. We don't quite know why, actually. We don't quite know how galaxies form in the early universe. It's one of the things that the James Webb Space Telescope is looking at in some detail. They can be different masses. As I said, the M87 galaxy has one that's about 6 billion times the mass of the Sun, rather than about 6 million times the mass of the Sun for this one.\\n\\nBrian Cox: How big is it? The number I always remember in my mind is the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun, which is the radius you'd have to squash the Sun down to in order to make a black hole, and it's 3 kilometers. It goes like the mass, so you can work it out. If Sagittarius A* is about 6 million times the mass of the Sun, then the Schwarzschild radius is 6 million times 3 kilometers. That gives you an idea of the size of the structure.\n# \u30102\u2020brian cox 01.json\u2020file-UDLxZ1fmtndtbb6NnkNyzk\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: brian cox 01.json\nCitation Marker:

or so but pretty  much all galaxies have super massive black holes  \\n13:42\\nat their centers we don't quite know why actually  we we don't quite know how galaxies form in the  \\n13:48\\nearly

looking up at the sky?\\\" And actually   in fact as you learn more about the universe that  sense of wonder can increase not decrease and I  \\n1:11:12\\nthink that's really special and I think that  people need that and first I just wanted to say   thank you oh thank you and second my last question  for you is how do you feel when you go outside  \\n1:11:27\\nand look up at the night sky given

internalize even that and that's kind of  a simple thing cuz it's just a galaxy and we know  \\n1:12:44\\nabout galaxies and then you talk about as we've  talked about the center of that galaxy lies

 look at that right you can look at it with your  \\n1:13:14\\neyes and um yeah and wonder about it so that's  what I I really believe i know Richard Feinman said  \\n1:13:23\\nit many years ago many

the star from the fabric  of the universe leaving the distortion behind  \\n6:27\\nand the black hole the idea behind the black  hole is let's say you take let's say you take  \\n6:34\\nthe sun a star the mass of the sun and you just  collapse it and you keep on collapsing it you get  \\n6:41\\nto a point when the the radius of the sun is not  700,000 kilometers which is what is in miles half  \\n6:48\\na million miles i I I'm going to use kilometers  because I can't remember the things in miles we   can everyone can convert it afterwards right so  7,000 km and you squash it down and you squash  \\n7:00\\nit and squash it until its radius becomes 3 km  three then there are several ways to look at this  \\n7:08\\none is that on the surface the speed you'd have  to travel to escape its gravitational pole it's  \\n7:15\\ncalled the escape velocity would exceed the speed  of light that's one way to think about it so even  \\n7:21\\nlight rays emitted from the surface if you could  squash it down that far would just stay there they  \\n7:27\\nwould not escape because they'd be trying to go at  the speed of light and and the escape velocity is   the speed of light and they just stop so what  what happens then if a star collapses inside  \\n7:38\\nthat number which for the mass of the sun 3 km is  called the swatchial radius then it will collapse  \\n7:44\\nwithout limit nothing will stop it and so all  you will get is essentially the geometry of space  \\n7:51\\nand time the curvature and that's a black hole so  it's a thing that traps light in that sense so you  \\n7:58\\nthink about that if you have this surface uh and  space and time are so distorted there that if you  \\n8:05\\ngo in across that surface it's called the event  horizon of the black hole then you can't get out  \\nWhats inside a black hole?\\n8:12\\nyou one way to think about it is you'd have to  travel faster than light to get out another way   to think about it is that um there's a beautiful  model which is my favorite model it's called the  \\n8:23\\nriver model of a black hole you can write the  equations as as a space being like a river that  \\n8:30\\nflows into this thing almost like a sinkhole or  something in space and the river of space flows  \\n8:36\\nat the speed of light inwards on the horizon and  then faster than light inside so if you imagine\n#
