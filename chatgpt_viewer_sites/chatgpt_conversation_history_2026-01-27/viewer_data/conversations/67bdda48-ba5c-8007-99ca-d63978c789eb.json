However, if you take the premise literally (that we and all the stars in the Milky Way are somehow inside the event horizon of a black hole the size of our galaxy), there are a few key points that would profoundly affect both our day-to-day experience and our fundamental physics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Basic Picture: Why a \u201cGalaxy-Sized\u201d Black Hole Is Unusual\n\nWhen physicists talk about a black hole \u201cthe size of\u201d some radius \\(R\\), they usually refer to the Schwarzschild radius. For a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole of mass \\(M\\), that radius is\n\n\\[\nr_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. The mass required for a black hole to have a radius comparable to the Milky Way\u2019s radius (\\(\\sim 50{,}000\\) light-years) would be truly enormous\u2014far beyond even typical \u201csupermassive\u201d black holes found at galactic centers (which are up to billions of solar masses, but still nowhere near requiring the entire galaxy\u2019s spatial extent as an event horizon). Nonetheless, we can still explore the hypothetical.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Inside the Event Horizon: General-Relativistic Realities\n\n### 2.1 You Cannot Remain Stationary Inside a Black Hole\n\nOnce you are inside a standard, non-rotating black hole\u2019s event horizon, general relativity tells us that **all future-directed worldlines lead inevitably to the singularity**. In other words, \u201cfalling inward\u201d becomes as inevitable as moving forward in time; there is no stable orbit or stable position you can maintain. \n\n- In ordinary space outside a black hole, you can in principle remain at rest (relative to some reference point) if you fire rockets or orbit.  \n- Inside the horizon, even rocket thrust won\u2019t keep you from moving radially inward, any more than you can stop moving forward in time.\n\n**Implication:** If we truly lived inside such a horizon, we could not have stars in stable orbits the way we do in our observable Universe. Everything would be collapsing inexorably onto a central singularity in a finite amount of proper time.\n\n### 2.2 Local vs. Global Observations\n\nOne of the key lessons of relativity is that **local observations** often don\u2019t reveal what is happening on a large (global) scale. An observer in a small lab might do standard experiments with light beams and masses and not realize they are in the interior of a black hole horizon; spacetime can locally look quite ordinary if tidal forces are small.\n\n- If the black hole is *extremely* large, the tidal forces at the horizon might be negligible (so you don\u2019t get \u201cspaghettified\u201d quickly).  \n- This means an observer crossing the event horizon might not notice anything immediately wrong.\n\nHowever, globally, the geometry is radically different: there is no way (even in principle) to avoid moving into the singularity once inside, and signals from inside the horizon cannot propagate to the exterior.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Daily Experience in Such a Hypothetical Scenario\n\nGiven that the premise is extremely hypothetical, one can imagine two ways to interpret \u201cliving inside a galactic-scale black hole\u201d:\n\n1. **The Universe-as-a-Black-Hole Model:** The entire Universe is the interior region of some black hole in a higher-dimensional cosmos. Various speculative cosmological models sometimes toy with this idea. In that scenario, from our vantage point, we simply see an expanding universe and might never realize it\u2019s \u201cthe inside of a black hole.\u201d Our day-to-day life looks like normal cosmic expansion; we have galaxies, stars, etc.\n2. **A Stellar System Inside a Standard Black Hole\u2019s Horizon:** More literal: We are physically inside the event horizon of a black hole that just so happens to have the Schwarzschild radius on the order of the Milky Way\u2019s size.\n\nIn the second scenario\u2014if it followed standard black hole geometry closely\u2014there would be no stable configuration of stars and planets orbiting a center. All matter is collapsing toward a singularity in finite time.\n\n- **Short-lived \u201cdaily life\u201d:** If we magically woke up inside the horizon with no immediate tidal forces, we might have some fleeting period where things *look* normal locally. But globally, we would start to see extreme gravitational effects as everything curves toward the singularity.\n- **Light paths bent drastically:** Observers would notice that light from behind them can get bent into their forward view. Directions might become difficult to interpret as typical reference points collapse. \n- **No stable cosmic structures:** Over timescales far shorter than the billions of years we enjoy in the real Universe, large structures would be destroyed by gravitational collapse.\n\nIn short, the notion of anything like a \u201cdaily routine\u201d inside a standard event horizon would be ephemeral. The end is physically unavoidable.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Observations and Physics If We \u201cDidn\u2019t Know\u201d We Were Inside\n\nIf, hypothetically, the black hole is so huge that the horizon is extremely far away (in the sense of cosmic scale), and we are near the central region with small tidal forces, then locally:\n\n- **We might not notice**. Our local experiments with falling objects, light beams, and so on could appear consistent with \u201cflat\u201d (or gently curved) spacetime.  \n- **Gravitational anomalies at large distances** would eventually be measurable. For instance, if we tried to do astrophysical observations out to large distances, we might notice that all signals come from a sort of \u201ccurved in\u201d region\u2014no signals from beyond the horizon. \n\nAdditionally, in many black-hole-as-universe speculations, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) or certain expansion effects can be interpreted in an alternate geometry sense. We might reinterpret the \u201chorizon\u201d of our universe as a black hole horizon in a higher dimensional space. In such a scenario:\n\n- **Our physics could remain \u201cnormal,\u201d** governed by the same local laws. But the global geometry would be different from standard cosmological models.  \n- **We would measure an \u201ceffective expansion.\u201d** Inside a black hole, if you transform the coordinates in certain ways, the direction toward the singularity can mimic an expanding scale factor (albeit one that ends abruptly in a singularity).\n\nAll of these possibilities show that if we truly had the global vantage point, our knowledge of general relativity and cosmology would differ: we would incorporate the fact that time and space swap roles beyond the horizon, that future = singularity, and that no signals exit once inside.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Would Our Fundamental Physics Be \u201cDifferent\u201d?\n\n- **Locally derived laws** (electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, etc.) might remain as we know them. Nothing about crossing an event horizon necessarily changes standard particle physics or quantum field theory in your immediate lab.  \n- **Our understanding of gravity/cosmology** would definitely be forced to confront the fact that everything is trapped inside a region from which no light can escape. Our entire worldview (on cosmic scales) would revolve around that.  \n- **Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics**: If we recognized that our \u201cuniverse\u201d was a black hole, we might interpret the cosmic microwave background as Hawking-like radiation from the black hole\u2019s horizon (in higher-dimensional space). This leads to different lines of theoretical research in quantum gravity or black hole cosmology.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom Line\n\n1. **Everyday Life**:  \n   - Locally, you might not notice much if the black hole were so enormous that tidal forces are negligible in your region.  \n   - However, there could be no truly stable long-term structures inside a standard black hole event horizon. Eventually, everything must collapse to the singularity.\n\n2. **Observational Clues**:  \n   - You would notice that signals from \u201coutside\u201d never arrive from beyond a certain boundary, or that you cannot send signals outward.  \n   - Light paths, large-scale structure, and the fate of matter would look drastically different from a normal galaxy.\n\n3. **Changed Knowledge of Physics**:  \n   - Locally, quantum field theory and electromagnetism stay the same.  \n   - Globally, general relativity\u2019s predictions (inevitable collapse, horizon boundary, no escape for light) become everyday facts of cosmic structure\u2014altering cosmology textbooks and our entire view of the Universe\u2019s geometry.\n\nIn sum, **actually living inside a black hole** in the sense used by standard GR is short-lived and destructive. If one redefines \u201cblack hole\u201d as \u201ca bound region from which no light escapes to an external higher-dimensional space,\u201d then it is *conceivable* we might interpret our entire Universe that way. But in that scenario, our daily experience would remain essentially what we see now\u2014only our deep theoretical understanding of gravity and cosmology would shift radically once we realized the Universe\u2019s global geometry has an event horizon and a singularity in its future."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"04b101a2-f02c-4a0f-9700-6b5c73aa212d","request_id":"91788be55bca6047-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"04b101a2-f02c-4a0f-9700-6b5c73aa212d","children":["fb0e6840-cbb5-4c73-b51c-c0de0773ac7f"]},"fb0e6840-cbb5-4c73-b51c-c0de0773ac7f":{"id":"fb0e6840-cbb5-4c73-b51c-c0de0773ac7f","message":{"id":"fb0e6840-cbb5-4c73-b51c-c0de0773ac7f","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1741066936.858,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How long would I take to reach the singularity from my frame of reference?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"91af0ca3698bfd77-IAD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8e68ef28-9ff4-40e2-acea-7688a9444ab9","children":["eb72c468-69b9-43af-a23c-c2e7821646dd"]},"eb72c468-69b9-43af-a23c-c2e7821646dd":{"id":"eb72c468-69b9-43af-a23c-c2e7821646dd","message":{"id":"eb72c468-69b9-43af-a23c-c2e7821646dd","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1741066937.891697,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Examining travel time**\n\nI'm considering the time it takes to reach the singularity from the event horizon in a large black hole, focusing on the Schwarzschild model.\n\n**Calculating escape times**\n\nI\u2019m calculating escape times for different black hole masses.

Converting Mass to \u201cHorizon Size\u201d and Proper Time\n\n### 2.1 If the Black Hole Just Has the Mass of the Milky Way\n\n- The Milky Way\u2019s total mass is roughly \\(10^{12}\\) solar masses (\\(M_\\odot\\)).  \n- For **one solar-mass** black hole, \\(\\tau \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\) seconds.  \n- Scaled to \\(10^{12} M_\\odot\\):  \n  \\[\n    \\tau \\,\\approx\\, 6.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{12}\\text{ s} \n    \\;=\\; 6.6 \\times 10^{6}\\text{ s} \n    \\;\\approx\\; 76\\text{ days}.\n  \\]\n\nHence, a Schwarzschild black hole *whose mass equals* the Milky Way\u2019s total mass would have an event horizon only a **tiny fraction** of the Milky Way\u2019s radius\u2014and the free-fall time from horizon to singularity would be on the order of a couple of months.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 If the Black Hole\u2019s Event Horizon Is the Size of the Milky Way\n\nNow suppose you really mean the black hole is so large that its **Schwarzschild radius** (the event-horizon radius) is \\(\\sim 50{,}000\\) light-years, i.e., comparable to the Milky Way\u2019s radial scale. That implies a *far larger* mass.  \n\n- **Radius of event horizon**: \\(r_s = 2GM/c^2.\\)  \n- Set \\(r_s \\approx 50{,}000\\) light-years \\( \\approx 5 \\times 10^4 \\times 10^{16} \\,\\text{m} = 5 \\times 10^{20} \\,\\text{m}.\\)\n\nSolving for \\(M\\):  \n\\[\nM \\;=\\; \\frac{c^2 \\,r_s}{2G}\n\\;\\approx\\; \\frac{(3\\times10^8\\,\\text{m/s})^2 \\;\\times\\; 5\\times10^{20}\\,\\text{m}}{2 \\times 6.67\\times10^{-11}\\,\\text{N\\,m}^2/\\text{kg}^2}.\n\\]\n\nThis works out to roughly  \n\\[\nM \\;\\sim\\; 3\\times10^{47}\\;\\text{kg},\n\\]\nwhich is on the order of  \n\\[\n\\frac{3\\times10^{47}\\,\\text{kg}}{2\\times10^{30}\\,\\text{kg per }M_\\odot}\n\\;\\sim\\; 10^{17}\\,M_\\odot.\n\\]\nThat is one hundred million *times* the total mass of the Milky Way!\n\n#### Proper Time to the Singularity\n\nUsing \\(\\tau = \\tfrac{4}{3}\\,\\tfrac{GM}{c^3}\\) for that mass:\n\n- For **1 solar mass**: \\(\\tau \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\) s.  \n- Multiply by \\(10^{17}\\) (the factor by which the mass exceeds 1 solar mass):  \n  \\[\n  \\tau \\;\\approx\\; 6.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{17} \\;=\\; 6.6 \\times 10^{11} \\,\\text{s} \n  \\;\\approx\\; 2.1\\times 10^4\\,\\text{years}.\n  \\]  \n  (Depending on the exact numbers, you might get something in the range of **tens of thousands of years**.)\n\nThus, **if the black hole\u2019s horizon is truly \u201cthe size of the Milky Way,\u201d** an observer freely falling from (just inside) that horizon would experience on the order of **10,000\u201330,000 years of proper time** before hitting the singularity.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why So Long?\n\nIntuitively, large black holes have \u201cgentler\u201d spacetime curvature at the horizon; tidal forces can be extremely small there. You *still* cannot avoid falling inward\u2014once inside, all future-directed paths lead to \\(r=0\\). But because the hole is so huge, the rate of infall as measured by your own clock is relatively slow. The bigger the black hole, the **longer** (proper-time) fall you have from horizon to singularity.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary Answer\n\n- **For a black hole with roughly the mass of the Milky Way** (\\(\\sim 10^{12}\\) solar masses), the proper time from crossing its (much smaller) horizon to the singularity is on the order of a few **months**.  \n\n- **For a black hole whose Schwarzschild radius truly spans the Milky Way** (\\(\\sim 10^{17}\\) solar masses!), the infall time from horizon to singularity (in your own frame of reference) can be **tens of thousands of years**.  \n\nEither way, once you cross inside the event horizon, there is no stable orbit or way to hover; you are doomed to continue inward. The only difference is **how long** your clock ticks before the fatal encounter with \\(r=0\\)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"eb72c468-69b9-43af-a23c-c2e7821646dd","request_id":"91af0ca3698bfd77-IAD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"eb72c468-69b9-43af-a23c-c2e7821646dd","children":["f824afab-2bd7-45c6-b6b4-d477a578a55b"]},"f824afab-2bd7-45c6-b6b4-d477a578a55b":{"id":"f824afab-2bd7-45c6-b6b4-d477a578a55b","message":{"id":"f824afab-2bd7-45c6-b6b4-d477a578a55b","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1741072640.939,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["would any external observer also move with me to the singularity?

There\u2019s no way for them to hold back and watch you from a stable perch.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Observers Inside the Horizon Are Also Doomed\n\nImagine two observers who cross the horizon: you and your friend. You might be at slightly different radii initially, or have some relative velocity, but **both** of you are inexorably drawn toward \\(r=0\\). You could in principle watch one another fall in (at least for a while), but neither of you can \u201cstay behind\u201d indefinitely or remain at a fixed radius to see the other\u2019s final moments from a \u201csafe\u201d vantage point. So yes, **any internal observer** who has crossed the horizon is effectively on the same journey to the singularity.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Observers Outside the Horizon Cannot See Inside\n\nObservers who remain *outside* the event horizon never actually see you cross it (from their perspective). Due to extreme gravitational time dilation near the horizon:\n\n- They observe you **slow down** as you approach the horizon and your signals become increasingly redshifted.  \n- They never see you *fully* cross in a finite external time\u2014your image fades, asymptotically approaching the horizon.  \n\nFurthermore, once you *are* behind the horizon, **information about your continued infall cannot escape** to the external Universe. So no external observer in the \u201csafe zone\u201d outside can watch you pass the horizon or hit the singularity.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Conclusion\n\n- **If the observer is outside the black hole:** They cannot see you actually fall through and reach the singularity. From their standpoint, you freeze asymptotically near the horizon.  \n- **If the observer is inside the black hole:** They are on the same unavoidable path to the singularity. There is no stable orbit or \u201csafe distance\u201d inside the event horizon.\n\nHence, there is **no scenario** in classical General Relativity where someone else inside the black hole remains at a permanent \u201csafe distance\u201d to watch you fall all the way to \\(r=0\\).

By \u201cglobal,\u201d we mean it depends on the entire evolution of spacetime\u2014specifically, whether light rays (or any signal) can escape to *infinity* in the far future.  \n- Consequently, there is **no purely local experiment** (done in a small lab over short times) that can definitively say, \u201cYes, I have crossed the horizon.\u201d In a sufficiently large black hole with weak tidal forces at the horizon, you might notice *no* dramatic effect while crossing.\n\nThat said, your question posits having an *extremely large* research facility (perhaps light-years across), equipped with the ability to make big, long-duration measurements. Under those idealized conditions, there **are** certain large-scale experiments and observations\u2014spanning large distances and long times\u2014that can *collectively* give you overwhelming evidence that you are inside the horizon.\n\nBelow are the main lines of reasoning/experiments one could employ.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Search for \u201cNo Escape\u201d Trajectories\n\n**Key physical feature inside an event horizon**:  \n- *All* future-directed paths (for massive or massless particles) lead inevitably to \\(r=0\\), the central singularity, in a Schwarzschild-like geometry.  \n- There is **no** physical trajectory by which you or your probes can remain at a fixed radius or move outward to larger \\(r\\).\n\n### 1.1 Attempting to Hover at a Fixed Radius\n- Outside a black hole, if you have sufficiently powerful rockets, you *can* hover at a given radius (though it might require extreme acceleration close to the horizon).  \n- **Inside** the horizon (\\(r < r_s\\) for Schwarzschild), no finite amount of rocket power can maintain a fixed \\(r\\). The radial coordinate \\(r\\) becomes *timelike*, meaning \u201cfalling inward\u201d is as inevitable as moving forward in time.  \n- **Experimental approach**: You would build massive rocket thrusters to try \u201cholding station\u201d at a given radius. If your thrusters saturate at some extreme limit yet you *still* measure that \\(r\\) continues to *decrease*, that\u2019s a strong sign you are inside the horizon.\n\n### 1.2 Launch Probes in All Directions\n- In normal space (outside a black hole), if you fire a sufficiently fast probe outward, you can confirm it escapes to large distances.  \n- **Inside the horizon**: No matter the direction or speed, geodesics (and thus physical probes) will fail to reach any \u201coutside world.\u201d They will ultimately be dragged deeper in.  \n- **Experimental approach**: Station an array of telescopes and receivers throughout your facility. Fire test probes (rockets, light signals) in every outward radial direction. If, even with maximum propulsion, *none* of these probes can be made to maintain or increase their radial coordinate\u2014and none ever returns a signal confirming \u201cI have escaped to infinity!\u201d\u2014that strongly indicates you are beyond the horizon.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify \u201cTrapped Surfaces\u201d\n\nInside a black hole, a common geometric description is that **all spheres are \u201ctrapped surfaces.\u201d** Roughly:\n\n- A \u201ctrapped surface\u201d is one where **outgoing** light rays (that try to expand the surface) actually *converge* rather than diverge as they move forward in time.  \n- Outside a horizon, if you flash light radially outward from a spherical shell, it expands outward indefinitely. Inside a horizon, even the outward-directed light cones ultimately collapse toward the singularity.\n\n### Experimental Idea\n1. Configure a spherical shell of synchronized lasers or flash bulbs.  \n2. Have each point on the sphere emit an outward flash at the same time.  \n3. Carefully track the wavefront using a surrounding network of sensors or smaller satellites.\n\nIf your measurements show that the outward wavefront *fails* to expand as expected\u2014and in fact is converging\u2014this is a \u201ctrapped surface\u201d signature. Such a large-scale measurement is **unambiguous evidence** that no signals can propagate out to large \\(r\\). You are, by definition, *inside* a region from which light cannot escape.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Inability to Signal \u201cOutside\u201d\n\nA huge research facility would likely include ways to communicate with hypothetical distant observers or known external beacons. Inside the horizon:\n\n1. **Outgoing signals never reach external observers.** Even if it appears to you that you are \u201csending\u201d them outward, they get turned around (in coordinate terms) or remain trapped.  \n2. You might still receive old signals (light, radio, etc.) from the outside Universe\u2014especially from events that happened outside *before* you crossed. But you can\u2019t get new replies from outside.  \n\nHence, **a persistent communications blackout** with the external Universe (beyond some radius) combined with confirmation that no method of boosting signal strength can re-establish contact is a practical demonstration you have passed beyond a one-way boundary: the event horizon.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Looking for the \u201cCoordinate Swap\u201d\n\nIn Schwarzschild coordinates, outside the horizon, \\(r\\) acts as a standard radial *spatial* coordinate and \\(t\\) is the *time* coordinate. **Inside** the horizon, effectively \\(r\\) becomes *timelike*, and \\(t\\) can become *spacelike*. \n\nWhile coordinates can be tricky in general relativity (they\u2019re not direct physical observables by themselves), large-scale surveys of geodesics and the local geometry can reveal that:\n\n- **Your \u201cradial direction\u201d behaves like time** (unstoppably increasing or decreasing),  \n- **Your old \u201ctime direction\u201d might admit freedom to move around** as though it\u2019s a spatial direction.\n\nIn principle, a sufficiently advanced research program in gravitational measurements (surveying curvature across a huge region) could:\n\n1. **Map out the Riemann curvature** in a 4D region around you.  \n2. Show that there is *no timelike Killing vector* that corresponds to \u201cstationary solutions,\u201d and that the coordinate that used to look purely spatial is actually aligning with your forward progress in time.  \n\nThis is highly technical, but in a \u201cfacility with every conceivable piece of equipment,\u201d such a study of the global geometry would be a sure sign you\u2019ve passed the horizon.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Tidal Forces and Infall Time Are Not Always Giveaways\n\n- For **stellar-mass** black holes, the horizon is small, so tidal forces (spacetime curvature) can be enormous near the horizon\u2014making it obvious you\u2019re in an extreme environment.  \n- For **supermassive** or \u201cgalaxy-scale\u201d black holes, the tidal forces at the horizon can be tiny, so you might not feel any \u201cspaghettification\u201d for a long time. Locally, small-scale experiments (like dropping objects or measuring local gravitational fields in a lab) might look almost normal.  \n\nThat\u2019s why truly *local* experiments are insufficient. You need the large-scale tests described above.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary of Experiments and Observational Clues\n\n1. **No Stationary Hover**  \n   - Attempt to \u201chold radius\u201d by using arbitrarily large rocket thrust. If it\u2019s impossible to avoid decreasing \\(r\\), that indicates you\u2019re inside.\n\n2. **No Escape for Probes**  \n   - Launch test probes in all directions (including radially outward). *None* can maintain or increase \\(r\\). Instead, all infall. \n\n3. **Trapped Surfaces**  \n   - Large-scale measurement of light fronts from spherical shells shows outward-directed light converges rather than expands.\n\n4. **Permanent Communication Blackout**  \n   - Attempts to re-contact external observers or beacons at large \\(r\\) fail\u2014no signal, no echo, no reply (beyond older signals that might still be traveling inward). \n\n5. **Global Curvature Survey**  \n   - Map the geometry extensively, looking for the signature that the radial coordinate has become timelike and the horizon is behind you. \n\nAny one of these on a small scale might be inconclusive; but in a huge, well-equipped facility that can attempt *all* of them (over large distances and times), you could accumulate overwhelming evidence that you are indeed *beyond* the event horizon\u2014and thus on an inevitable path to the singularity."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"02b8ba6d-9b04-4182-b6ed-3be0f986b03d","request_id":"91af9e594a51fdbb-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"02b8ba6d-9b04-4182-b6ed-3be0f986b03d","children":[]}}}
