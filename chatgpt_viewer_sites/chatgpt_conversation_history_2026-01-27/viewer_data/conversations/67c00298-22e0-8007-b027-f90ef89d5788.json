Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS) in Singapore is adjusted annually to align with the projected basic subsidised healthcare expenses for individuals aged 65 and above.\ue204 \ue203This adjustment ensures

5%.\ue204 \ue203For instance, in 2025, the BHS was set at $75,500, reflecting a 5.6% rise from the previous year's $71,500.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203Given this trend,
