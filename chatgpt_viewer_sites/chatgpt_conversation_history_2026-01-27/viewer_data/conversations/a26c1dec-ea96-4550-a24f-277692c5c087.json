This identity indeed arises from Pythagoras' Theorem when considering the definition of sine and cosine in terms of the unit circle.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how Pythagoras' Theorem underpins this identity:\n\n1. **Definition on the Unit Circle**: By definition, sine and cosine are initially determined using the right triangle formed by a radius of the unit circle, where the hypotenuse is 1 (the radius), and the other two sides are the lengths corresponding to the sine and cosine of the angle \\( B \\). Specifically, if an angle \\( B \\) is formed by a line rotating from the positive x-axis, then:\n   - \\( \\cos(B) \\) is the x-coordinate of the intersection point on the circle.\n   - \\( \\sin(B) \\) is the y-coordinate of the intersection point on the circle.\n\n2. **Unit Circle and Pythagoras' Theorem**: The equation of the unit circle is \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). For a point \\( (\\cos(B), \\sin(B)) \\) on the unit circle:\n   - Substitute \\( x \\) with \\( \\cos(B) \\) and \\( y \\) with \\( \\sin(B) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\cos^2(B) + \\sin^2(B) = 1\n     \\]\n   This relationship is a direct consequence of Pythagoras' Theorem applied to the triangle formed by the radius and the perpendicular dropped from the point on the circle to the x-axis.\n\n3. **SO(2) and Orthogonality**: To recognize \\( R_B \\) as a rotation matrix, it not only suffices to demonstrate that it preserves the circle's equation (as shown by the identity), but also its determinant must be 1 and it must preserve orthogonality. The latter conditions ensure that the transformation is length-preserving (isometric) and orientation-preserving (hence it belongs to the special orthogonal group \\( SO(2) \\)):\n   - The columns of \\( R_B \\) are orthogonal to each other and each has unit length (norm), satisfying \\( \\cos^2(B) + \\sin^2(B) = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, while the derivation of the compound angle formulas and the use of rotation matrices might not directly invoke Pythagoras' Theorem within the steps of their algebraic or geometric proofs, the foundational understanding of sine, cosine, and the properties of the unit circle and \\( SO(2) \\) are inherently rooted in Pythagorean principles."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","default_model_slug":"gpt-4","pad":"AAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa20110-94f1-4395-92c3-30383bddda8d","is_complete":true,"request_id":"8832fed9bd843f94-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa20110-94f1-4395-92c3-30383bddda8d","children":["aaa2fea5-c567-4db2-964c-c022c7c73714"]},"aaa2fea5-c567-4db2-964c-c022c7c73714":{"id":"aaa2fea5-c567-4db2-964c-c022c7c73714","message":{"id":"aaa2fea5-c567-4db2-964c-c022c7c73714","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1715607074.943371,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Since the derivation of the compound angle formulae depend on the geometric properties of the unit circle and the application or rotation matrices in SO(2), am I then right to say that Pythagoras' Theorem must first be proved in order for this subsequent theory to be developed?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"883301f81b6d4080-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d5803cfa-c66e-4357-9960-3ebcc02d8b03","children":["66e185e2-0514-4219-b842-31cfaeab67a5"]},"66e185e2-0514-4219-b842-31cfaeab67a5":{"id":"66e185e2-0514-4219-b842-31cfaeab67a5","message":{"id":"66e185e2-0514-4219-b842-31cfaeab67a5","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1715607107.279406,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yes, you are correct.

Proofs of Pythagoras' Theorem should ideally not depend on any advanced mathematics that itself depends on the theorem. Pythagoras' Theorem can and has been proven using basic geometric principles without resorting to trigonometry, which is a preferable approach in maintaining logical consistency.\n\n4. **Independent Proofs of Pythagoras' Theorem**: There are numerous proofs of Pythagoras' Theorem that rely purely on geometric constructions, algebraic manipulations, or properties of similar triangles, which do not invoke trigonometric identities. These provide a solid basis for the theorem independent of trigonometry.\n\nIn summary, any proof of Pythagoras' Theorem that uses trigonometric identities (like compound angle formulas) is problematic from a foundational perspective, as it depends on a framework that is itself based on Pythagoras' Theorem.

Let \\( \\vec{u} \\) represent \\( (\\cos A, \\sin A) \\) and \\( \\vec{v} \\) represent \\( (\\cos B, \\sin B) \\).\n   - Construct a parallelogram where \\( \\vec{u} \\) and \\( \\vec{v} \\) are adjacent sides.\n\n2. **Add Angles and Vectors**:\n   - The diagonal of the parallelogram, say \\( \\vec{d} \\), from point \\( O \\) to the opposite corner, represents the vector sum \\( \\vec{u} + \\vec{v} \\). The direction of \\( \\vec{d} \\) corresponds to the angle \\( A + B \\).\n\n3. **Resolve \\( \\vec{d} \\) into Components**:\n   - The horizontal component of \\( \\vec{d} \\) is \\( \\cos A \\cos B - \\sin A \\sin B \\) (resultant of horizontal components from \\( \\vec{u} \\) and \\( \\vec{v} \\)).\n   - The vertical component of \\( \\vec{d} \\) is \\( \\sin A \\cos B + \\cos A \\sin B \\) (resultant of vertical components from \\( \\vec{u} \\) and \\( \\vec{v} \\)).\n\n4. **Identify Compound Angle Formulas**:\n   - The horizontal component of \\( \\vec{d} \\) effectively gives the formula for \\( \\cos(A+B) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\cos(A+B) = \\cos A \\cos B - \\sin A \\sin B\n     \\]\n   - The vertical component of \\( \\vec{d} \\) gives the formula for \\( \\sin(A+B) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sin(A+B) = \\sin A \\cos B + \\cos A \\sin B\n     \\]\n\nThis geometric method leverages basic vector addition and the parallelogram law (which states that the sum of the vectors can be represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by these vectors), and it does not require direct use of the unit circle or rotation matrices.
