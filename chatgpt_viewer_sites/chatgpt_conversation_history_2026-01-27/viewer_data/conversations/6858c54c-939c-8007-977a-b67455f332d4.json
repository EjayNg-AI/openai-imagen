Here\u2019s a precise, objective overview:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Traditional Orthodox Jewish View (Pre-20th Century)**\n\n**Historically**, most Orthodox Jews\u2014especially the ultra-Orthodox (Haredim)\u2014*did not* support the idea of re-establishing a Jewish state through human action. Their opposition was based on classical Jewish teachings, particularly the *\u201cThree Oaths\u201d* (Talmud, Ketubot 111a):\n\n- Jews should not \u201cstorm the wall,\u201d i.e., collectively return to the Land of Israel by force.\n- They should not rebel against the nations.\n- The nations should not oppress the Jews excessively.\n\n**Implication:**  \nThe traditional view held that Jews should *wait for the Messiah* (the divinely sent redeemer) to restore the Jewish people to their land and rebuild the Temple. Human-initiated political Zionism was seen as, at best, premature and, at worst, a violation of divine will.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Orthodox Responses to Political Zionism (Late 19th\u201320th Century)**\n\n**Political Zionism**, led by mostly secular Jews (Herzl, Ben-Gurion, etc.), sought a Jewish state *as a national project*. Orthodox responses split into several camps:\n\n#### **A. Anti-Zionist Orthodox Jews**\n- **Neturei Karta** and some ultra-Orthodox groups still *vehemently* oppose the State of Israel.\n- They argue a Jewish state must wait for the Messiah, and that current Israel is a secular, even heretical, project.\n\n#### **B. Non-Zionist but Pragmatic**\n- Some Haredi communities (e.g., parts of Agudath Israel) initially *opposed* Zionism, but after the Holocaust and the founding of Israel, they chose to *work within the state* for practical benefits (education, community needs) without endorsing its ideological foundation.\n- Their participation is often conditional and reluctant.\n\n#### **C. Religious Zionists**\n- **Mizrachi**, **Religious Zionist**, or **Modern Orthodox** Jews reinterpret traditional texts to *support* Zionism.\n- They see the establishment of Israel as divinely ordained or as the \"beginning of redemption\" (*Atchalta De\u2019Geulah*), even if incomplete.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Contemporary Orthodox Positions**\n\n- **Ultra-Orthodox/Haredi**:  \n  - Range from outright anti-Zionism (e.g., Neturei Karta) to pragmatic engagement (Shas, Agudah) but with little religious fervor for the state itself.\n  - Many see the state as \u201cjust another government\u201d but may appreciate its benefits to Jewish life.\n  - Some segments have softened due to practical realities, but *do not* view the modern state as fulfilling messianic prophecy.\n\n- **Religious Zionists (Dati Leumi)**:  \n  - Actively support the state of Israel, often serving in the IDF and in state institutions.\n  - Theologically view the state\u2019s existence as a positive, even providential, development.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Summary Table**\n\n| Orthodox Group          | Support for Jewish State? | Rationale                                             |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Neturei Karta, Satmar  | No                       | Wait for Messiah, reject secular Zionism              |\n| Mainstream Haredim     | Reluctant/Pragmatic      | Not messianic, but accept reality for community needs |\n| Modern Orthodox/Mizrachi| Yes                      | Religious value, \u201cbeginning of redemption\u201d            |\n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line**\n\n- **It is true** that significant parts of Orthodox Judaism\u2014especially the most traditional and ultra-Orthodox elements\u2014have historically *not* wanted Jews to found or govern a country before the coming of the Messiah.\n- Today, views are split: Some remain opposed, some are pragmatic, and others are enthusiastic supporters of Israel on religious grounds.\n- **Orthodox Judaism is not monolithic**; attitudes toward Jewish statehood depend on theology, history, and current realities.\n\n---\n\nIf you want more detail on a particular group or the religious texts behind these positions, let me know."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"058d197a-558e-4774-b257-252b3678cf54","request_id":"9540c8bd99a12a90-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"058d197a-558e-4774-b257-252b3678cf54","children":["c1210639-1143-4c77-9840-7cc9bf417fa2"]},"c1210639-1143-4c77-9840-7cc9bf417fa2":{"id":"c1210639-1143-4c77-9840-7cc9bf417fa2","message":{"id":"c1210639-1143-4c77-9840-7cc9bf417fa2","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750648219.165,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["But this is about how they want to be treated, which is beyond their control"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"targeted_reply":"The nations should not oppress the Jews excessively.","request_id":"9540caa0ce169e22-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3ae2d034-24e3-4d3d-8f9d-64aa6fb53260","children":["57c888d4-f1a5-4b4d-914b-b918419708c9"]},"57c888d4-f1a5-4b4d-914b-b918419708c9":{"id":"57c888d4-f1a5-4b4d-914b-b918419708c9","message":{"id":"57c888d4-f1a5-4b4d-914b-b918419708c9","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750648218.161173,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"9540caa0ce169e22-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c1210639-1143-4c77-9840-7cc9bf417fa2","children":["790d3bd1-d64b-4257-8280-1fa911a2b259"]},"790d3bd1-d64b-4257-8280-1fa911a2b259":{"id":"790d3bd1-d64b-4257-8280-1fa911a2b259","message":{"id":"790d3bd1-d64b-4257-8280-1fa911a2b259","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750648218.260508,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Excellent observation\u2014and your interpretation is **correct**. The \"Three Oaths\" as presented in the Talmud do include one oath that is not about Jewish agency but about the *behavior of the nations* toward Jews:\n\n> **\u201cThe nations should not oppress the Jews excessively.\u201d**\n\nThis is not a command or aspiration for Jews themselves; it is, rather, a directive or condition imposed on the *nations of the world*. In other words, it stipulates an ideal or expectation regarding how Jews should be treated, but\u2014as you point out\u2014this is not something Jews themselves can enforce or fulfill.\n\n---\n\n### **Clarifying the Role of the Oaths**\n\n- The **first two oaths** are prescriptive toward Jewish agency:  \n  1. Jews should not ascend the wall (i.e., force a mass return to Israel).\n  2. Jews should not rebel against the nations.\n\n- The **third oath** (nations should not oppress Jews excessively)  \n  - Is *descriptive/prescriptive* for the nations, not the Jews.\n  - In practical terms, it\u2019s outside Jewish control.\n  - It establishes a kind of *reciprocal arrangement* in the rabbinic imagination: Jews do not \u201cforce the end,\u201d and nations do not persecute Jews beyond a certain limit.\n\n---\n\n### **Practical and Theological Implications**\n\n- Orthodox Jewish *opposition* to a pre-messianic state centers on the first two oaths\u2014their own behavior.\n- The *third oath* is often cited in rabbinic literature as evidence that Jewish suffering in exile has a \"limit,\" and that if the nations overstep, the covenant is violated (sometimes used to theologically justify divine intervention).\n- Many anti-Zionist rabbis *do not* claim that Jews are responsible for enforcing the third oath\u2014they reference it as a boundary or warning to the nations.\n\n---\n\n### **Forward-Looking Critique**\n\nYou\u2019ve pinpointed a weakness in the logic of those who cite all three oaths as a reason *against* Jewish statehood:  \n- Only the first two restrict Jewish agency.  \n- The third is a moral-imperative placed on others.\n\nWhen arguing from the perspective of the oaths, *only the oaths that restrict Jewish action are relevant to the question of Jewish political sovereignty or establishing a country.*\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou are right\u2014the third oath is not an instruction for Jewish conduct or a limit on what Jews \u201cshould want\u201d regarding statehood. It is a notional expectation directed at non-Jewish nations, not at Jews themselves. Any argument about what Jews should or should not do, or want, regarding statehood must be based on the oaths or teachings that address *Jewish agency*, not the behavior of others."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"57c888d4-f1a5-4b4d-914b-b918419708c9","request_id":"9540caa0ce169e22-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"57c888d4-f1a5-4b4d-914b-b918419708c9","children":[]}}}
