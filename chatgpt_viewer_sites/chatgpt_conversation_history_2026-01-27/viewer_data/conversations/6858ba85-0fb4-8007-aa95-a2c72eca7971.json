President Trump claimed these sites were \"completely obliterated\" and pressed Iran to make peace, warning of further action. However, experts, including James M. Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, criticized the action for its potential to provoke conflict and undermine previous diplomatic gains. Acton highlighted the possibility of Iran retaliating with missile strikes, withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and reconstituting its nuclear program more quickly than previously possible under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (J.C.P.O.A.).\n\nActon asserted that the Obama-era deal, which Trump abandoned in 2018, provided effective monitoring and constraints, arguing that military action exacerbates the risks by pushing Iran toward actual weaponization. He also emphasized that while Iran likely aimed to maintain nuclear weapon capability, U.S. intelligence indicated no active bomb-building program post-2003. The interview critiques the insufficient diplomatic window and warns that regime change\u2014an alleged goal of some Israeli actions\u2014might not resolve nuclear tensions, as Iran's nuclear ambition is deeply entrenched in its national identity.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750607224.938,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"obamawhitehouse.archives.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/node/328996","title":"The Historic Deal that Will Prevent Iran from Acquiring a Nuclear ...","snippet":"The Iran Deal blocks the four pathways to a nuclear weapon.

It's looking a lot like Obama's","snippet":"In recent months, the U.S., under President Donald Trump, has re-engaged in diplomatic talks with Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program, despite Trump having previously withdrawn from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) during his first term. That agreement, brokered during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, placed significant constraints on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, but was criticized for its sunset provisions and failure to address Iran\u2019s missile program or support for regional militant groups. Trump had vowed to negotiate a stronger deal, yet no progress occurred during his initial term. Now, three rounds of mostly indirect discussions\u2014mediated by Oman\u2014echo the original JCPOA framework, focusing exclusively on Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities. Critics note the similarity to the Obama-era deal, as issues like Tehran's regional proxies and missile program remain unaddressed. Though Iran faces economic hardship and weakened regional influence, it has strengthened ties with Russia and China through military cooperation and a long-term strategic agreement. As Iran broadens these alliances, experts argue the U.S. must work with international partners to ensure a robust and lasting diplomatic framework that cannot be easily undone, unlike the original deal Trump abandoned.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746100806.499,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6858ba9391188007a9d4d79f222bb776","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"6784a2ad-b2c2-4b3d-a8c4-670e4af4efb2","request_id":"9540855e9bb79c32-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6784a2ad-b2c2-4b3d-a8c4-670e4af4efb2","children":["3697323b-9cb4-46db-9c85-83c93be34714"]},"3697323b-9cb4-46db-9c85-83c93be34714":{"id":"3697323b-9cb4-46db-9c85-83c93be34714","message":{"id":"3697323b-9cb4-46db-9c85-83c93be34714","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750645409.494797,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"open\": [\n    {\n      \"ref_id\": \"turn0search4\",\n      \"lineno\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"723632b4-3895-4588-9509-fddab4239332","request_id":"9540855e9bb79c32-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"723632b4-3895-4588-9509-fddab4239332","children":["0471ddfe-d11c-40cd-8583-26ea5b6f79f9"]},"0471ddfe-d11c-40cd-8583-26ea5b6f79f9":{"id":"0471ddfe-d11c-40cd-8583-26ea5b6f79f9","message":{"id":"0471ddfe-d11c-40cd-8583-26ea5b6f79f9","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1750645410.9656787,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet","title":"Stuxnet -

Strategic aims and framing  \nFrom his first months in office (2009 \u2013 2017), President Barack Obama defined the Iranian nuclear issue as **the most urgent proliferation problem** and set two explicit red-lines: *no Iranian nuclear weapon* and *no war if diplomacy could avoid it*. He pursued a **\u201cdual-track\u201d** strategy\u2014offer dialogue while steadily tightening multilateral sanctions\u2014to create leverage for a negotiated cap on Iran\u2019s program.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Phase I (2009-2012): pressure plus covert disruption  \n\n| Policy lever | What Obama did | Effect by late 2012 |\n|--------------|----------------|---------------------|\n| **Engagement** | 2009 Nowruz message to Tehran; P5+1 talks | No breakthrough; Iran kept enriching |\n| **Covert action** | Continued the *Stuxnet* operation with Israel, physically damaging Natanz centrifuges \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201 | Set Iran\u2019s program back ~9\u201315 months but exposed US\u2013Israel cyber playbook |\n| **Sanctions** | Signed executive orders/NDAA amendments cutting Iran from oil & banking markets \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 | Crude-oil exports fell \u226550 %, the rial collapsed, inflation spiked |\n\n**Assessment.**  Pressure created real economic pain and delayed technical progress, but also hardened Iranian bargaining positions and risked escalation (Hormuz threats, 2011 assassination plot in DC).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Phase II (2013-Jan 2016): negotiation and the JCPOA  \n\n1. **Secret Oman channel (early 2013)** laid groundwork for diplomacy once Hasan Rouhani, a self-styled pragmatist, was elected.  \n2. **Joint Plan of Action (JPA, Nov 2013)** froze key activities and promised limited sanctions relief.  \n3. **JCPOA (July 2015)**\u2014key provisions:  \n   * Stockpile cut from ~10 000 kg to 300 kg; Fordow converted to research use.  \n   * Only 5 060 IR-1 centrifuges allowed; advanced machines mothballed.  \n   * Arak heavy-water reactor cored and filled with concrete.  \n   * **24/7 IAEA access plus continuous online monitoring**; snap-back of U.N. sanctions for cheating \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201.  \n\nObama argued the deal **blocked all four pathways** (Natanz/Fordow enrichment, Arak plutonium, covert \u201csneak-out\u201d) and pushed *break-out time* from 2-3 months to \u226512 months \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Verification record through Obama\u2019s final year  \nThe IAEA\u2019s December 2016 report confirmed Iran was meeting every nuclear commitment (centrifuge caps, uranium shipping, Arak redesign) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.  No significant violations were cited while Obama was in office.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Domestic & regional politics  \n* **Congress.**  The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) forced 60-day scrutiny; JCPOA survived but only because a filibuster blocked a disapproval resolution\u2014hardly a bipartisan mandate.  \n* **Israel & Gulf partners.**  They accepted tougher inspections but condemned the deal\u2019s *sunset clauses* and its silence on ballistic missiles and regional proxy warfare.  \n* **Europe, Russia, China.**  Valued the deal and unified sanctions regime; worried US credibility would suffer if Washington walked away.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Strengths of Obama\u2019s approach  \n\n| Metric | Pre-deal (2013) | Post-Implementation Day (Jan 2016) | Strategic value |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Enriched U stockpile | ~10 000 kg (3.5 %) | \u2264 300 kg (3.67 %) | Removes quick \u201cfeed-stock\u201d |\n| Operating centrifuges | ~19 ,000 | 5 ,060 IR-1 | Cuts enrichment capacity > \u2154 |\n| Break-out estimate | 2-3 months | \u226512 months | Buys time for detection & response |\n| Monitoring | Basic safeguards | Continuous cameras, SF-PIMS seals, procurement channel | Raises detection probability |\n\n* **Coalition cohesion.**  Kept EU-3 + Russia + China aligned\u2014rare in great-power politics.  \n* **Avoided war.**  Combined sanctions + diplomacy achieved constraints without kinetic strikes, an explicit Obama goal.  \n* **Reversibility for pressure.**  \u201cSnap-back\u201d mechanism provided a legal route to restore U.N. sanctions instantly if Iran cheated\u2014leverage Trump later ignored.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Key weaknesses & critiques  \n\n1. **Sunset provisions.**  Restrictions on advanced centrifuges and enrichment start phasing out after years 8, 10, 15, allowing a latent industrial-scale program later \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn4search3\ue201.  \n2. **Missile & regional behavior excluded.**  JCPOA left Iran\u2019s ballistic-missile work, militias (Hezbollah, Houthis, IRGC-QF) and human-rights record untouched\u2014fueling allies\u2019 fear that sanctions relief would underwrite aggression.  \n3. **Sanctions unwind complexity.**  Once major sanctions were lifted, re-imposing them proved politically and commercially difficult (a flaw Trump exploited by quitting the deal outright in 2018).  \n4. **Domestic legitimacy gap.**  Lack of Senate ratification and near-total GOP opposition made the accord fragile\u2014an executive agreement rather than treaty.  \n\n---\n\n### 8. Covert track\u2014useful but risky  \nStuxnet\u2019s sabotage bought valuable time but **normalised offensive cyber as a non-declared tool of statecraft**, prompting copy-cat interest and eroding norms \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201.  Obama never publicly acknowledged the operation, but it fit the broader \u201cpressure-while-negotiating\u201d calculus.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Overall balance sheet  \n\n| **Positives** | **Negatives** |\n|---------------|---------------|\n| Pushed weaponisation risk a decade off and installed toughest inspection regime ever negotiated with a non-nuclear-weapon NPT state. | Temporary nature; ignored missiles and regional adventurism; politically reversible in Washington. |\n| Demonstrated that economic coercion + diplomacy can change Iranian cost\u2013benefit calculus without war. | Relief cash + market re-entry arguably emboldened IRGC regional footprint. |\n| Preserved great-power unity at a time of growing US-Russia-China rivalry. | Deal relied on continued US participation; once withdrawn in 2018, safeguards frayed and Iran ramped enrichment. |\n\n**Net judgment.**  *Technically*, Obama\u2019s policy worked: Iran\u2019s nuclear progress was sharply limited at tolerable strategic cost through 2016.  *Politically*, it was brittle, lacking bipartisan buy-in and a regional security complement.  The Trump withdrawal exposed those seams; Iran now enriches far beyond JCPOA limits, illustrating both the deal\u2019s utility when in force and its vulnerability when not embedded in a broader consensus.\n\n---\n\n### 10. Forward-looking lessons  \n\n1. **Linkage matters.**  A sustainable bargain must marry nuclear restrictions to regional de-escalation and missile limits to satisfy Middle-East partners.  \n2. **Build domestic coalitions early.**  Future presidents should seek at least a congressional \u201cexecutive agreement plus\u201d vote to outlast partisan swings.  \n3. **Design phased but conditional sunsets.**  Each expiry should trigger *earned* benefits tied to continued compliance and broader behavior, not automatic lapses.  \n4. **Cyber norms need urgent attention.**  Stuxnet-style attacks have proliferated; without guardrails, retaliatory spirals around nuclear infrastructure grow likely.  \n5. **Prepare Plan B while pursuing Plan A.**  Deterrence, interdiction and economic levers must remain credible, or diplomacy loses bite.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear policy was a high-risk, high-reward bet on diplomacy backed by unprecedented sanctions and covert action.  It **bought a decade of restraint and transparency**, but its limited scope and shaky political foundations meant the gains were *reversible*\u2014a cautionary tale for future non-proliferation efforts."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201","start_idx":840,"end_idx":857,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"],"refs":[],"alt":"([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Stuxnet -

Bush's 2003 invasion of Iraq and Donald Trump's involvement in the 2025 Israel-Iran conflict, both of which were predicated on questionable intelligence. Bazzi recalls how the Bush administration falsely linked Saddam Hussein to weapons of mass destruction and the September 11 attacks, leading to a protracted and destructive war. Similarly, President Trump recently supported Israel's surprise strikes on Iran, which began on June 13, 2025, resulting in widespread destruction, including U.S. bombings of Iranian nuclear sites. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu claimed Iran was close to a nuclear bomb, but U.S. intelligence and the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency have found no credible evidence of Iran actively developing nuclear weapons. Bazzi critiques Netanyahu\u2019s decades-long campaign of exaggerating Iran\u2019s nuclear threat and influencing U.S. policy, citing his persistent claims dating back to the early 1990s. The article argues that Trump, driven by manipulated intelligence and misguided rhetoric, has repeated Bush's mistake, sparking a conflict with potentially devastating consequences for the Middle East.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750622447.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/23/sanctions-spark-war-words-tehran-washington","title":"Iran oil sanctions spark war of words between Tehran and Washington","snippet":"Brussels stressed that the punitive measures were aimed at forcing Iran back to the negotiating table over its suspect nuclear projects.

President Donald Trump announced the strikes, hailing them as a military success and warning Iran against retaliation, signaling the US could target additional sites. The strikes marked a shift in previously hesitant US policy, striving to neutralize Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which Iran insists is for peaceful purposes. Iran condemned the action as a grave breach of international law and warned of repercussions, placing its military on alert and voting to potentially close the vital Strait of Hormuz, threatening global oil trade. Israel responded by striking multiple Iranian military targets and reaffirmed its goal of eliminating perceived existential threats from Iran. The international community, including the UN, EU, China, and Russia, called for restraint and diplomatic engagement to prevent further escalation.

The worm infiltrates through network gateways and remains hidden in a computer's memory, making it difficult to detect. The U.S. accused Israel of spying on the Iran talks in March 2015, although Israel denied involvement in this recent attack. Experts, including Symantec and Trend Micro, confirmed that the attack has hallmarks of a nation-state operation, primarily targeting systems with valuable data.

Political discontent has been growing as Iranians grapple with economic hardship worsened by sanctions and inflation. The recent attacks have deepened this crisis, leading to infrastructure shutdowns and further erosion of public confidence.\n\nReformist President Masoud Pezeshkian\u2019s failure to secure sanctions relief has empowered hard-liners, yet their credibility is also eroding.

These attacks, aided by deep Israeli intelligence penetration, have exposed internal vulnerabilities and weakened the centuries-old power structure. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is scrambling to restore public trust amid significant military losses and intelligence failures, while state propaganda attempts to mitigate the damage with unverified claims of arresting Mossad-linked operatives.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed resistance, although his leadership appears increasingly fragile, especially given the lack of a clear succession plan following the death of his presumed successor, Ebrahim Raisi. Political discontent has been growing as Iranians grapple with economic hardship worsened by sanctions and inflation. The recent attacks have deepened this crisis, leading to infrastructure shutdowns and further erosion of public confidence.\n\nReformist President Masoud Pezeshkian\u2019s failure to secure sanctions relief has empowered hard-liners, yet their credibility is also eroding. With ethnic tensions simmering and leadership legitimacy declining, analysts warn that Iran could face fragmentation or military rule if Khamenei dies during the conflict.

The incident draws parallels to past Mossad operations dating back to 2010, which included the high-profile assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020 using an AI-assisted remote weapon. Additional earlier killings used similar covert tactics, often involving roadside or vehicular bombs. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the latest actions as essential for national security. In response, Tehran has declared upcoming US-Iran nuclear talks meaningless.

The 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JPCOA), aimed to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. The deal was negotiated to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, reducing its enriched uranium stockpile, and allowing extensive international monitoring.\n\nPresident Donald Trump criticized the agreement, labeling it poorly designed and non-permanent. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated the sanctions aim to alter Iran's behavior and halt its support for terrorist activities.\n\nThe reinstated sanctions target Iran's energy, shipping, and banking sectors. The U.S. granted waivers to eight countries allowing them to purchase Iranian oil under conditions.

In exchange for these constraints, Iran will gain increased regional leverage, significant financial benefits from the release of frozen assets, and, eventually, the ability to purchase conventional arms. The deal aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, a region that has seen significant conflict partly fueled by Iran and its involvement in supporting various groups viewed unfavorably by the U.S., such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Critics fear the agreement could spark a nuclear arms race, especially with Saudi Arabia indicating it will not tolerate Iran's enhanced nuclear capabilities. The deal's success hinges on consistent international monitoring and enforcement. Although it represents a gamble, the Obama administration views it as a necessary measure to maintain regional stability and prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapon status.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1437041465.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6858ba9391188007a9d4d79f222bb776","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"d43032cd-8087-4b9f-b70f-16d71aff7913","request_id":"95408c574d579c32-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d43032cd-8087-4b9f-b70f-16d71aff7913","children":["e2acdc4e-8bec-48ff-b9d0-3fc9c1cdbb69"]},"e2acdc4e-8bec-48ff-b9d0-3fc9c1cdbb69":{"id":"e2acdc4e-8bec-48ff-b9d0-3fc9c1cdbb69","message":{"id":"e2acdc4e-8bec-48ff-b9d0-3fc9c1cdbb69","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750645718.21152,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing Obama's policies and Iranian bargaining stance","content":"Obama's actions contributed significantly to Iran hardening its position in negotiations.

Recent Israeli strikes have devastated Iran\u2019s military leadership, including the head of the ballistic missile program, prompting daily retaliatory missile attacks from the IRGC. The IRGC\u2019s influence stems from both military might and economic entrenchment; it controls major sectors such as oil, construction, and telecommunications, and maintains vast social networks through the Basij paramilitary force. With Supreme Leader Khamenei\u2019s rule heavily reliant on the Guard\u2019s loyalty, a power vacuum following his potential fall may enable the IRGC to install a successor and tighten its grip on the country. The Guard, forged in the wake of Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution and the brutal Iran-Iraq War, is ideologically driven and structured to withstand both civil unrest and external threats. Despite sanctions and leadership losses, the IRGC's internal cohesion and integration into Iranian society make it resilient. Experts warn that rather than liberal reform, a regime change could usher in a more militant and reactionary government dominated by the Guard, further intensifying anti-Western and anti-Israeli stances.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750381200.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.cfr.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/irans-revolutionary-guards","title":"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)","snippet":"Some analysts say that the spate of U.S. sanctions has benefited the IRGC at the expense of Iran's public and broader economy; as Iranian ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749772800.0,"attribution":"www.cfr.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"home.treasury.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0177","title":"Treasury Designates the IRGC under Terrorism Authority and ...","snippet":"The IRGC has provided material support to the IRGC-QF, including by providing training, personnel, and military equipment.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1507852800.0,"attribution":"home.treasury.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm780","title":"Treasury Sanctions Iran's Central Bank and National Development ...","snippet":"Since at least 2016, the IRGC-QF has received the vast majority of its foreign currency from the CBI and senior CBI officials have worked ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1568937600.0,"attribution":"home.treasury.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"foreignpolicy.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/11/03/did-iran-sanctions-make-the-revolutionary-guard-stronger/","title":"Did Iran Sanctions Make the Revolutionary Guard Stronger?","snippet":"The piece points to evidence that the IRGC was able to cement its privileged position because it was the entity most capable of evading ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1509667200.0,"attribution":"foreignpolicy.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.brandeis.edu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/middle-east-briefs/meb160.html","title":"IRGC and Terrorism-Related Sanctions: Why They Fail, What They ...","snippet":"Sanctions have had a negative impact on the IRGC's domestic and mostly civilian business operations, and thereby on Iran's economy as a whole.

Though initially sidelined by President Donald Trump, who lifted sanctions on Syria and pursued diplomacy with Iran, Netanyahu\u2019s long-held objective of a U.S. military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities was ultimately realized. This reflects a pattern seen throughout Netanyahu's career: regardless of strained personal relationships with leaders like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Trump, U.S. military and diplomatic support for Israel has persisted. Notable conflicts include Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal, which Netanyahu vehemently opposed, yet U.S. aid continued with a record $38 billion package in 2016. Even under Biden, support temporarily waned due to concerns over Gaza and Israeli settler violence, but improved significantly following Trump's reelection. Netanyahu capitalized on this moment to push for U.S. participation in strikes against Iran, which Trump eventually authorized. This instance exemplifies Netanyahu\u2019s enduring influence over U.S. Middle East policy, sustained by deep-rooted American political and community backing, despite frequent personal and political frictions.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750591248.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.iaea.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/25/06/gov2025-24.pdf","title":"[PDF] Verification and monitoring in the Islamic Republic of Iran in light of ...","snippet":"...

His approach emphasizes collaboration with local forces and using U.S. troops primarily as strategic sensors and support, minimizing the need for large troop deployments.

That success was significant\u2014but because it was not embedded in a wider regional settlement or bipartisan consensus, its gains proved **reversible** once a successor chose withdrawal.
