In 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to Singapore elevated ties to an \u201cAll-Round Cooperative Partnership Progressing with the Times,\u201d leading to multi-faceted cooperation aligned with both countries\u2019 priorities\u30104\u2020L57-L65\u3011. By 2018, Singapore and China concluded an upgrade of their free trade agreement, further liberalizing market access\u301028\u2020L272-L279\u3011. Notably, since 2013 China has been Singapore\u2019s largest trading partner, while Singapore became China\u2019s largest foreign investor\u301028\u2020L272-L279\u3011. Major government-led projects \u2013 from the 1990s\u2019 Suzhou Industrial Park to the Tianjin Eco-City (2008) and Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (2015) \u2013 illustrate deepening economic and urban-development collaboration\u301028\u2020L285-L293\u3011. Even during challenges (e.g. the 2016 South China Sea strains or the COVID-19 pandemic), Singapore and China maintained dialogue and practical cooperation (launching a \u201cfast lane\u201d for essential travel in 2020, China\u2019s first such arrangement in Southeast Asia\u301028\u2020L299-L307\u3011). In April 2023, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s visit to Beijing saw relations formally upgraded to an **\u201cAll-Round High-Quality Future-Oriented Partnership,\u201d** affirming a long-term, strategic outlook for even closer ties\u30104\u2020L67-L75\u3011. This historical foundation of trust and engagement positions Singapore to pursue bold new initiatives with China \u2013 but always with an eye on regional stability and the U.S.-China balance.\n\n## Expanding Economic Cooperation with China  \nDeepening economic ties is a win-win priority. Robust trade and investment links already exist \u2013 China has been Singapore\u2019s top trade partner for 11 years running, with bilateral trade reaching over US$108 billion in 2023\u301017\u2020L148-L155\u3011. Singapore in turn remains a leading foreign investor in China\u301028\u2020L272-L279\u3011. To build on this base, Singapore can pursue several strategies:  \n\n- **Upgrade and Leverage Trade Agreements:** Finalize the ongoing upgrade of the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement to further ease market access and reduce barriers\u30104\u2020L84-L92\u3011. Actively implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and champion the proposed ASEAN-China Free Trade Area \u201c3.0\u201d upgrade\u30104\u2020L105-L113\u3011, ensuring Singapore and China both benefit from greater regional integration.  \n- **High-Quality Belt and Road Collaboration:** Align Singapore\u2019s infrastructure and finance expertise with China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. Singapore should participate only in **\u201chigh-quality\u201d BRI projects** \u2013 emphasizing transparency, sustainability, and local benefits\u30104\u2020L78-L86\u3011 \u2013 to ensure positive outcomes. For example, expand the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative\u2019s \u201cNew International Land-Sea Trade Corridor,\u201d enhancing rail-sea linkages from Western China through Singapore. This boosts trade flow while showcasing Singapore as an indispensable logistics and financial hub for BRI.  \n- **Green and Digital Economy Partnerships:** Prioritize cooperation in emerging sectors like renewable energy, sustainable urban solutions, and the digital economy. Both governments have agreed to **\u201cbroaden and deepen\u201d cooperation in green development and digital transformation\u30104\u2020L94-L100\u3011**, and President Xi himself urged seizing opportunities in digital and green development during meetings with Singaporean leaders\u301017\u2020L99-L107\u3011. Singapore can launch joint initiatives in areas such as smart cities (building on the Guangzhou Knowledge City and Shenzhen Smart City projects), fintech and e-commerce platforms, and cross-border digital trade frameworks. This aligns with Chinese experts\u2019 views that **digital trade, e-commerce, biotechnology, and smart cities** are promising areas for further cooperation\u301017\u2020L158-L162\u3011.  \n- **Financial Collaboration and RMB Internationalization:** Enhance Singapore\u2019s role as a financial bridge. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and People\u2019s Bank of China should deepen cooperation on RMB clearing and fintech innovation, leveraging Singapore\u2019s status as a major offshore RMB hub. For instance, with Singapore holding the lion\u2019s share of ASEAN\u2019s offshore RMB deposits, both sides can introduce new financing facilities for Belt-and-Road projects and green bonds in Singapore\u30104\u2020L119-L124\u3011. Such moves support China\u2019s internationalization of the renminbi while reinforcing Singapore\u2019s position as a trusted financial center for Chinese businesses.  \n- **Mutual Investment and Innovation:** Encourage two-way investments in high-tech and strategic industries. Singapore can attract Chinese tech firms and startups to set up regional headquarters or R&D centers in Singapore, creating jobs and knowledge transfer, while Singaporean companies (e.g. in finance, logistics, healthcare) can be supported to expand in China\u2019s vast market. Regular high-level economic dialogues (through platforms like the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation) should set targets for investment growth in sectors of mutual interest, and resolve any market access issues. This ensures Singapore remains **\u201ca pioneer in cooperation with China\u201d** on economic modernization\u301017\u2020L90-L98\u3011, reinforcing its value as an economic partner.\n\nBy executing these economic strategies, Singapore positions itself as an essential node in China\u2019s economic network, **actively participating in China\u2019s modernization journey**\u301017\u2020L121-L127\u3011 while securing growth opportunities for Singaporeans. Crucially, all economic initiatives should be pursued in an open, inclusive manner consistent with international rules \u2013 sending a message that deeper Singapore-China ties will **\u201cmaintain an open and inclusive global economy\u201d** beneficial to all\u30104\u2020L119-L124\u3011, rather than forming exclusive blocs.\n\n## Strengthening Cultural and People-to-People Bonds  \nSingapore\u2019s unique cultural position \u2013 a majority ethnic Chinese society that is multiracial, bilingual (English-Mandarin), and globally connected \u2013 makes it an invaluable cultural bridge to China. Both countries recognize that robust people-to-people ties form the **\u201ccornerstone\u201d** of a strong bilateral relationship\u301020\u2020L191-L198\u3011. Recent policies already reflect this: in December 2023, Singapore and China agreed to a **mutual 30-day visa-free travel arrangement** to boost tourism, family visits, and exchanges, to be implemented in early 2024\u301020\u2020L165-L172\u3011. Building on this momentum, Singapore can implement several measures to solidify its role as an indispensable cultural partner to China:  \n\n- **Promote Tourism and Travel Exchanges:** With China restoring visa-free entry for Singaporeans and vice versa\u301020\u2020L165-L172\u3011, both sides should facilitate a rebound (and expansion) of travel links to pre-pandemic levels and beyond. This means working with airlines to increase direct flights and routes between Chinese cities and Singapore, making travel more convenient. More tourist flows will spur interpersonal understanding and economic activity. Deputy PM Lawrence Wong noted that flights have already nearly reached pre-COVID levels, and the visa-free deal will **\u201cpromote more personnel exchanges and strengthen the cornerstone of bilateral relations\u201d**\u301020\u2020L191-L198\u3011. Each country could also launch tourism campaigns highlighting cultural attractions \u2013 from Singapore\u2019s multicultural heritage sites to China\u2019s historical landmarks \u2013 to encourage mutual visits.  \n- **Educational and Youth Exchanges:** Deepen educational linkages by expanding scholarship and exchange programs for students and young professionals. Singapore\u2019s schools and universities (many of which teach Mandarin as a second language) can twin or partner with Chinese institutions for immersion programs, joint degrees, and research collaborations. Likewise, invite more Chinese students to study in Singapore and vice versa. Such exchanges build lifelong connections and goodwill. Singapore might also offer more training programmes for Chinese officials and business leaders; since the mid-1990s, **over 50,000 Chinese officials have come to Singapore for study visits and training** in governance and public administration\u301028\u2020L290-L297\u3011 \u2013 a remarkable contribution to China\u2019s capacity building that should continue in updated forms (e.g. smart city governance, public health).  \n- **Cultural Festivals and Institutions:** Position Singapore as a hub for cultural exchange between China and Southeast Asia. This could include co-organizing annual Singapore-China cultural festivals featuring art exhibitions, film screenings, food fairs, and performances that celebrate the heritage of both nations. Singapore already hosts a Chinese Cultural Centre and various Chinese heritage festivals; these can be elevated to bilateral or regional events with China\u2019s participation. Similarly, encourage more collaboration in media and entertainment \u2013 for instance, joint film productions or TV documentaries about each other\u2019s cultures \u2013 to reach wider audiences. Such soft power diplomacy nurtures mutual understanding at the societal level.  \n- **Diaspora and Community Links:** Leverage the extensive personal ties between Singaporeans and Chinese. Many Singaporeans have family roots in southern China, and a growing community of Chinese expatriates and firms reside in Singapore. The government can facilitate community programs that bring these groups together, such as business networking events, community service projects, or forums where Chinese living in Singapore share experiences with locals. By acting as a welcoming host to Chinese talent and businesses, Singapore signals its openness as a cultural and intellectual partner.  \n- **Language and Talent Development:** Invest in language and cultural proficiency. Encourage more Singaporeans to learn Chinese language and cultural skills (beyond the ethnic Chinese community) while also promoting English language training in China through Singaporean institutions. This two-way language bridge is a strategic asset: it ensures that Singaporeans can engage deeply with China\u2019s society, and helps Chinese businesses and officials interface with the English-speaking world via Singapore. Singapore could establish a **\u201cSingapore-China Friendship Scholarship\u201d** for youths to study each other\u2019s country and serve as future ambassadors of goodwill.\n\nBy enriching these people-to-people ties, Singapore solidifies its image in China as a familiar, **trustworthy friend with shared cultural touchstones** \u2013 not just another foreign state. Over time, this cultural affinity will make China more inclined to engage Singapore deeply on all fronts, knowing that Singaporeans understand and respect Chinese culture (while offering a distinctly global perspective). It\u2019s a subtle but powerful form of diplomacy that complements economic and political cooperation.\n\n## Advancing Technological and Innovation Collaboration  \nTechnology and innovation are frontier areas where Singapore and China can greatly expand cooperation. China\u2019s rapid advances in areas like digital platforms, AI, and green tech complement Singapore\u2019s ambitions to be a Smart Nation and global innovation hub. Both governments have highlighted these as priority domains \u2013 Singapore and China agreed to **\u201charness synergies in new fields like digital transformation\u201d** and unlock growth opportunities for the future\u30104\u2020L94-L100\u3011. To position Singapore as an indispensable technological partner, a multi-pronged approach can be taken:  \n\n- **Joint Innovation Projects:** Establish bilateral R&D initiatives and innovation funds targeting cutting-edge tech sectors. For example, create a Singapore-China \u201cInnovation Incubator\u201d program that brings together startups and researchers from both sides to work on AI applications, biotech, semiconductor design, or sustainability solutions. This could be facilitated through existing frameworks like the Guangzhou Knowledge City, expanding beyond urban solutions into broader tech development. Both countries could co-fund research labs (in Singapore and in China) focusing on shared challenges such as green energy, climate resilience, or public health technology.  \n- **Smart Cities and Digital Infrastructure:** Build on the successful smart-city collaborations. The **Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative** and the flagship Suzhou Industrial Park (now a high-tech innovation base) are templates for how knowledge-sharing can drive urban and digital development\u301017\u2020L101-L109\u3011. Singapore can export its expertise in urban planning, fintech regulation, and digital government services, while tapping into China\u2019s strengths in scale, manufacturing, and rapid deployment. Future projects could include developing \u201csmart ports\u201d and secure trade digitalization between Singapore\u2019s port and China\u2019s Belt and Road nodes, enhancing supply chain efficiency.  \n- **Fintech and Financial Technology:** Deepen collaboration in fintech, where Singapore is a regional leader and China is a global fintech powerhouse. Regulators (MAS and PBoC) could run regulatory sandboxes together for innovations like central bank digital currencies or cross-border mobile payments that link Singapore\u2019s e-payments network with China\u2019s (e.g. enabling easier use of Alipay/WeChat Pay in Singapore and vice versa). By coordinating on fintech standards and **reviewing RMB clearing arrangements in Singapore\u301033\u2020L4-L8\u3011**, both sides support the international use of China\u2019s currency while reinforcing trust in Singapore\u2019s financial system.  \n- **Talent and Knowledge Exchange in Tech:** Facilitate movement of tech talent and ideas. Singapore can invite leading Chinese tech companies (Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, etc.) to set up research or training centers in Singapore, contributing to the local innovation ecosystem. In parallel, Singaporean tech entrepreneurs and scientists should be encouraged (with government support or incentives) to engage with China\u2019s vast tech market \u2013 whether through joint ventures in Shenzhen and Hangzhou or participating in China\u2019s tech conferences and incubators. A bilateral \u201ctech visa\u201d scheme or expansion of the visa-free travel arrangement to longer-term tech exchanges could ease such mobility. This two-way flow cements Singapore as the gateway for Chinese tech into global markets and for global (including U.S.) tech engagement with China, with Singapore acting as a neutral test-bed for interoperability.  \n- **Standards and Governance Collaboration:** Work together on international tech governance. Singapore consistently advocates for frameworks in cyber security and AI ethics, and it can play a convening role to bring China into these conversations constructively. Regular bilateral dialogues on data governance, AI regulation, and digital trade rules will help bridge differences between China\u2019s approach and that of Western countries. If Singapore and China can find common ground \u2013 for instance, on AI safety standards or norms for cyber behavior \u2013 Singapore\u2019s voice as a mediator in global tech forums will be strengthened, and China gains assurance that Singapore respects its perspective. This cooperative standard-setting can ensure that technological exchange does not compromise Singapore\u2019s security, and instead creates mutual benefits.\n\nBy proactively engaging China on innovation, Singapore benefits from early access to new technologies and funding, while China benefits from Singapore\u2019s stable business climate and international connections. Both can co-create solutions that may eventually be exported to the region, making **Singapore a showcase partner in China\u2019s tech-driven growth**. Importantly, Singapore should maintain a calibrated approach \u2013 welcoming Chinese tech collaboration in areas that are economic and civilian, while being cautious on sensitive security-related tech (to avoid triggering U.S. concerns or compromising its own defense). This careful vetting ensures **technology ties blossom in a way consistent with Singapore\u2019s security needs and neutrality.**\n\n## Positioning Singapore as China\u2019s Invaluable Partner  \nThrough the above economic, cultural, and technological initiatives, Singapore can deliberately shape Beijing\u2019s perception of the city-state as an **invaluable partner**. The goal is for Chinese leaders and businesses to see Singapore not just as another trade partner, but as a unique stakeholder in China\u2019s success \u2013 a country that can be a **trusted interlocutor, a source of expertise, and a bridge to the wider world**. Key steps to entrench this positioning include:  \n\n- **High-Level Engagement and Strategic Alignment:** Continue frequent high-level exchanges to build personal rapport and strategic alignment. In 2024, China and Singapore celebrated 35 years of diplomatic relations with multiple visits \u2013 e.g. Senior Minister (former PM) Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s visit to Beijing, where President Xi called for intensifying exchanges and **\u201cfurther align development strategies\u201d**\u301017\u2020L98-L106\u3011. Such visits should remain regular, including annual leadership summits or a formal \u201cleaders\u2019 retreat.\u201d These interactions allow Singapore to consistently demonstrate its value by offering candid advice and insights into regional affairs. Singapore\u2019s leaders can also articulate how Singapore\u2019s own national strategies (Smart Nation, Green Plan, etc.) dovetail with initiatives like China\u2019s Five-Year Plans or Belt and Road. When China sees Singapore\u2019s development as complementary to its own, it will naturally invest more attention and resources in the partnership.  \n- **Demonstrating Reliability and Trust:** Uphold a consistent, principled foreign policy that reassures China of Singapore\u2019s reliability. Singapore has shown that while it won\u2019t always agree with major powers, it is **predictable and fair**. For example, Singapore supported international law in the South China Sea but also engaged China respectfully through ASEAN, earning Beijing\u2019s appreciation that *\u201cSingapore needed to balance its relations\u201d* and wasn\u2019t acting against China\u30109\u2020L691-L699\u3011\u30109\u2020L692-L700\u3011. By staying **\u201cprincipled and consistent\u201d** \u2013 *\u201cWe do not take sides, we uphold principles\u201d*, as Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan says\u301025\u2020L19-L27\u3011 \u2013 Singapore proves itself a trustworthy partner whose positions are based on long-term rules, not fickle alignment. This builds Beijing\u2019s confidence that deepening ties with Singapore does not carry the risk of betrayal or oscillation; Singapore will remain a friend to all who respect sovereignty and law.  \n- **Serving as China\u2019s Gateway to ASEAN and the World:** Proactively offer Singapore\u2019s networks as a service to China\u2019s engagement of the region. Singapore can position itself as the hub for China within ASEAN \u2013 e.g. hosting regional headquarters for Chinese companies and banks, facilitating China-ASEAN dialogue (with Singapore playing coordinator roles in ASEAN when appropriate), and championing projects that link China with Southeast Asia (such as the Singapore-Kunming Rail connectivity vision). Already, as an ASEAN member, Singapore often represents **common ASEAN aspirations to cooperate with partners including China** on regional supply chains and stability\u301017\u2020L169-L177\u3011. By doing so, Singapore multiplies its value to China: it\u2019s not just 5.5 million Singaporeans that China engages, but the broader Southeast Asian market and beyond, with Singapore as the conduit. Similarly, on the global stage, Singapore\u2019s respected voice in forums like the UN, WTO, and G20 can echo shared concerns (e.g. advocating for multilateralism and against protectionism\u30104\u2020L113-L121\u3011) in ways that amplify China\u2019s messages in a palatable, non-threatening tone.  \n- **Highlighting Cultural Affinity and Social Ties:** Continue to emphasize the deep cultural and diaspora ties as a foundation of trust. Singapore\u2019s model of multicultural harmony (with a strong Chinese cultural component balanced by Malay, Indian and Western influences) is often admired quietly in China. By sharing experiences on governance, multiculturalism, and development with Chinese counterparts, Singapore positions itself as a *friendly teacher* or *guide* rather than a competitor. This soft power\u2014honed through decades of close people-to-people exchange\u2014means Singapore can sometimes convey difficult feedback or suggestions to China in ways that are more acceptable than if coming from Western nations. In Chinese eyes, Singapore can thus occupy a special category of partner: ethnically familiar, economically advanced, politically non-aligned, and sincerely interested in China\u2019s peaceful rise. This is a priceless niche that Singapore should continue to occupy and leverage.\n\nBy cementing this image of indispensability, Singapore makes itself an **irreplaceable stakeholder** in China\u2019s relations with the region. This not only encourages Beijing to engage Singapore more deeply on economic, technological, and cultural fronts, but also gives Singapore tacit influence to nudge China towards constructive policies (since advice from a valued partner carries weight). The key is that China should continue to see a **growing, prosperous Singapore as aligned with China\u2019s own interests**\u30104\u2020L72-L76\u3011 \u2013 a narrative Singapore can reinforce at every turn.\n\n## Serving as a Bridge and Mediator between the U.S. and China  \nOne of Singapore\u2019s boldest strategic goals is to play the role of mediator and bridge-builder in the U.S.-China rivalry. As a small state with close ties to both great powers, Singapore has **\u201cextensive contacts with Washington and Beijing and understands both sides\u201d**\u301030\u2020L15-L18\u3011. It has a track record of providing neutral ground for historic dialogues \u2013 from hosting the 1993 Wang-Koo talks (cross-strait dialogue) and the 2015 Xi-Ma meeting between Chinese and Taiwanese leaders\u301032\u2020L1005-L1013\u3011, to facilitating the 2018 Trump-Kim U.S.-North Korea summit. Encouragingly, there are calls within Singapore to take on a **more active mediator role between China and the U.S.**, leveraging the city-state\u2019s reputation as an honest broker\u301032\u2020L1001-L1009\u3011. This must be executed carefully to avoid overstepping, but several pragmatic steps can be pursued:  \n\n- **Host High-Level Dialogues:** Singapore can regularly offer itself as a neutral venue for U.S.-China dialogues \u2013 whether official summits or informal Track 1.5/2 meetings. An example could be reviving a Singapore-hosted *\u201cG2\u201d* dialogue where influential former officials and experts from the U.S. and China meet quietly to discuss flashpoints (trade, cyber, Taiwan, etc.) and propose solutions. Such meetings, under Singapore\u2019s hospitality, provide a relaxed atmosphere away from the pressures of Washington or Beijing. Singapore\u2019s credibility in ensuring security and discretion for such talks is well-established. Over time, this could institutionalize Singapore as the **\u201cgo-to\u201d location for East-West strategic dialogue**, much like Geneva was during the Cold War.  \n- **Champion Multilateral Engagement:** Through its role in ASEAN and other forums, Singapore should consistently invite and encourage both powers to participate in cooperative initiatives. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has noted that **ASEAN\u2019s approach is \u201cactive multi-engagement\u201d \u2013 engaging all major powers and avoiding exclusive blocs\u301014\u2020L159-L167\u3011**. For instance, Singapore can strengthen the ASEAN Regional Forum and East Asia Summit as platforms where U.S. and Chinese leaders engage annually under neutral regional agendas. In the defense realm, Singapore\u2019s hosting of the Shangri-La Dialogue each year already brings U.S. and Chinese defense officials into the same room; Singapore can use its convening power there to facilitate sideline bilateral meetings and confidence-building announcements (even something as simple as re-establishing military communication hotlines can be brokered). By ensuring these forums remain inclusive and not tilted toward one side, Singapore helps prevent the region from splitting into rival camps.  \n- **\u201cInterpreter\u201d of Intentions:** Singapore\u2019s leaders, who have personal rapport with both American and Chinese leadership, can act as unofficial messengers to clarify intentions and dispel misconceptions between the two powers. For example, Singaporean officials could relay concerns or proposals from one side to the other in private \u2013 a role Singapore has played at times in the past. As an outside party that is **\u201cneither pro-US nor pro-China, but pro-Singapore\u201d**, Singapore has the standing to speak frankly to both\u301011\u2020L53-L60\u3011. When Singapore urges the U.S. to, say, **\u201cstabilise your relations with China, because for the rest of Asia, we depend on it\u201d** (as PM Lee advised the Atlantic Council) or tells China that Southeast Asia doesn\u2019t want to choose sides, it does so with the region\u2019s credibility behind it\u30108\u2020L33-L37\u3011\u301014\u2020L129-L137\u3011. These messages can subtly influence U.S. and Chinese policymakers to moderate their approaches.  \n- **Facilitate Practical Cooperation:** Propose and lead trilateral or cross-cutting initiatives where both U.S. and China can participate without direct confrontation. Singapore might, for example, initiate a **U.S.-China-ASEAN Digital Cooperation initiative** on setting common data standards, or a climate change working group based in Singapore where American and Chinese experts jointly pilot green projects in Southeast Asia. By focusing on shared global challenges (pandemic preparedness, climate, anti-terrorism financing, etc.), Singapore creates opportunities for U.S. and Chinese officials to work side by side on neutral ground. Success in these small cooperative projects can build trust that spills over to the larger relationship. Singapore\u2019s role is to identify win-win domains and convince both that collaboration in these areas does not compromise their rivalry but benefits all.  \n- **Publicly Advocate Stability and Balance:** Continue to use Singapore\u2019s voice on the international stage to urge moderation. Singapore\u2019s consistent refrain is that **no country in Asia wants a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d or to be forced into rival blocs\u301014\u2020L129-L137\u3011**. By vocally promoting principles of coexistence and mutual respect \u2013 for instance, at the UN or global forums \u2013 Singapore keeps international pressure on Washington and Beijing to manage their competition responsibly. The city-state can share its perspective that the **\u201cinterests of Washington and Beijing are not entirely incompatible\u201d**, and encourage them to **\u201cfocus on common ground and gradually rebuild trust\u201d**\u301014\u2020L122-L130\u3011. In doing so, Singapore positions itself as a rational mediator urging peace, which both great powers may heed to some degree, if only out of respect for Singapore\u2019s earnest neutrality.\n\nWhile Singapore alone cannot resolve U.S.-China strategic tensions, these efforts enhance its **\u201cself-perception as a regional power and global city\u201d** that punches above its weight in diplomacy\u301032\u2020L1001-L1009\u3011. The very act of trying to mediate elevates Singapore\u2019s international standing. More tangibly, if Singapore can help avert miscalculations \u2013 even in small ways \u2013 it safeguards its own security and the broader region\u2019s stability. Both Washington and Beijing are likely to appreciate a partner who, without favor or prejudice, tirelessly advocates for dialogue and the upholding of a rules-based order that benefits all\u30104\u2020L113-L121\u3011. Singapore must, of course, be careful not to insert itself where it\u2019s unwelcome; its mediation should be discreet and always with the consent of both giants. Done prudently, Singapore can truly be an **\u201cindispensable mediator\u201d** that preserves its friendship with both powers.\n\n## Balancing Geopolitical Sensitivities and Security Interests  \nIn executing the above strategies, a central thread is **geopolitical balance**. Singapore\u2019s ability to deepen ties with China will mean little if it comes at the cost of antagonizing the United States or destabilizing the region. Thus, each initiative must be calibrated against Singapore\u2019s overall foreign policy principle: *engage all, but align with none*. Singapore\u2019s leaders have explicitly rejected a zero-sum mentality, insisting that Singapore will *\u201cnot take sides, but uphold principles\u201d*\u301025\u2020L19-L27\u3011. To maintain this delicate equilibrium, the action plan incorporates safeguards and parallel efforts:  \n\n- **Reassure the United States and Other Partners:** Singapore should be transparent with the U.S. about its dealings with China, emphasizing that greater economic or cultural cooperation with Beijing is not a shift in strategic alignment. For example, when inking new deals with China, Singapore can concurrently highlight ongoing U.S.-Singapore collaboration \u2013 such as the renewal of the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding that grants U.S. forces access to Singapore\u2019s bases (extended for another 15 years in 2019), or major new investments by American firms in Singapore. By **\u201cactively engaging partners outside Asia, including the US, EU, UK\u201d** even as it engages China\u301014\u2020L201-L210\u3011, Singapore signals it seeks **\u201coverlapping circles of friends\u201d** rather than exclusive alliances\u301021\u2020L33-L37\u3011. The U.S., for its part, has often stated it does not force countries to choose \u2013 Singapore can hold Washington to that assurance by demonstrating that its China ties ultimately contribute to regional stability from which the U.S. also benefits.  \n- **Maintain Strong Defense and Security Posture:** Singapore must continue investing in its own defense and retaining close security ties with countries like the U.S., Australia, and regional partners. The message to China is that these ties are non-negotiable aspects of Singapore\u2019s security. At the same time, Singapore can engage China on defense to build mutual trust in non-threatening ways. The 2019 Enhanced Defence Agreement between Singapore and China \u2013 which expanded bilateral exercises and dialogues \u2013 is a platform to **deepen defense cooperation without aligning militarily**\u30107\u2020L31-L39\u3011. Joint exercises (e.g. naval drills focused on search-and-rescue or humanitarian assistance) and high-level military exchanges can continue, but Singapore will avoid entering any mutual defense pact or intelligence alliance that targets a third party. By **welcoming both new U.S. security initiatives (like the Quad/AUKUS, so long as they\u2019re inclusive) and China\u2019s participation in ASEAN defense forums\u301014\u2020L145-L154\u3011\u301014\u2020L147-L155\u3011**, Singapore shows it supports a balanced security architecture. In practice, this means Singapore might host port calls by both U.S. and Chinese navy ships, invite both to multilateral exercises (like Singapore\u2019s annual ADMM-Plus maritime exercise), and share best practices on things like military medicine or disaster relief with both. Such even-handedness prevents misperceptions of favoritism.  \n- **Careful Navigation of Sensitive Issues:** On contentious matters \u2013 the South China Sea, Taiwan, human rights \u2013 Singapore should stick to principled positions and avoid loud partisanship. For instance, Singapore supports the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, but it voices this through ASEAN consensus and quiet diplomacy rather than joining any \u201canti-China\u201d coalition\u30109\u2020L679-L688\u3011\u30109\u2020L691-L699\u3011. Likewise on Taiwan, Singapore upholds the One-China policy (recognizing Beijing) even as it maintains unofficial ties with Taipei; it conducts military training in Taiwan discreetly and not as an affront to Beijing. By **\u201cmaintaining an objective and fair position\u201d** and urging peaceful dialogue\u30109\u2020L697-L704\u3011, Singapore minimizes the chance of fallout with China while not compromising its principles. Simultaneously, Singapore can encourage the U.S. to also exercise restraint on these flashpoints (e.g. cautioning against provocative freedom-of-navigation operations or unscripted remarks on Taiwan) \u2013 reinforcing its mediator role. The overarching approach is consistency: Singapore\u2019s friends know where it stands because it has *\u201ca track record of consistent, predictable actions\u201d* based on rule of law\u301016\u2020L384-L393\u3011. This consistency is the bedrock of trust that allows Singapore to say \u201cno\u201d when it must, without being seen as hostile.  \n- **Protecting Singapore\u2019s Own Autonomy:** Ultimately, Singapore\u2019s careful balancing acts serve one principal aim: ensuring Singapore\u2019s survival and autonomy in an era of giants. The government should diversify Singapore\u2019s dependencies so that no single external power (China, U.S., or others) can exert undue leverage. This means keeping a diverse economic portfolio (e.g. while growing China trade, also nurture trade with India, the EU, and regional partners), a diversified tech ecosystem (not relying solely on Chinese or Western tech for critical infrastructure), and a resilient defense (with arms procurement and training relationships spanning many partners). Internally, Singapore should guard against foreign interference by any party \u2013 for example, monitoring that increased cultural ties with China do not open the door to malign influence or propaganda that could stoke ethnic tensions. Singapore has strong laws and social norms to prevent this, and these should be vigilantly upheld. By strengthening its \u201csmall state resilience,\u201d Singapore can engage big powers on its own terms, from a position of confidence rather than vulnerability.\n\nIn essence, balance and pragmatism permeate every element of this action plan. As **ASEAN countries \u201cdo not want to be forced to choose sides\u201d and seek to be friends with both the U.S. and China\u301014\u2020L129-L137\u3011**, Singapore will exemplify this stance. The city-state will continue its **\u201cactive multi-engagement\u201d** \u2013 working with all major powers and **avoiding zero-sum choices**\u301014\u2020L159-L167\u3011 \u2013 thereby preserving regional stability. This careful choreography ensures Singapore deepens ties with China in a way that **enhances** its strategic security rather than undermining it. Singapore\u2019s leaders can confidently say, as Lawrence Wong did, that all these efforts are *\u201cpro-Singapore\u201d* \u2013 serving Singapore\u2019s national interests first\u301011\u2020L53-L60\u3011, which in turn lie in a stable, prosperous Asia where great powers cooperate more and conflict less.\n\n## Conclusion: A Bold and Forward-Looking Path  \nSingapore\u2019s future prosperity and security will be defined by how it navigates the China-U.S. dynamics while advancing its own interests. The strategies outlined above form a comprehensive and forward-looking action plan for Singapore to **deepen economic cooperation with China, become an invaluable cultural and tech partner to Beijing, and encourage China\u2019s deeper engagement** with Singapore \u2013 all without compromising its independence or its vital relationship with the U.S. This plan builds on a decade of growing trust between Singapore and China, but boldly pushes the envelope through new initiatives: from upgrading trade pacts and pioneering green digital projects, to launching visa-free exchanges and joint innovation hubs, to offering Singapore\u2019s good offices in service of great-power d\u00e9tente.\n\nCrucially, each initiative is paired with a nuanced understanding of geopolitical sensitivities. Singapore will continuously balance on the tightrope: expanding ties with China while reassuring the U.S. and other countries, standing firm on principles while avoiding provocation, and strengthening its own national resilience at every step. As one analysis noted, Singapore\u2019s very ability to balance and hedge between China and the U.S. relies on *\u201clinking Singapore to multiple powers\u201d* and not putting all eggs in one basket\u30106\u2020L219-L228\u3011\u30106\u2020L231-L236\u3011. This action plan embodies that wisdom \u2013 a diversified engagement strategy that maximizes opportunities and minimizes risks.\n\nIn implementing this plan, Singapore should remain **flexible and pragmatic**. The regional environment will evolve \u2013 U.S.-China relations may face new crises or breakthroughs, domestic changes will occur in each country \u2013 so Singapore must adjust tactics as needed, guided by the core principle of serving Singapore\u2019s long-term interests. Boldness must be tempered with foresight: for example, if U.S.-China competition in technology intensifies, Singapore might need to recalibrate certain tech collaborations, or if China-ASEAN relations enter a new phase, Singapore might leverage that to further its mediator role. Policymakers should regularly consult diverse stakeholders (businesses, academia, citizen groups) to ensure the strategies carry broad support and truly benefit Singaporeans.\n\nIn summary, a Singapore that successfully deepens ties with China while **maintaining balance** will enhance its standing as a sovereign, thriving \u201csmall heavyweight\u201d nation. It will be a key economic gateway for China, a cultural and innovative partner that China values, and a respected voice that can bridge East and West. This is a bold vision, but one grounded in the realistic assessment of Singapore\u2019s strengths \u2013 strategic location, trusted reputation, and agile diplomacy. By executing this action plan, Singapore can look to the future with confidence: it need not choose sides in the new Cold War, but instead can choose to be **on the side of principles, peace, and prosperity**\u301025\u2020L19-L27\u3011 for itself and the region. Such a role is difficult, but as history shows, Singapore is most secure when it is relevant to all and beholden to none.
