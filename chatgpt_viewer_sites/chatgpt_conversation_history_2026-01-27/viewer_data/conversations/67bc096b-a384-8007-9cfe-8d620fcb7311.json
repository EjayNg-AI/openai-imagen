Unlabelled Simple Graphs Up to Isomorphism\n\n### Counting unlabelled graphs\nAn *unlabelled* simple graph on \\(n\\) vertices is counted *up to isomorphism*, meaning that two labeled graphs that differ only by a relabelling of vertices are identified as the *same* unlabelled graph. So the total number of unlabelled simple graphs on \\(n\\) vertices is strictly smaller than \\(2^{\\binom{n}{2}}\\), but still grows extremely quickly with \\(n\\).\n\n### Connectivity still dominates\n- From well-known results in graph enumeration, we know that **most** unlabelled graphs on \\(n\\) vertices are still *asymmetric* (i.e., they have no nontrivial automorphisms) and also *connected*.\n- More precisely, if you pick a graph *at random from all unlabelled graphs* on \\(n\\) vertices (with uniform probability over isomorphism classes), then the probability that it is connected goes to 1 as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).  \n\nHence, **the proportion of unlabelled simple graphs on \\(n\\) vertices that are connected also approaches 1.** Consequently, the *number* of connected unlabelled simple graphs exceeds the number of disconnected unlabelled simple graphs, and the disparity grows with \\(n\\).\n\n### Why the ratio still goes to 1\nIntuitively, you can think of the labeled case and note that \u201calmost all\u201d labeled graphs are:\n\n1. Asymmetric, so each isomorphism class has size \\(\\approx n!\\).  \n2. Connected.\n\nBecause each large isomorphism class in the labeled setting collapses to exactly one unlabelled graph, and *most* labeled graphs belong to these \u201cgeneric\u201d (asymmetric, connected) classes, you get that almost all unlabelled graphs are also connected. The formal arguments use exponential generating functions or Polya\u2013Redfield counting methods, but the bottom line is that the *connectivity phenomenon* for large \\(n\\) does not disappear under the passage from labeled to unlabelled.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Undirected, Unlabelled Multigraphs Up to Isomorphism\n\nFor *multigraphs*, we have to specify exactly how we allow multiple edges (and possibly loops). The typical definitions vary, but two common scenarios are:\n\n1. **Multiedges allowed, no loops**: Each pair of vertices can carry an unbounded (or bounded) number of edges, but no loop-edges on a single vertex.  \n2. **Multiedges and loops allowed**: Each vertex can also have loops, possibly multiple loops, etc.\n\n### Infinite or finite counting?\n- Strictly speaking, if each pair of vertices can have arbitrarily many edges (with no upper bound) or each vertex can have arbitrarily many loops, the set of all such multigraphs (even on a fixed \\(n\\)) is *infinite*. One typically has to restrict the maximum number of edges between any two vertices or the number of loops to keep the family finite.  \n- Another approach is to consider something like: \u201cPick each potential edge multiplicity (for each pair of vertices) according to some distribution,\u201d or place an upper bound on the multiplicity so that we still have a finite set to count.\n\n### Connectivity vs. disconnectedness in multigraphs\nRegardless of how the details are set up, the essence of the \u201cmost graphs are connected\u201d phenomenon *still applies*. The reasoning (in a high-level sense) is that adding the possibility of multiple edges between vertices *increases* the ways a graph can become connected (for instance, having multiple parallel edges between components certainly doesn\u2019t hurt connectivity).\n\n- **If there\u2019s a maximum edge multiplicity** \\(M\\), the total number of such (simple or multiedge) graphs on \\(n\\) vertices is \\((M+1)^{\\binom{n}{2}}\\) (if loops are not allowed) or \\((M+1)^{\\binom{n}{2} + n}\\) (if loops are allowed).  \n- By analogy with the Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi argument, for large \\(n\\), the fraction of multigraphs (labeled) that are connected can still be shown to go to 1 (the typical graph is highly connected). Thus, the fraction that is disconnected goes to 0, whether or not we allow multiple edges or loops.\n\nOnce we pass to **unlabelled** multigraphs (up to isomorphism), the argument that \u201calmost all are connected\u201d still carries over in the same way as for simple graphs. The typical labeled multigraph has no nontrivial automorphisms and is highly connected, so almost all unlabelled isomorphism classes end up being connected as \\(n\\to \\infty\\).\n\nHence, in broad terms:\n\n> **The connectivity dominance does not go away** just because we move to (i) unlabelled simple graphs or (ii) unlabelled multigraphs (with finite constraints). In each large-\\(n\\) setting, the number of connected objects vastly outnumbers the disconnected ones once \\(n\\) is large.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n1. **Unlabelled Simple Graphs**:  \n   - Even though we are quotienting out by all relabelings (isomorphisms), the fraction of connected unlabelled graphs still approaches 1.  \n   - So for large \\(n\\), there are *more* connected unlabelled simple graphs than disconnected ones.\n\n2. **Unlabelled Multigraphs**:  \n   - If we impose a finite upper bound on edge multiplicities to keep the set finite, then as \\(n\\to\\infty\\), a random (labeled) multigraph is almost surely connected.  \n   - Translating to the unlabelled setting again yields that the proportion of connected classes goes to 1.  \n   - Therefore, connected unlabelled multigraphs also outnumber the disconnected ones for large \\(n\\).\n\nThe key takeaway is that **the \u201cconnectedness overwhelmingly dominates\u201d** principle holds across all these variations once \\(n\\) is large, whether labeled or unlabelled, simple or multigraph (with finite constraints)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"06195b92-1953-4dcc-843e-f416518805c7","request_id":"916d3945f802fdea-IAD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"06195b92-1953-4dcc-843e-f416518805c7","children":[]}}}
