Contrary to widespread fears about AI, Altman noted that he worries more about how older generations will adapt to AI than how children will. He believes younger people will naturally become fluent with new technologies, as history has shown. However, he also commented on the growing concern of youths over-relying on AI tools like ChatGPT for decision-making, suggesting this trend could be harmful if people begin to outsource life choices to AI. This aligns with similar views expressed by NYU professor Jonathan Haidt, who has highlighted serious dangers social media poses to children's mental health and attention spans. Haidt has warned that the widespread decline in attention could be an even greater challenge than the mental health crises linked to technology use.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753339384.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-privacy-therapy-sam-altman-openai-lawsuit-2025-7","title":"Sam Altman says your ChatGPT therapy session might not stay private in a lawsuit","snippet":"Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, cautioned users that ChatGPT therapy-style conversations do not carry the same legal confidentiality protections as discussions with licensed professionals such as therapists or doctors. In a podcast with Theo Von, Altman noted that conversations with ChatGPT could be subject to disclosure in lawsuits, as AI chats don't benefit from legal privileges like doctor-patient or attorney-client confidentiality. He emphasized the growing use of ChatGPT for personal and emotional support, especially among young people, and highlighted the urgent need to address privacy laws surrounding AI interactions.\n\nAltman also pointed out that OpenAI staff can access chat logs to improve the model and monitor misuse, unlike encrypted apps where messages are not visible to third parties. Although OpenAI deletes ChatGPT chats within 30 days, they may be retained longer for legal or security reasons. Furthermore, OpenAI is currently appealing a court order from The New York Times and others in a copyright lawsuit demanding indefinite retention of user logs, including deleted ones. Altman also expressed concerns about the psychological impact of addictive social media on children.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753444424.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.windowscentral.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-chatgpt/sam-altman-openai-fundamentally-new-computer","title":"Sam Altman admits current computers were designed for an AI-free world - but OpenAI's new type of computer will make the AI revolution \"transcendentally good\"","snippet":"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged that existing computers were designed without AI in mind and are increasingly inadequate for supporting the next generation of AI capabilities. In a recent interview, Altman and OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap discussed their plans to develop innovative AI hardware that surpasses current digital assistants, aiming for devices that offer comprehensive situational awareness and contextual understanding. This move aligns with similar sentiments expressed by Google's CEO Sundar Pichai, who noted the limitations of current systems in achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAI\u2019s push into AI hardware follows its $6.5 billion acquisition of design legend Jony Ive\u2019s startup, io, signaling ambitions to produce revolutionary devices that could rival tech giants like Apple and Google. Although specifics remain under wraps, Altman hinted at a desire to surprise the public with a transformative new kind of computer, capable of seamlessly integrating AI into daily life. Meanwhile, competitors like Amazon continue to struggle with their AI offerings, such as Alexa, due to financial constraints and uncertain consumer appeal.

Speaking at a Federal Reserve conference, Altman predicted entire job categories, such as customer support, could soon vanish due to the growing capabilities of AI, which he described as more efficient and mistake-proof than human workers. He also noted AI's superior diagnostic abilities compared to most doctors, though emphasized he still values human oversight in healthcare. Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, warned that AI advancements might eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years and increase U.S. unemployment to around 20% by 2030.

While Altman acknowledges the hidden complexities of this vision, the discussion underscores the need for careful evaluation of AI's social and ethical implications.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"**Education outlook**: Shared that his child will \u201cprobably not\u201d attend college, citing a rapidly evolving AI-driven educational landscape","start_idx":1549,"end_idx":1687,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"**Education outlook**: Shared that his child will \u201cprobably not\u201d attend college, citing a rapidly evolving AI-driven educational landscape","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"1545-0","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news16\ue201","start_idx":1688,"end_idx":1706,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fed-ad87262a4c1e71a0695ff6d06a2586f2?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fed-ad87262a4c1e71a0695ff6d06a2586f2?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI's Sam Altman warns of AI voice fraud crisis in banking","url":"https://apnews.com/article/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fed-ad87262a4c1e71a0695ff6d06a2586f2?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753198469.702335,"snippet":"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warns of a looming fraud crisis in the financial industry due to AI's ability to mimic voices.","attribution_segments":["1545-0"],"supporting_websites":[{"title":"'Kids will be fine; I'm worried about...': Sam Altman says his kid will probably not attend college","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/kids-will-be-fine-im-worried-about-sam-altman-says-his-kid-will-probably-not-attend-college/articleshow/122908740.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753456978.0,"snippet":"\u2018Kids will be fine; I\u2019m worried about\u2026\u2019: Sam Altman says his kid will probably not attend college Date: Fri Jul 25 20:52:58 2025 UTC+05:30  Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has offered his...","attribution":"The Times of India"},{"title":"Sam Altman on AGI, GPT-5, and what's next - r/accelerate - Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/accelerate/comments/1lejj5a/sam_altman_on_agi_gpt5_and_whats_next_the_openal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750204800.0,"snippet":"I find the shift in narrative from AGI being the goal to superintelligence being the goal to be a very interesting one.","attribution":"Reddit"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":16},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AP News"}],"fallback_items":[{"title":"'Kids will be fine; I'm worried about...': Sam Altman says his kid will probably not attend college","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/kids-will-be-fine-im-worried-about-sam-altman-says-his-kid-will-probably-not-attend-college/articleshow/122908740.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753456978.0,"snippet":"Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, shared his perspective on the evolving role of education in light of technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence.
