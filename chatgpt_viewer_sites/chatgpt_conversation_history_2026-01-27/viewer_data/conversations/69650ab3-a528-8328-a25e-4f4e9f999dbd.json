I\u2019ll suggest Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet as examples based on their strong business moats and solid financials, but I\u2019ll be careful not to imply future performance. I'll verify their business segments and financial metrics. A disclaimer on risk is important.\n\n**Choosing diversified tech firms for long-term potential**\n\nI\u2019m considering Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia, or maybe Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. I want to ensure these firms have diversified moats, strong balance sheets, and recurring revenue to weather future risks, including disruptions or regulatory challenges. To back up my choices, I\u2019ll look up the latest data on their revenue, market share, and potential risks.\n\n**Selecting and justifying tech companies for long-term ownership**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia. Apple is another solid choice, but I think Microsoft and Alphabet offer diversified strengths. Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI compute is huge, though there\u2019s some risk in GPU supply and competition. Broadcom is a possible candidate, but the three I\u2019ve chosen focus on AI.\n\n**Justifying long-term tech picks with considerations**\n\nWhen justifying my picks, I\u2019ll focus on each company\u2019s competitive advantages like durable moats, R&D, network effects, and management. I'll highlight certain risks too, including antitrust concerns and tech cycles. My picks\u2014Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia\u2014all trade on US equity markets, and I\u2019ll ensure the response emphasizes long-term resilience and innovation, with disclaimers.\n\n**Citing up-to-date company performance for justification**\n\nI\u2019ll use the most current data I can find to justify my picks. For Nvidia, I'll focus on their data center revenue from their Q3 FY2026 results. For Microsoft, I\u2019ll highlight Azure growth, citing their Q4 FY2025 press release. Alphabet\u2019s growth in cloud and AI integration will also be backed by their Q3 2025 results.\n\n**Using specific segments and growth data to justify picks**\n\nI\u2019ll reference key segments like Google Services, Cloud, and Other Bets from Alphabet\u2019s 10-Q, along with Cloud growth from the SEC exhibit. For Nvidia, I\u2019ll focus on Data Center revenue, GPUs, networking, software, and export controls. I\u2019ll aim to keep it crisp, with broad justification instead of precise valuations, since they change. Instead, I'll highlight that long-term growth compounds.\n\n**Justifying technology picks with long-term potential**\n\nFor the three picks, I\u2019d go with:\n\n- **Microsoft**: Strong in enterprise software, cloud, and productivity tools (Microsoft 365, Azure, LinkedIn). High switching costs, strong cash flows, and ongoing AI integration make it durable.\n\n- **Alphabet**: Leading in search, ads, YouTube, Android, and Cloud. Strong data and AI potential, though with regulatory risks.\n\n- **Nvidia**: AI compute backbone, but cyclical with export control risks and intense competition. Still critical in data center growth.\n\n**Selecting top tech firms for long-term ownership**\n\nThe user asked for three firms to own for 20 years. To stick with the brief, I'd go with:\n\n- **Microsoft**: Diversified across software, cloud, and AI.\n- **Alphabet**: Strong presence in ads, YouTube, AI, and cloud.\n- **Apple**: Strong ecosystem, though dependent on hardware, but still solid for long-term.\n\nConsidering ASML or TSM as alternatives is tempting but might complicate the response.\n\n**Confirming firm picks and citations**\n\nFor picking firms, I should ensure they\u2019re on a US exchange, with clear reasoning. ASML might be an honorable mention due to its EUV tech, but I need credible sources to back up claims. Also, I\u2019ll include disclaimers, noting that my picks aren\u2019t guaranteed to be profitable, and highlight risk.\n\n**Summarizing firm picks with concise table**\n\nI can consider adding a small table to summarize details like the moat, durability, risks, and what to watch for each firm, but I want to avoid a complex one. Citations can follow punctuation. The user didn\u2019t ask for news, but maybe a navlist of relevant articles could be useful to include.\n\n**Including relevant articles with navlist**\n\nTo help the user explore further, I think adding a navlist with 3-5 recent articles would be helpful. I\u2019ll include pieces about companies like Nvidia, Alphabet, and possibly Microsoft, as well as some industry insights such as TSMC. It\u2019ll include relevant news from sources like Reuters and MarketWatch.\n\n**Crafting a balanced 20-year portfolio response**\n\nI\u2019ll provide three companies with reasoning, along with risk considerations, valuation disclaimers, and how they fit into a 20-year portfolio. I\u2019ll define any technical terms like AI, R&D, EBITDA, and CAPEX. I\u2019ll be objective and critique reasonably, mentioning long-term holding complexities without sugarcoating.\n\n**Summarizing 20-year portfolio picks with risks**\n\nIf I had to choose three companies for a 20-year hold, I'd pick Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia due to their platform distribution, recurring cash flows, and AI potential. However, I need to mention risks: valuation, regulatory issues, and market volatility. I'll provide supporting citations from SEC filings and Reuters.\n\n**Maintaining accuracy and using relevant numbers for citations**\n\nFor Alphabet, I'll reference the SEC exhibit for its cloud revenue increase and for Nvidia, I'll highlight its Q3 2026 records and relevant acquisitions. I\u2019ll use some numbers, being careful to ensure accuracy. I'll verify details from SEC and Reuters sources to back these claims. Some figures will help illustrate scale, especially given the user\u2019s mathematical background.\n\n**Clarifying citations, segments, and risk disclaimers**\n\nFor Microsoft, I\u2019ll mention their segment breakdown: Productivity, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Alphabet has segments like Google Services, Cloud, and Other Bets. Nvidia's data center revenue and export controls from their 10-K and Q3 results will be included. I'll cite at least 5 sources, ensuring to mention exchanges and tickers, and add risks and disclaimers about long-term ownership. I\u2019ll emphasize durable economic moats, high switching costs, platform scale, and substantial R&D.\n\n**Outlining long-term risks and investments**\n\nWhen recommending a 20-year hold, factors include share dilution, capital allocation, the ability to grow earnings, a strong balance sheet, and a wide moat\u2014but also the risk of disruption and regulatory challenges. I\u2019ll provide forward-looking metrics to track. For each company (Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia), I\u2019ll summarize key points like segment growth, cloud earnings, and risks such as antitrust and competition. I\u2019ll also include key sources for each like press releases and SEC filings.\n\n**Clarifying detailed investment considerations for Alphabet and Nvidia**\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) stands out for its strong information distribution, integrated AI, and cloud growth, but risks include AI shifts and regulatory issues. Nvidia (NVDA) benefits from its AI compute platform but faces cyclical risks and competition. However, all three tech companies may be highly correlated, so consider diversifying with semiconductors or foundries. Some honorable mentions could be Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML.\n\n**Framing my response carefully and including disclaimers**\n\nThe user requested examples of technology firms on the US equity market. I'll focus on providing tickers and exchange information, ensuring they're from the technology sector. I'll avoid overusing \"I\" and treat pickings as \"if forced.\" I'll include reasoning for durable demand, pricing power, and risks. Disclaiming that it's not financial advice is crucial while offering insights into long-term durability from certain firms. To give a well-rounded answer, I\u2019ll reference reliable sources for citations. I'll ensure compliance with policies and avoid personalized recommendations.\n\n**Planning my citations and response draft**\n\nI\u2019ll gather sources to strengthen my response: \n\n- Microsoft 10-K for segments and M365 info. \n- Alphabet SEC exhibit for segments and Cloud growth. \n- Nvidia\u2019s revenue and data centers from official sources. \n\nI can also mention Azure's $75B in sales and growth stats from latest news or Microsoft press releases. For Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud, I\u2019ll reference their growth from SEC filings. This will all come together in a clear markdown response.\n\n**Drafting response structure**\n\nI\u2019ll structure the reply as follows:  \n- Start with a disclaimer, setting criteria for 20-year holdings.  \n- Then, list the three tech picks: Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia, explaining key reasons, risks, and monitoring factors.  \n- Add a note about diversification and valuation.  \n- Optional honorable mentions (ASML, Broadcom) with brief info.  \n- Finally, provide a navlist of relevant news sources with references like Reuters, Verge, MarketWatch if applicable.\n\n**Selecting long-term tech picks**\n\nIf I had to lock in three US-listed tech firms for 20 years with zero trades, I\u2019d choose Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia. These companies have enduring moats, solid R&D, and adaptability in the face of change. However, 20 years is long; performance could vary across cycles, so consistent monitoring is key. \n\nI\u2019d stick with *large-cap* firms like MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA. Each has unique strengths with AI, cloud, and data center dominance. Just remember: it's no guarantee they won\u2019t underperform at times!\n\n**Selecting tech giants for long-term investment**\n\nIf I were to choose three US-based tech firms for the next 20 years without selling, I'd pick Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA). These companies all have durable moats, strong AI capabilities, and significant addressable markets. They also benefit from large-scale, high-margin businesses in cloud, AI, and semiconductor sectors.\n\nWhile these are large-cap, established players, be aware that they face regulatory risks, competition, and volatility in the market. Nonetheless, their platform advantages\u2014distribution channels, computing power, and developer ecosystems\u2014position them well for long-term growth.\n\nRemember though: 20 years is a long time. Keep an eye on key developments from each firm."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 15m 16s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-westus3-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-505de50e-cadb-46b5-8ed0-574ec0c89bc6:US","parent_id":"3d0c69e2-a34a-41a3-a7f6-809589782407","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_69650ab47cec81919c8318be6e3d67a3","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"69650ab4-7d04-8332-9483-a94a60f92e1d","async_task_created_at":"2026-01-12T14:52:36.873208Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"3d0c69e2-a34a-41a3-a7f6-809589782407","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"505de50e-cadb-46b5-8ed0-574ec0c89bc6","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"e1916db1-df12-4923-b02b-6b0331d527df","finished_duration_sec":916,"pro_skipped":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3d0c69e2-a34a-41a3-a7f6-809589782407","children":["80985087-54c8-4e6e-a54d-4db5a4870486"]},"80985087-54c8-4e6e-a54d-4db5a4870486":{"id":"80985087-54c8-4e6e-a54d-4db5a4870486","message":{"id":"80985087-54c8-4e6e-a54d-4db5a4870486","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768230473.392812,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["A 20\u2011year, \u201cno\u2011selling, ever\u201d commitment is a harsh filter. Even exceptional companies can get disrupted, regulated, or simply become bad capital allocators.

(Also: this isn\u2019t personalized financial advice.)\n\nA few abbreviations I\u2019ll use: **AI = artificial intelligence**; **GPU = graphics processing unit**; **CPU = central processing unit**; **DPU = data processing unit**; **API = application programming interface**; **SDK = software development kit**.\n\n## 1) Microsoft (MSFT)\n\n**Why I\u2019d be comfortable holding it for 20 years**\n- **Enterprise switching costs are real and persistent.** Microsoft sells deeply embedded business \u201cplumbing\u201d (productivity, identity, security, developer tools, business applications). It reports across three large segments\u2014**Productivity and Business Processes**, **Intelligent Cloud**, and **More Personal Computing**\u2014which is a built-in resilience feature: if one area slows, the others can carry. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n- **Cloud compounding + distribution advantage for AI.** Microsoft can push AI into products customers already pay for (e.g., Microsoft 365 and enterprise workflows), rather than needing to \u201cre-invent\u201d demand from scratch. In its FY2025 Q4 release it highlighted **Microsoft Cloud revenue of $46.7B (up 27% YoY)** and stated **Azure surpassed $75B in revenue (up 34%)** for the fiscal year\u2014evidence that the cloud engine remains strong and that Microsoft has enormous distribution to monetize new compute-heavy workloads. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n- **Cash-generation supports reinvestment and staying power.** Microsoft\u2019s scale lets it fund massive datacenter build-outs, security investment, and acquisitions while still returning capital (and\u2014crucially\u2014surviving inevitable tech regime shifts).\n\n**What could break the thesis**\n- **Regulatory/antitrust pressure around AI partnerships and bundling.** There\u2019s already litigation risk around its OpenAI relationship (a proposed antitrust class action filed in Oct 2025 alleges the OpenAI deal restricted compute supply and inflated prices). Even if claims fail, oversight can still constrain strategy. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n- **Cloud competition + margin pressure.** Building AI infrastructure is capital intensive and can pressure margins (Microsoft\u2019s annual report discusses cloud gross margin impacts from scaling AI infrastructure). \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n\n## 2) Alphabet (GOOGL / GOOG)\n\n**Why I\u2019d be comfortable holding it for 20 years**\n- **A \u201cdefault\u201d ecosystem with multiple cash engines.** Alphabet\u2019s Google Services portfolio includes **Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome, Maps, Play**, etc.\u2014products with massive user adoption and distribution power. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n- **Advertising is the core, but revenue is broader than ads.** Google Services increasingly generates revenue from **consumer subscriptions** (e.g., YouTube services and Google One), **platforms** (Google Play), and **devices** (Pixel). That breadth matters over 20 years because it reduces single-format dependence. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n- **Cloud + AI is a genuine second pillar (not just a side project).** Alphabet\u2019s filings describe Google Cloud revenues as primarily **consumption-based fees and subscriptions**, and explicitly position offerings like **Vertex AI** and **Gemini** inside the Cloud story. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n- **The financial base is enormous.** In its 2024 10\u2011K, Alphabet reports segment revenues of about **$304.9B (Google Services)** and **$43.2B (Google Cloud)** in 2024, with Google Cloud showing meaningful scale relative to almost any enterprise software company. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n**What could break the thesis**\n- **Antitrust remedies and ongoing regulatory constraints.** The U.S. Department of Justice announced in Sept 2025 that the court\u2019s remedies in the search case include prohibiting certain exclusive contracts (around distribution of Search/Chrome/Assistant/Gemini), requiring certain search data to be made available to rivals, and requiring syndication services to enable competitors. That is exactly the kind of long-horizon risk you have to underwrite for Alphabet. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- **AI changes the \u201csearch\u201d interface.** Even if Google remains central, the way users find information and the economics of ads could shift. Alphabet\u2019s own risk disclosure acknowledges competitive risks as technologies evolve and as AI offerings proliferate. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n## 3) NVIDIA (NVDA)\n\n**Why I\u2019d be comfortable holding it for 20 years**\n- **It\u2019s not \u201cjust chips\u201d; it\u2019s a full-stack platform.** NVIDIA\u2019s 10\u2011K describes its Data Center platform as compute + networking offerings delivered with software/services, including a \u201cgrowing body\u201d of acceleration libraries, APIs, SDKs, and domain-specific frameworks\u2014and highlights the **CUDA** parallel programming model and CUDA\u2011X libraries as part of what makes it a \u201cfull-stack computing platform.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n- **Networking + systems matter as AI scales.** NVIDIA emphasizes that as AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads scale across thousands of nodes, the **data center becomes the unit of computing** and networking becomes integral\u2014this is important because it expands the moat beyond a single chip SKU (stock keeping unit). \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n- **The economics show real platform power.** NVIDIA reports that in fiscal year 2025, **gross margin increased** driven by a **higher mix of Data Center revenue**, and provides the FY2025 margin figures (75.0% vs 72.7% prior year) with mix as a key driver. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n- **Demand is currently enormous (and that matters for reinvestment capacity).** NVIDIA\u2019s Q3 FY2026 release reported **$57.0B revenue** with **$51.2B Data Center revenue** in the quarter\u2014numbers that (whether they persist or normalize) imply tremendous resources to fund R&D and maintain a fast product cadence. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n\n**What could break the thesis**\n- **Geopolitics/export controls and China uncertainty.** Reuters reported in early Jan 2026 on China-related uncertainty around NVIDIA\u2019s H200 shipments, including requirements like full upfront payment and references to prior inventory impacts from export restrictions. That\u2019s a reminder that part of NVIDIA\u2019s risk is political, not purely technological. \ue200cite\ue202turn7news34\ue202turn7news35\ue201  \n- **Customer concentration + vertical integration risk.** Hyperscalers (very large cloud providers) designing custom silicon could compress long-run margins; NVIDIA must keep its platform advantage (software + networking + systems) strong enough that \u201cbuild\u201d remains less attractive than \u201cbuy.\u201d\n\n## Why these three together\nIf you force concentration into *only* three US\u2011listed tech names for 20 years, I\u2019d want exposure to:\n- **Enterprise software + cloud distribution** (Microsoft),\n- **Consumer + business attention + data + a scaled cloud** (Alphabet),\n- **The computational substrate of modern AI and accelerated computing** (NVIDIA).\n\nThat gives you coverage across the stack: applications/workflows \u2192 platforms/distribution \u2192 compute/networking.\n\n## A blunt note on the premise\nOwning only three single stocks for 20 years **without ever selling** is closer to a philosophy bet than an investing process. The most common failure mode isn\u2019t \u201cthese companies go to zero,\u201d it\u2019s: *the world changes, regulators intervene, capital allocation degrades, and you miss opportunities to rebalance risk.*\n\nIf you *do* want to behave like a long-horizon owner, the disciplined version is: hold great businesses, but keep a written \u201csell discipline\u201d for thesis breaks (moat erosion, bad capital allocation, structural regulatory impairment), even if you rarely use

requiring full upfront payments from Chinese buyers for its H200 AI chips amid regulatory uncertainty in China. Unlike previous arrangements, the company now mandates no cancellations, refunds, or configuration changes after orders are placed. In rare cases, asset collateral or commercial insurance may be accepted instead of cash. This move reflects Nvidia's cautious response to uncertainty about Chinese regulatory approval of the high-performance chips.\n\nChinese firms, having ordered over 1.2 million H200 chips (priced around $27,000 each), face competition for Nvidia's limited inventory of 700,000 units. Despite the development of domestic alternatives like Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910C, Nvidia's chips remain superior for large-scale AI model training.\n\nThe Chinese government is reportedly set to approve some imports for commercial use, excluding sensitive sectors. Meanwhile, authorities are directing local companies to temporarily pause orders while deciding on the required ratio of domestic to imported chips per purchase.\n\nThe payment demand is also a risk-mitigation strategy, especially after Nvidia previously wrote down $5.5 billion in lost inventory from a sudden U.S. export ban. Nvidia is boosting production of the H200 through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., with shipments expected to begin before the Lunar New Year in mid-February 2026.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Nvidia CEO says purchase orders, not formal declaration, will signal Chinese approval of H200","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-government-is-working-feverishly-nvidia-licenses-china-ship-date-still-2026-01-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"At the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that Chinese government approval for importing H200 chips from the U.S. will likely not come via a formal announcement but be evident through incoming purchase orders. Despite no official green light, Huang noted strong demand for the chips in China and said Nvidia has already activated its supply chain to meet this demand. Earlier, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress mentioned that the U.S. government is actively processing license applications for Nvidia to ship H200 chips to China, but no timeline has been provided for approvals. The U.S. reauthorized these exports after reversing a previous ban in 2025. Separately, Nvidia introduced a new \"Vera Rubin\" chip line and is optimistic about its production capacity and supply chain stability. Nvidia has projected $500 billion in sales from its current \"Blackwell\" chips and upcoming Vera Rubin generation by the end of the year, with ongoing discussions about future data center projects extending into 2027.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":7768,"end_idx":7768,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Microsoft 2025 Annual Report","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html","attribution":"microsoft.com"},{"title":"AI users sue Microsoft in antitrust class action over OpenAI deal | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ai-users-sue-microsoft-antitrust-class-action-over-openai-deal-2025-10-13/","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"goog-20241231","url":"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm","attribution":"SEC"},{"title":" Office of Public Affairs |  Department of Justice Wins Significant Remedies Against Google | United States Department of Justice","url":"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-wins-significant-remedies-against-google","attribution":"Department of Justice"},{"title":"NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for Third Quarter ...","url":"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2026?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"NVIDIA Newsroom"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2026","https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2026?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-wins-significant-remedies-against-google","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q4/press-release-webcast","https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html","https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ai-users-sue-microsoft-antitrust-class-action-over-openai-deal-2025-10-13/","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-government-is-working-feverishly-nvidia-licenses-china-ship-date-still-2026-01-06/","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-government-is-working-feverishly-nvidia-licenses-china-ship-date-still-2026-01-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-requires-full-upfront-payment-h200-chips-china-sources-say-2026-01-08/","https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-requires-full-upfront-payment-h200-chips-china-sources-say-2026-01-08/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"aboutamazon.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Amazon.com Announces Third Quarter Results","snippet":"AWS segment sales increased 20% year-over-year to $33.0 billion.

I'll suggest companies that could be viable 20-year holds, explaining why they may not be the top 3. Since this is investing-related, I might still check recent financial positions to make sure the picks are reliable.\n\n**Explaining honorable mentions for long-term tech investment**\n\nI need to suggest tech firms for long-term holding, carefully considering honorable mentions like Apple, Amazon, and Broadcom. These firms, along with others, could be viable 20-year investments. I should clarify that ADRs like ASML are acceptable, but I should provide general info, not personalized investment advice.\n\n**Selecting and justifying honorable mentions for tech investment**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on selecting 5-7 honorable mentions from various sectors like hardware, cloud, and semiconductors. While companies like Visa and Mastercard are important, they\u2019re more financial services than classic tech. I'll include firms like Apple, Amazon, Meta, TSMC (as an ADR), and ASML. I\u2019ll verify key details through recent data to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Balancing general and specific data for tech suggestions**\n\nI want to focus on key factors like ecosystem, services, and brand for companies like Amazon and Meta, without getting too deep into financials. However, since citations were used earlier, I should keep that consistent. I\u2019ll aim for general reasoning but use data-backed facts when necessary, especially for key statements.\n\n**Selecting and justifying honorable tech mentions**\n\nThe user requested honorable mentions without needing recent data, so I can use general reasoning, but I\u2019ll be cautious about data being outdated. I\u2019ll provide 6-7 firms like Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Broadcom, offering justification for why they\u2019re worth considering long-term. I\u2019ll keep risks in mind, like geopolitical concerns or regulatory pressures.\n\n**Selecting honorable mentions and sourcing citations**\n\nI\u2019m thinking of adding a couple more companies like Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys. These fit into tech but may not be as widely known as others. I\u2019ll aim for 8 honorable mentions, ensuring they\u2019re US-listed and provide necessary citations like SEC filings (10-K or 20-F) for each firm.\n\n**Considering UI elements for stock tickers**\n\nUser didn't ask for stock prices, but could benefit from one chart. There are guidelines about using a finance widget for stock price charts, but limiting to one chart per response. I\u2019m leaning towards skipping the chart to avoid overwhelming the user, but might consider one for clarity on AAPL.\n\n**Deciding on presentation format and sources**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to present the info. A table could work for summarizing why these companies are durable and their risks, but since the user asked for honorable mentions, bullet points feel right. I\u2019ll gather sources from SEC filings, aiming for credibility, while keeping things manageable. I\u2019ll define technical terms like EDA when necessary.\n\n**Planning citation collection from filings**\n\nI plan to craft my answer with separate paragraphs for each company, citing relevant SEC filings. Since I can only make up to 4 search queries per call, I'll organize queries in two to three calls. I'll make sure citations refer to search snippets or the filings themselves for clarity and accuracy.\n\n**Gathering sources for latest filings**\n\nI\u2019m considering using the most recent filings, like Apple\u2019s 2025 10-K, as they might have updated segment information. While the user didn\u2019t specifically ask for the latest filings, it's useful for a current view. I\u2019ll ensure citations don\u2019t overwhelm the answer and focus on key segments and moats from each company.\n\n**Crafting the response with disclaimers and criteria**\n\nOkay, I have sources for the companies mentioned. Now I need to list a few honorable mentions with brief justifications, and explain why they don't make the top 3. I'll emphasize the 20-year sustainability criteria and define abbreviations like EDA, EUV, and SoC. I'll keep the citations manageable but ensure they support key points.\n\n**Citing factual claims and business details**\n\nWhen providing details, I\u2019ll cite factual claims backed by filings or reliable sources. I'll focus on their business segments, models, and moats and ensure to reference filings directly. For reasoning like \"ecosystem creates switching costs,\" I'll avoid citations unless referencing risk factors or business descriptions.\n\n**Citing the 2024 Apple 10-K**\n\nSince the 2025 10-K is the most recent, I\u2019ll use it for citing Apple\u2019s business description, but I'll opt for the 2024 10-K HTML version as it\u2019s more comprehensive. I\u2019ll focus on the business segments breakdown, ensuring I check beyond the snippets for this critical information.\n\n**Summarizing Segment Info for Apple, Amazon, Meta, Broadcom**\n\nFor Apple, I'll mention product and services categories, with services as a significant revenue driver, citing specific lines from the 10-K. We have Amazon\u2019s, Meta\u2019s, and Broadcom\u2019s segment info too. Next, I'll open and cite ASML\u2019s annual report, TSMC's 20-F, TI's, and Cadence's filings to support key statements.\n\n**Handling Errors with ASML and Texas Instruments Reports**\n\nI encountered an internal error trying to open the ASML report PDF\u2014perhaps it's too large. I\u2019ll try again, or check the SEC 20-F for ASML. For Texas Instruments, the 10-K PDF also failed, so I\u2019ll look for an SEC 10-Q for segment descriptions. That should work.\n\n**Clarifying SEC Filings for ASML and TSMC**\n\nI\u2019m looking for the 10-K filings for Texas Instruments (2024) on SEC EDGAR, as the investor.ti.com PDF didn\u2019t work. For ASML, I might use the SEC 20-F for their 2024 filing. There\u2019s some confusion around the CIK numbers\u20141046179 points to TSMC, not ASML. I\u2019ll double check.\n\n**Finding Relevant Details in TSMC and ASML Reports**\n\nI think the version from the website is TSMC\u2019s 20-F HTML, which\n\n**Resolving ASML Report Issues**\n\nThe ASML annual report page seems dynamic, and it might not display key content due to JS requirements. There's a PDF link to the 2024 report that might be accessible. The initial attempt to open the report resulted in an error. I\u2019ll try using the full URL instead of the reference ID.\n\n**Troubleshooting ASML Report Source**\n\nI got a strange error, it says \"failed to fetch with (400) OK,\" which might be due to PDF retrieval issues. I\u2019ll shift focus to a different source: searching for ASML's SEC 20-F form for 2024. I\u2019ll try searching for \"ASML Form 20-F 2024 SEC 2025\" instead.\n\n**Opening ASML SEC 20-F and Reuters for sources**\n\nI\u2019ve found the SEC 20-F for ASML, and it mentions how AS\n\n**Investigating SEC Access Issue**\n\nThere's an odd error \u2014 \"400 OK\" \u2014 which could be due to a header issue or user-agent restrictions, though I've had success with SEC sources before. It might be a bad request or blocked access. I'll try opening the index page on SEC as an alternative to get the info.\n\n**Exploring alternative ways to access ASML data**\n\nThe index page opened, but the ASML document failed to load, possibly due to size or special characters. Instead of opening large files, I can try the referenced .txt file, though it might be too big. Alternatively, I can cite the key information directly from the search snippet.\n\n**Citing snippets for accuracy**\n\nWe need to be cautious about using snippets for ASML's EUV manufacturing claim, as it's from an SEC page, but the full context isn't obvious. However, the snippet can be cited directly. For Texas Instruments, the snippet from an SEC page works too, even if it's not the 10-K.\n\n**Opening the TXN 10-K**\n\nI found what looks like Texas Instruments' 10-K from their SEC filing (txn-20241231). This should be\n\n**Preparing to analyze TSMC 20-F details**\n\nOkay, we've got solid information on TI's segments and strategy, citing the website. Now, for TSMC\u2019s 20-F PDF, we need to focus on key areas like the foundry and process technologies. I'll search through the document using \"foundry\" to find relevant details.\n\n**Summarizing TSMC insights and citations**\n\nThe search for \"foundry\" didn\u2019t return any results, possibly due to word limits, but \"process technologies\" gave us relevant content, focusing on TSMC\u2019s dedication to being a foundry, developing advanced nodes, and driving HPC growth. We\u2019ll cite the relevant statements, touch on geopolitical risk using trusted news sources, and consider a press release citation if needed.\n\n**Gathering sources for ASML, Cadence, and risks**\n\nFor ASML, I\u2019ll cite their claim as the \u201cworld\u2019s only manufacturer of EUV,\u201d using Reuters for export restrictions and China risks. For Cadence, I\u2019ll reference their 10-K and mention tools in EDA, but also bring in export control risk via Tom's Hardware. I\u2019ll prioritize government sources, like DOJ, for legal matters.\n\n**Finalizing Citations for Amazon, Meta, Apple, Broadcom**\n\nI\u2019ll cite official DOJ and BIS press releases about Cadence\u2019s settlement instead of Tom's Hardware. For Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, and Apple, I have specified sources for segments and services. For Broadcom, I\u2019ll mention its acquisition of VMware and infrastructure software, citing relevant sources for those details.\n\n**Deciding on Citations for Additional Companies**\n\nI\u2019ll cite Amazon, Meta, Apple, TSMC, ASML, Texas Instruments, and Cadence based on the sources I have. I\u2019m considering mentioning \u201cAdobe\u201d and \u201cServiceNow\u201d as honorable mentions or including Synopsys, but they would require further research and citations. For now, I\u2019ll stick with the companies I\u2019ve already sourced.\n\n**Selecting Honorable Mentions and Providing Context**\n\nSynopsys is in, and we have sources. The user asked for 5-8 honorable mentions, including names like Apple, Amazon, Meta, etc. I\u2019ll list the top 7 with short explanations and key risks, making sure to note that these aren't necessarily long-term holds. We\u2019ll offer some disclaimers for context.\n\n**Organizing Honorable Mentions with Key Risks and Selection Criteria**\n\nFor each honorable mention, I'll highlight 2 reasons why they\u2019re good picks and 1 key risk for each. I'll give a brief preface explaining that this list is for tech firms that are suitable for long-term holds, with a focus on U.S.-listed companies. I'll also add selection criteria and necessary disclaimers to the response.\n\n**Organizing by Category with Key Risks**\n\nI'll have 7-9 companies sorted into categories. I'll specify why they didn't make the top 3 due to risks like Apple's iPhone reliance, Amazon's margin volatility, Meta's regulatory issues, and others. For each, I'll include citations, like Apple\u2019s 10-K to show product and services sales. I'll also define key terms like EUV, DUV, and EDA.\n\n**Citing Key Financials and Segments**\n\nFor Apple, I\u2019ll refer to their net sales split into Products ($294.866B) and Services ($96.169B) without quoting every number, just noting that Services is significant. Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, and ASML will each be cited for their relevant financials and market segments, including export restrictions for ASML.\n\n**Providing Final Thought and Citations**\n\nI\u2019ll mention export controls affecting customer spending and market share, especially with China and geopolitical tensions (referencing TSMC and Cadence). For Texas Instruments, their focus on long-term cash flow is key. Citations from various sources like their 10-K reports, Reuters, and DOJ should be included. I\u2019ll avoid using specific URLs."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 12m 29s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-westus3-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-405679dd-b528-4ed7-8d9b-4f04ed531bbe:US","parent_id":"cf8c6228-4b71-495e-b150-4cba3f19e5ff","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_696513880084819197c0b3337f2d5c32","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"69651388-00ac-832b-9735-75c25d510a85","async_task_created_at":"2026-01-12T15:30:16.168023Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"cf8c6228-4b71-495e-b150-4cba3f19e5ff","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"405679dd-b528-4ed7-8d9b-4f04ed531bbe","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"fe39f2bf-aab7-48eb-aac4-a517e097f5d3","finished_duration_sec":749,"pro_skipped":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cf8c6228-4b71-495e-b150-4cba3f19e5ff","children":["bf0d5efb-95c4-4d89-b98a-b395702ce3c7"]},"bf0d5efb-95c4-4d89-b98a-b395702ce3c7":{"id":"bf0d5efb-95c4-4d89-b98a-b395702ce3c7","message":{"id":"bf0d5efb-95c4-4d89-b98a-b395702ce3c7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768232566.177548,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here are the **US\u2011listed tech \u201chonorable mentions\u201d** I\u2019d seriously consider for a *20\u2011year hold*\u2014but that I didn\u2019t put in the top 3 because the \u201cnever sell\u201d constraint makes certain risks (regulation, cyclicality, geopolitics, capital intensity) loom larger.\n\nI\u2019ll define a few terms upfront: **ADR = American Depositary Receipt** (a way for a non\u2011US company\u2019s shares to trade on a US exchange). **R&D = research and development**. **EUV = extreme ultraviolet** (lithography). **DUV = deep ultraviolet** (lithography). **High\u2011NA = high numerical aperture** (optical design that enables tighter patterning). **GenAI = generative artificial intelligence**.\n\n## Apple (AAPL)\n**Why it\u2019s a long-horizon compounder candidate**\n- Apple\u2019s differentiation is *integration*: it \u201cdesigns and develops nearly the entire solution,\u201d spanning hardware, operating system, applications, and related services\u2014an approach that tends to create sticky ecosystems. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n- Services is a meaningful, high\u2011margin engine inside Apple\u2019s model: in FY2024, Apple reports **Services net sales increased**, driven by **advertising, the App Store, and cloud services**, and it discloses **Services gross margin** far above Products. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view4\ue201  \n\n**Why I didn\u2019t put it in the top 3**\n- You\u2019re underwriting a lot of **consumer hardware concentration + platform regulation risk** (especially around the App Store). That\u2019s survivable, but \u201cnever sell\u201d makes it harder to ignore.\n\n## Amazon (AMZN)\n**Why it\u2019s compelling**\n- Amazon is structurally diversified. In its 10\u2011K it reports three segments: **North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view1\ue201  \n- Even within \u201csales,\u201d the mix is broad: Amazon states that **service sales** include **third\u2011party seller fees, AWS sales, advertising services, and Amazon Prime membership fees** (among other items). \ue200cite\ue202turn5view2\ue201  \n\n**Why I didn\u2019t put it in the top 3**\n- It\u2019s a *wonderful business*, but it\u2019s also a **high\u2011complexity, high\u2011capex** machine with multi-front regulatory exposure. If you truly can\u2019t sell, you\u2019re forced to live through those cycles no matter what.\n\n## Broadcom (AVGO)\n**Why it\u2019s compelling**\n- Broadcom has become a hybrid: it reports two segments\u2014**semiconductor solutions** and **infrastructure software**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view3\ue201  \n- It has direct leverage to AI infrastructure beyond GPUs: its 10\u2011K describes networking products addressing bottlenecks in **AI data centers** (e.g., Ethernet network interface cards and switching). \ue200cite\ue202turn4view3\ue201  \n- The **VMware acquisition** is explicitly positioned as strengthening its infrastructure software offering. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue201  \n\n**Why I didn\u2019t put it in the top 3**\n- Higher **customer concentration** and more **acquisition/integration** dependency than I\u2019d want under a \u201cnever sell\u201d rule (even if the strategy works well).\n\n## Meta Platforms (META)\n**Why it\u2019s compelling**\n- Meta is still a cash engine: its 10\u2011K states it generates **substantially all revenue** from selling **advertising placements** across its family of apps (Family of Apps segment). \ue200cite\ue202turn12view3\ue201  \n- It\u2019s also explicitly investing in AI and next\u2011platform bets (Reality Labs), which is a form of long\u2011dated optionality. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view3\ue201  \n\n**Why I didn\u2019t put it in the top 3**\n- The business is still **very ad\u2011dependent**, and it acknowledges Reality Labs is expected to **operate at a loss for the foreseeable future**\u2014fine if ads stay strong, painful if the ad engine gets impaired by regulation or platform shifts. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view3\ue201  \n\n## ASML (ASML) \u2014 ADR\n**Why it\u2019s compelling**\n- ASML is close to the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d end of the semiconductor stack. In its Annual Report extract, it discusses EUV system dynamics and notes delivery of the **first High\u2011NA EUV lithography system** and ongoing EUV/DUV demand considerations. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201  \n- It frames AI as a key driver of semiconductor growth and discusses scaling EUV technology well into the next decade. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201  \n\n**Why I didn\u2019t put it in the top 3**\n- **Export controls/geopolitics** are not a side risk\u2014they\u2019re central. Reuters reports ASML cited export-control uncertainty weakening demand, and discusses China sales exposure and expectations for decline. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view2\ue201  \n\n## Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) \u2014 ADR\n**Why it\u2019s compelling**\n- TSMC\u2019s moat is *scale + leading-edge execution*. In its 2024 Form 20\u2011F, it reports advanced nodes\u2019 importance, including that **advanced technologies (7\u2011nanometer and below)** were **69% of total wafer revenue in 2024** (and provides node breakdowns including 3nm and 5nm). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- It also explicitly frames advanced-capacity scale as a competitive advantage and discusses expansion of advanced nodes. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view4\ue201  \n\n**Why I didn\u2019t put it in the top 3**\n- The \u201cnever sell\u201d constraint collides with **Taiwan geopolitical tail risk**. Even if you think the probability of a severe event is low, the impact is so large that it deserves top billing.\n\n## ServiceNow (NOW)\n**Why it\u2019s compelling**\n- ServiceNow\u2019s 10\u2011K positions the Now Platform as a cross\u2011enterprise workflow platform and ties its value proposition to digitizing workflows across departments. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view1\ue201  \n- It also claims very deep enterprise penetration (over **85% of the Fortune 500**, nearly **60% of the Global 2000**) and is explicitly pushing AI features (Now Assist, agentic AI, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn12view4\ue202turn7view1\ue201  \n\n**Why I didn\u2019t put it in the top 3**\n- Great business, but more **valuation sensitivity** and more \u201ccategory competition\u201d risk (large platform vendors can crowd the workflow layer over time).\n\n## Texas Instruments (TXN)\n**Why it\u2019s compelling**\n- TXN is a steadier \u201cindustrial tech\u201d compounder: filings describe its **Analog** segment (Power, Signal Chain) and **Embedded Processing** products, which it calls the \u201cdigital \u2018brains\u2019\u201d in many electronic systems. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search9\ue201  \n\n**Why I didn\u2019t put it in the top 3**\n- It\u2019s more exposed to **industrial cyclicality** and tends to be a slower grower; it can be a phenomenal hold, but it\u2019s not as \u201cobviously winner\u2011take\u2011most\u201d as the top 3 picks.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also do this more \u201cquant style\u201d: pick **5\u20137 criteria** (pricing power, switching costs, reinvestment runway, regulatory fragility, capital intensity, platform risk, geopolitics) and score the top 3 + these honorable mentions so you can see *why* the ordering
