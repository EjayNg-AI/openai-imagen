Here are the most common and effective methods:\n\n### 1. **Using FTP/SFTP**\n\n1. **Connect to Your Server**: Use an FTP client (like FileZilla, Cyberduck, or WinSCP) to connect to your server.\n2. **Navigate to the Theme Directory**: Go to `wp-content/themes/your-theme-name`.\n3. **Upload Changes**: Drag and drop the updated files from your local machine to the corresponding folder on your server. You can also overwrite existing files directly.\n\n### 2. **Using a Version Control System (e.g., Git)**\n\n1. **Set Up Git**: If your WordPress theme is tracked in a Git repository, commit your changes locally.\n2. **Push to Remote**: Push your changes to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket).\n3. **Pull Changes on Server**: SSH into your server and navigate to your theme directory. Run `git pull` to update the theme with the latest changes.\n\n### 3. **Using a WordPress Management Tool**\n\n- **Local Development Tools**: If you are using tools like Local by Flywheel, MAMP, or WAMP, they often provide features to synchronize changes with your live site.\n- **ManageWP or WP Engine**: These services allow you to manage updates, backups, and deployments across multiple WordPress sites easily.\n\n### 4. **Manual Upload via cPanel**\n\n1. **Log in to cPanel**: Access your hosting account's cPanel.\n2. **File Manager**: Go to the File Manager and navigate to `public_html/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name`.\n3. **Upload Files**: Use the upload feature to upload your updated files, overwriting the existing ones.\n\n### 5. **Using a Deployment Plugin**\n\n- **WP Pusher or DeployHQ**: These plugins can help automate the deployment process from your Git repository to your live WordPress site.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Backup Your Site**: Before making any updates, ensure you have a backup of your site and database.\n- **Test Locally**: Ensure your changes work as intended on your local setup before uploading them.\n- **Use Child Themes**: If you are customizing an existing theme, consider using a child theme to avoid losing changes during theme updates.\n- **Minimize Downtime**: If you expect significant changes that could disrupt user experience, consider scheduling updates during off-peak hours.\n\nChoose the method that best suits your workflow and the tools you are comfortable with."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o-mini","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o-mini","parent_id":"dec8b687-95bb-478a-832d-8e59510b92ed","request_id":"8d2d5e13de0dce26-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"dec8b687-95bb-478a-832d-8e59510b92ed","children":["aaa2fce4-eb42-4fa7-9ffa-ea1e34f98a5e"]},"aaa2fce4-eb42-4fa7-9ffa-ea1e34f98a5e":{"id":"aaa2fce4-eb42-4fa7-9ffa-ea1e34f98a5e","message":{"id":"aaa2fce4-eb42-4fa7-9ffa-ea1e34f98a5e","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1728969925.047172,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I have local by flywheel iinstalled and running.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n### 1. **Get Your FTP Credentials**\n\nBefore you start, make sure you have the following information from your hosting provider:\n\n- **FTP Hostname**: Usually something like `ftp.yourdomain.com` or your server's IP address.\n- **Username**: Your FTP username.\n- **Password**: Your FTP password.\n- **Port**: Typically port 21 for FTP or port 22 for SFTP (Secure FTP).\n\n### 2. **Choose an FTP Client**\n\nYou'll need an FTP client to connect to your server. Some popular FTP clients include:\n\n- **FileZilla** (free and widely used)\n- **Cyberduck** (free for macOS)\n- **WinSCP** (free for Windows)\n\n### 3. **Connect to Your Remote Server**\n\n1. **Open your FTP Client**: Launch the FTP client you chose.\n2. **Create a New Connection**:\n   - Enter the FTP hostname, username, password, and port.\n   - Click **Connect**.\n\n### 4. **Navigate to Your WordPress Theme Directory**\n\n1. **Locate Your WordPress Installation**: Once connected, navigate to your site's root directory, usually named `public_html` or `www`.\n2. **Go to Your Theme Folder**: Navigate to `wp-content/themes/your-theme-name`.\n\n### 5. **Upload Your Updated Files**\n\n1. **Local Changes**: On your local machine, locate the updated theme files.\n2. **Drag and Drop**: Select the files you want to upload and drag them to the remote theme directory in your FTP client. This will overwrite the existing files.\n3. **Confirm Overwrite**: If prompted, confirm that you want to overwrite the existing files.\n\n### 6. **Check Your Site**\n\n1. **Visit Your Website**: Open your web browser and navigate to your website to check if the updates are reflected.\n2. **Clear Cache**: If you use caching plugins, clear the cache to see the changes.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Backup Your Site**: Always make a backup of your theme or entire site before uploading new files, in case you need to revert changes.\n- **Use SFTP**: If your hosting provider supports it, prefer using SFTP over FTP for a secure connection.\n- **Limit File Changes**: Only upload files you\u2019ve changed to reduce the risk of issues.\n\nUsing FTP is a straightforward method to update your remote WordPress site efficiently!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o-mini","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o-mini","parent_id":"de8fd870-42f1-43ba-8ff0-9951ad2b1b6c","request_id":"8d2d74bbea6f81ad-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"de8fd870-42f1-43ba-8ff0-9951ad2b1b6c","children":[]}}}
