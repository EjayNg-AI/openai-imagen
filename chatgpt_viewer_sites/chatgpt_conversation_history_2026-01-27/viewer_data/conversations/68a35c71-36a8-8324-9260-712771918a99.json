In an $\\infty$-category, composition and identities exist only *up to coherent homotopy*, rather than strictly. Intuitively, this means that typical algebraic or topological objects (like spaces or chain complexes) can be organized into a category where not only objects and morphisms are present, but also homotopies between morphisms, homotopies between homotopies, etc., are part of the structure\u301033\u2020L83-L89\u3011\u301024\u2020L186-L194\u3011. Every ordinary category can be viewed as a degenerate $\\infty$-category (with no nontrivial higher morphisms), but $\\infty$-categories vastly enrich the picture by encoding *homotopical* information that ordinary categories forget\u301033\u2020L83-L89\u3011. This framework emerged from a pressing need in fields like algebraic topology and derived algebraic geometry to handle situations where compositions are associative or commutative only up to higher homotopies, and where one must keep track of these higher-order coherences.\n\nIn modern terms, an $(\\infty,1)$-category (the most common case) is an $\\infty$-category whose $k$-morphisms for $k>1$ are all invertible. There are many equivalent models (simplicial categories, Segal spaces, etc.), but a convenient definition (due to Joyal) is that an $\\infty$-category can be defined as a simplicial set satisfying the *inner Kan* condition (a *quasi-category*)\u30106\u2020L87-L95\u3011. This definition rigorously encodes a system of objects, morphisms, homotopies between morphisms, and so on, such that all familiar categorical laws hold *up to coherent homotopy*. A basic example is the *$\\infty$-category of spaces*: objects are (say) CW complexes or simplicial sets, 1-morphisms are continuous maps, 2-morphisms are homotopies of maps, 3-morphisms are homotopies between homotopies, etc. \u2013 essentially the *fundamental $\\infty$-groupoid* of a space, which captures its full homotopy type. In fact, **homotopy theory** itself can be identified with the study of $\\infty$-categories: a motto is that *\u201ca homotopy theory is an $\\infty$-category\u201d*\u301024\u2020L186-L194\u3011. Every Quillen model category or similar presentation of homotopy theory gives rise to an underlying $\\infty$-category (by formally inverting the \u201cweak equivalences\u201d) that retains all the homotopical information but discards the arbitrary choices of fibrations and cofibrations\u301024\u2020L186-L194\u3011. This shift to $\\infty$-categorical language allows us to work intrinsically with the *homotopy-coherent* structures that were only implicit or external in classical category theory.\n\nIn what follows, we delve into the motivations behind introducing $\\infty$-categories and *stable* $\\infty$-categories, and how they were developed to address shortcomings of earlier frameworks. We then discuss how stable $\\infty$-categories refine the notion of triangulated categories, providing better handling of exact sequences and homotopy-coherent diagrams. Finally, we examine how these concepts form a unifying framework in modern homotopy theory \u2013 generalizing classical algebraic and topological $K$-theory and powering new developments in spectral algebra and derived algebraic geometry. Throughout, we highlight insights from Lurie\u2019s *Higher Topos Theory* (HTT) and *Higher Algebra* (HA), which collectively laid much of the groundwork for $\\infty$-categories in today\u2019s mathematics.\n\n## Emergence of $\\infty$-Categories for Higher Homotopical Structures\n\nThe impetus for $\\infty$-categories arose from the realization that many *natural phenomena in homotopy theory cannot be adequately described by ordinary categories alone*. In homotopy theory, one often works with objects (like topological spaces or complexes) and morphisms defined *up to homotopy*. However, the **homotopy category** \u2013 obtained by identifying morphisms that are homotopic \u2013 loses crucial higher-order data. For example, given two homotopic maps $f,g: X\\to Y$, an ordinary homotopy category would consider $f$ and $g$ identical, whereas in an $\\infty$-category of spaces one retains a *2-morphism* (a homotopy) connecting $f$ to $g$. Moreover, homotopies themselves can be compared via higher homotopies (3-morphisms), and so on. *Homotopy theory naturally produces \u201chigher maps\u201d and thus calls for a notion of higher category*\u301023\u2020L626-L634\u3011. In short, *\u201chomotopy theory provides us with natural phenomena whose description requires higher maps, that is some notion of higher category.\u201d*\u301023\u2020L626-L634\u3011 This understanding crystallized towards the end of the 20th century, as mathematicians encountered situations (for instance, in loop space theory or deformation theory) where classical algebraic structures were \u201ctoo strict\u201d and had to be replaced by *homotopy-coherent* analogues (like $A_\\infty$-algebras, $E_\\infty$-operads, etc.)\u301023\u2020L518-L527\u3011. Higher categories (and related notions like $\\infty$-operads) were the eventual remedy, providing a rigorous yet flexible language to encode these hierarchies of coherences\u301023\u2020L522-L528\u3011.\n\nA pivotal insight was that any *model category* (Quillen\u2019s axiomatization of homotopy theory) actually presents an underlying $(\\infty,1)$-category. In other words, the complicated apparatus of model categories \u2013 with its cofibrations, fibrations, and weak equivalences \u2013 serves to give a 1-category presentation of a genuine $\\infty$-category that is the \u201ctrue\u201d homotopy theory\u301031\u2020L155-L163\u3011\u301024\u2020L186-L194\u3011. For example, the homotopy theory of topological spaces can be encoded by the model category $\\mathbf{sSet}$ (simplicial sets with the Kan\u2013Quillen model structure), but what it really *encodes* is an $\\infty$-category of spaces (equivalently, the $\\infty$-groupoid of spaces). By passing to $\\infty$-categories, one can work directly with these objects and their higher morphisms without the detour of model-categorical machinery. *Every model category $\\mathcal{M}$ yields an $\\infty$-category $\\mathcal{M}_\\infty$ that retains only the homotopy-essential information (weak equivalences become actual equivalences in $\\mathcal{M}_\\infty$)*\u301024\u2020L186-L194\u3011. This paradigm shift, championed by Joyal, Lurie, and others in the early 2000s, vastly simplified many homotopy-theoretic constructions by making *homotopy-coherent relationships explicit and functorial* rather than implicit.\n\nParallel needs arose in **derived algebraic geometry (DAG)**, where one studies \u201cderived\u201d or \u201chomotopy\u201d enhancements of schemes, stacks, and other algebraic structures. Classical algebraic geometry often uses **triangulated categories** (e.g. the derived category $D^b(X)$ of coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$) to organize complexes of sheaves up to quasi-isomorphism. But triangulated categories, being ordinary categories, suppress all higher Ext-group data beyond exact triangles. As To\u00ebn\u2013Vezzosi, Lurie, and others realized, a fully satisfactory theory of derived (or homotopical) geometry requires keeping track of those higher extensions and compatibilities \u2014 in essence, using *$\\infty$-categorical* tools rather than just triangulated categories. **Higher topos theory** (developed in Lurie\u2019s HTT) introduced *$\\infty$-topoi* and *$\\infty$-stacks*, which generalize Grothendieck topoi and stacks by allowing sheaves of *spaces* (or complexes) instead of just sets. In these contexts, $\\infty$-categories are ubiquitous. For instance, to a derived scheme one associates an **$\\infty$-category of quasicoherent sheaves** (really, complexes of modules) rather than just an ordinary derived category; this $\\infty$-category carries information about all higher Tor and Ext relations. *Stable* $\\infty$-categories (discussed below) become the natural home for derived categories in DAG, resolving limitations of triangulated categories. Indeed, Lurie notes that *\u201ctriangulated categories which appear naturally in mathematics are usually equivalent to the homotopy categories of suitable stable $\\infty$-categories.\u201d*\u301031\u2020L228-L236\u3011 In practice, whenever one has a triangulated category coming from geometry or topology (say a derived category of sheaves, or the stable homotopy category of spectra), one seeks an **enhancement** to an $\\infty$-category that contains the missing homotopy data. Derived algebraic geometry is largely built upon such enhancements: *stable $\\infty$-categories of complexes and spectra replace triangulated categories of complexes*, allowing for finer control and homotopy-coherent gluing of local data\u301019\u2020L2235-L2242\u3011. This shift has been crucial; for example, many delicate questions about duality, descent, and monoidal structures on derived categories become more tractable or even trivial in the $\\infty$-categorical setting.\n\nIn summary, $\\infty$-categories emerged from a broad recognition that **higher homotopies needed a home in category theory**. By extending categories to include morphisms of all orders, one can *encode precisely those higher structures appearing naturally in topology and algebra*\u301023\u2020L518-L527\u3011. Classical homotopy invariants and constructions (like homotopy limits/colimits, loop space machines, etc.) find a natural expression in $\\infty$-categories. This new language unified disparate approaches (simplicial categories, DG-categories, model categories) under a single conceptual roof. As one practitioner put it, *$\\infty$-categories are the \u201ctrue\u201d categories to consider, since they don\u2019t lose information and (homotopy) limits and colimits have a well-defined meaning in them*\u301013\u2020L137-L143\u3011. \n\n## From Triangulated Categories to Stable $\\infty$-Categories\n\nOne of the early triumphs of $\\infty$-category theory was the clarification of the relationship between **triangulated categories** and **stable $\\infty$-categories**. Triangulated categories (introduced by Verdier in the 1960s) are 1-categories equipped with an *auto-equivalence* (usually denoted $[1]$ or $\\Sigma$) and a class of \u201cdistinguished triangles\u201d $X \\to Y \\to Z \\to \\Sigma X$ that abstract the behavior of exact sequences in homological algebra. Triangulated categories had long been used to organize derived functors and spectra in a single framework. However, they come with well-known drawbacks: the triangulated structure is **not fully functorial** (for example, given a map of triangles one cannot always complete it to a morphism of triangles in a canonical way), and some higher coherences (like the `octahedral axiom\u2019) are complicated to verify and use. In essence, a triangulated category is the shadow (homotopy category) of some underlying homotopy theory, and working only at the level of this shadow can obscure or even lose important data.\n\nA **stable $\\mathbf{\\infty}$-category** is an $(\\infty,1)$-category that captures the homotopy-coherent content underlying a triangulated category. By definition, a stable $\\infty$-category $\\mathcal{C}$ is an $\\infty$-category that is *pointed* (has a zero object) and in which every morphism has a *fiber* and *cofiber*, with the property that *fiber sequences coincide with cofiber sequences*\u30106\u2020L113-L121\u3011. Concretely, being *pointed* means there is an object $0$ that is both initial and terminal, analogously to a zero object in an abelian category\u30106\u2020L87-L95\u3011\u301015\u2020L2401-L2409\u3011. A **triangle** in a pointed $\\infty$-category is just a diagram $X \\xrightarrow{f} Y \\xrightarrow{g} Z$ equipped with a filler to $0$ (homotopically, a null-homotopy of $g\\circ f$)\u301015\u2020L2404-L2412\u3011. The maps $X \\to Y$ and $Y \\to Z$ form a *fiber sequence* if $X$ is (homotopy) the fiber of $g$ (so $X \\to Y$ is like a kernel up to homotopy), and dually they form a *cofiber sequence* if $Z$ is the homotopy cofiber of $f$ (like a cokernel)\u301015\u2020L2415-L2423\u3011. **Stability** demands that these two notions coincide: *in a stable $\\infty$-category, every commutative triangle that is a homotopy pushout (cocartesian) square is automatically also a homotopy pullback (cartesian) square, and vice versa*\u301015\u2020L2421-L2427\u3011. Equivalently, the suspension functor $\\Sigma: \\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{C}$ (sending $X$ to the cofiber of $X\\to 0$) is an equivalence and provides a functorial loop-suspension symmetry. This axiomatically encodes a key property of stable homotopy theory: in the category of spectra (the prototypical stable category), fibers and cofibers agree and suspension is invertible\u30106\u2020L89-L97\u3011. Lurie succinctly describes triangulated categories as *\u201can attempt to capture those features of stable $\\infty$-categories visible at the level of homotopy categories\u201d*\u301031\u2020L230-L236\u3011. Indeed, *the homotopy category $\\mathrm{h}\\mathcal{C}$ of any stable $\\infty$-category $\\mathcal{C}$ is canonically a triangulated category* (with shift functor given by $\\Sigma$, and distinguished triangles given by fiber/cofiber sequences)\u30106\u2020L119-L127\u3011. This fundamental result required considerable work in Lurie\u2019s HTT/HA, but it formalizes the idea that *every naturally occurring triangulated category comes from a stable $\\infty$-category*\u301031\u2020L228-L236\u3011. In particular, one can *construct classical derived categories as homotopy categories of stable $\\infty$-categories*, resolving questions about the existence of \u201cenhancements\u201d\u30104\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u30104\u2020L51-L55\u3011.\n\n**Why is the $\\infty$-categorical enhancement worthwhile?** The answer lies in improved *functoriality, coherence,* and *clarity of universal properties*. Many of the ad hoc or opaque aspects of triangulated categories evaporate when one passes to stable $\\infty$-categories. For example, in a triangulated category, a mapping cone of a morphism $f: X\\to Y$ is only defined up to noncanonical isomorphism; in a stable $\\infty$-category, one can *choose* a specific cofiber of $f$ (essentially the homotopy pushout of $X \\leftarrow 0 \\to Y$) and it is defined *canonically up to contractible choices*, meaning any two choices are related by a *unique* higher homotopy\u301017\u2020L2460-L2468\u3011. This **contractibility of choices** in the $\\infty$-world is exactly the extra \u201chomotopy-coherent\u201d data that ensures functoriality. Thus, *cones (cofibers) in a stable $\\infty$-category are functorial* in a way that ordinary triangulated cones are not\u301017\u2020L2462-L2470\u3011. As a consequence, various triangle constructions become simpler: for instance, the notorious **octahedral axiom** of triangulated categories \u2013 a complicated diagrammatic condition \u2013 emerges automatically from iterated pushouts in a stable $\\infty$-category. In fact, verifying the octahedral axiom reduces to drawing a pasting of two pushout squares and observing it yields another fiber/cofiber sequence, with a suspension appearing naturally in one corner\u301017\u2020L2471-L2479\u3011. Intuitively, *the higher-dimensional homotopies in an $\\infty$-category supply all \u201ccoherence data\u201d that one must axiomatize by hand in a triangulated category*\u301017\u2020L2460-L2468\u3011\u301017\u2020L2471-L2479\u3011. Stable $\\infty$-categories thus **\u201cfix many of the problems\u201d** in triangulated category theory\u301015\u2020L2388-L2396\u3011. They are in some sense *simpler*: once one has the $\\infty$-categorical language at hand, the definition of a stable $\\infty$-category (zero object + finite limits/colimits + fiber=cofiber axiom) is much more natural and compact than the list of triangulated category axioms (which include octahedrality as a separate axiom)\u301015\u2020L2421-L2428\u3011. As one expository source puts it, *\u201cstable $(\\infty,1)$-categories are a wonderfully practical replacement for triangulated categories that fixes many of the problems in their theory\u201d*\u301015\u2020L2388-L2396\u3011.\n\nAnother major advantage is the handling of **exact sequences and homotopy-coherent diagrams**. In homological algebra, one juggles commutative diagrams that commute only up to specified isomorphisms; in an $\\infty$-category, one can instead work with *commutative diagrams up to homotopy*, where a \u201chomotopy\u201d is a 2-morphism filling the diagram. For example, a *commutative square up to homotopy* in an $\\infty$-category is a 2-simplex witnessing the homotopy-commutativity. Stable $\\infty$-categories make heavy use of this: a **distinguished triangle** $X \\to Y \\to Z \\to \\Sigma X$ can be seen as a homotopy-commutative square with $0$ in one corner\u301015\u2020L2406-L2415\u3011. The relationship \u201c$Z$ is a cofiber of $X\\to Y$\u201d is encoded by saying the square is a pushout (up to homotopy), and dually $X$ is a fiber of $Y\\to Z$ by saying the square is a pullback \u2013 in a stable $\\infty$-category these conditions coincide\u301015\u2020L2415-L2423\u3011. Because these diagrams live inside an $\\infty$-category, one can further talk about *morphisms of triangles* (3-morphisms connecting two homotopy-commutative squares) and so on, something impossible in an ordinary triangulated setting. All this added structure ensures that **exact sequences behave much better**: they satisfy universal properties rather than just existence and isomorphism classes. In essence, stable $\\infty$-categories provide an *enhancement* or *lift* of exact sequences to a homotopy-coherent context, where phenomena like mapping cones, shifts, and derived functors become functorial *and* compatible with higher homotopies.\n\nThe upshot is that whenever one has a triangulated category of interest \u2013 be it the derived category of an abelian category, the homotopy category of spectra, or the stable module category of a ring \u2013 upgrading it to a stable $\\infty$-category yields a more robust and powerful framework. For example, **derivators** were an attempt to regain some of this lost coherence above triangulated categories, but $\\infty$-categories achieve it more completely. Today it is common to say *\u201cuse a stable $\\infty$-category instead of a triangulated category whenever possible\u201d*, especially in research on homotopical and derived algebra. Indeed, many cutting-edge results (like in modular representation theory or in the theory of motives) assume the availability of an $\\infty$-categorical enhancement to apply tools like homotopy limits or adjoint functor theorems which are not available in the triangulated world\u301013\u2020L137-L143\u3011.\n\n## Unifying Framework: $K$-Theory, Spectral Categories, and Derived Geometry\n\nBeyond providing cleaner foundations, $\\infty$-categories \u2013 and stable $\\infty$-categories in particular \u2013 enable a **unified perspective on algebraic and topological $K$-theory** and other invariants, bridging classical subjects. *Algebraic $K$-theory*, as introduced by Quillen, assigns to a ring $R$ (or more generally an exact category or Waldhausen category) a sequence of groups $K_n(R)$ capturing profound arithmetic information. *Topological $K$-theory*, in the sense of Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch, assigns to a topological space $X$ the groups $K^0(X), K^1(X)$ (and periodic further groups) classifying vector bundles. At first glance, these two theories have different flavors; however, $\\infty$-category theory shows that **both are instances of the same construction applied to different stable $\\infty$-categories**. In modern language, one can define the *$K$-theory spectrum* $K(\\mathcal{C})$ of **any** small stable $\\infty$-category $\\mathcal{C}$, generalizing all earlier notions. This construction extends the classical $K$-theory of rings (via the stable $\\infty$-category of perfect complexes over the ring) and also encompasses topological $K$-theory (via the stable $\\infty$-category of vector bundles or perfect complexes on a space, suitably interpreted). The power of this approach is that it provides a *universal characterization*: roughly, *$K$-theory is the universal homology theory on stable $\\infty$-categories that is additive on exact sequences*\u301017\u2020L2507-L2515\u3011. In fact, the use of $(\\infty,1)$-categories has allowed mathematicians to formulate and prove a precise **universal property of higher $K$-theory**, analogous to how $K_0$ is the universal additive invariant of exact categories\u301017\u2020L2507-L2515\u3011. All the higher $K$-groups (and the entire nonnegatively graded $K$-theory spectrum) can be characterized by such a universal property\u301017\u2020L2507-L2515\u3011. This insight was elusive with earlier technology; it required the full higher-categorical framework (notably, Barwick\u2019s and others\u2019 work leveraging $\\infty$-categories). Consequently, many difficult aspects of $K$-theory can be streamlined by working $\\infty$-categorically: for instance, Waldhausen\u2019s additivity and d\u00e9vissage theorems, localization sequences, and multi-functoriality are naturally built into the $\\infty$-categorical formulation. \n\nConcretely, if $R$ is a ring (or ring spectrum), one considers $\\mathrm{Perf}(R)$, the stable $\\infty$-category of perfect complexes of $R$-modules (finite complexes of finitely generated projectives, in the discrete case). Then $K_n(R)$ is defined as $\\pi_{n}$ of the $K$-theory spectrum $K(\\mathrm{Perf}(R))$. When $R$ is a discrete ring, this recovers Quillen\u2019s definition; when $R$ is an $E_\\infty$-ring spectrum (such as $KU$, the complex periodic $K$-theory spectrum, or the sphere spectrum $\\mathbb{S}$), this gives the $K$-theory of that object. In particular, *topological $K$-theory fits into the pattern:* one can show (by deep results in index theory and Bott periodicity) that for a reasonable topological space $X$, the **complex topological $K$-theory** $K^*(X)$ is isomorphic to the *algebraic $K$-theory of the category of vector bundles on $X$*. In higher-categorical terms, $K^0(X)$ is the Grothendieck group of the symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category of vector bundles on $X$, and $K^{-n}(X)$ (which equals $K^0(X)$ for $n$ even, $K^1(X)$ for $n$ odd) can be obtained as well from that $\\infty$-category (essentially because Bott periodicity implies a suitable stability). Thus, both algebraic and topological K-theory become instances of *\u201c$K$-theory of a stable $\\infty$-category\u201d*. This unification is not just philosophical \u2013 it allows techniques to pass between algebra and topology. For example, some calculations of $K$-groups of ring spectra or schemes use topological methods (via the $\\infty$-categorical description and tools like trace invariants), and conversely, topological $K$-theory gains perspective as one example of a noncommutative (or derived) motive. The language of **spectral categories** is often invoked here: a **spectral category** means a category enriched in spectra (i.e. each hom is not just a set or space but a spectrum). Spectral categories can model stable $\\infty$-categories very well: in fact, *every (small) stable $\\infty$-category is equivalent (in the $\\infty$-categorical sense) to the derived ($\\infty$-)category of some small spectral category*\u301034\u2020L216-L224\u3011. For instance, one can take a small skeleton of the $\\infty$-category and endow it with a spectra-enriched Hom, yielding a spectral category whose homotopy category is triangulated. Many earlier \u201cenhancements\u201d of triangulated categories were given in terms of DG-categories or spectral categories; the $\\infty$-category viewpoint abstracts all those into one theory. Importantly, *$K$-theory can be applied to spectral categories as well*, and because spectral categories model stable $\\infty$-categories, this is no new information \u2013 just the familiar $K$-theory of the corresponding stable $\\infty$-category. This consistency is part of the appeal: invariants like $K$-theory, *topological cyclic homology* (TC), or *Hochschild/cyclic homology* all extend naturally from rings to differential graded categories to spectral categories, ultimately landing in the realm of $\\infty$-categories for their most general definitions. The modern theorem of Blumberg\u2013Gepner\u2013Tabuada, for example, constructs a symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category of small stable $\\infty$-categories and shows that its hom-object is related to $K$-theory\u301032\u2020L47-L51\u3011; informally, the space of maps between two stable categories $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ in this meta-category is $\\Omega^\\infty K(\\mathrm{Fun}^{\\mathrm{ex}}(\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{B}))$ (the infinite loop space of the $K$-theory of the category of exact functors between $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$)\u301032\u2020L47-L51\u3011. This kind of result underscores how **$\\infty$-categories provide a common ground where algebraic and homotopical constructions meet**.\n\nTurning back to **derived algebraic geometry (DAG)**: stable $\\infty$-categories are a cornerstone of that field. In DAG, one enriches classical schemes by allowing \u201cderived\u201d intersections (resolving singularities homotopically) and one replaces sheaves of rings by sheaves of *$E_\\infty$-ring spectra*. For a derived scheme or stack $\\mathfrak{X}$, one obtains a stable $\\infty$-category $\\mathrm{QCoh}(\\mathfrak{X})$ of (derived) quasi-coherent sheaves on $\\mathfrak{X}$, which is typically a symmetric monoidal presentable stable $\\infty$-category. These $\\infty$-categories *\u201creplace triangulated categories\u201d* in DAG, as noted in one survey\u301019\u2020L2235-L2242\u3011. By working with $\\mathrm{QCoh}(\\mathfrak{X})$ as an $\\infty$-category, one can perform *homotopy limits and colimits*, talk about *monoidal structures and duality* in a homotopy-coherent way, and glue local data along covers using $\\infty$-topos theory. None of this would be as straightforward with mere triangulated categories. Stable $\\infty$-categories thus allow DAG to rigorously treat phenomena like *derived pushforwards/pullbacks* of sheaves (which are adjoint functors between stable $\\infty$-categories, obeying exactness on homotopy limits), or to formulate **Tannakian duality** at the level of $\\infty$-categories (as in Lurie\u2019s DAG VIII). As a concrete example, Lurie\u2019s *DAG I* paper \u201cStable $\\infty$-Categories\u201d showed that if $\\mathcal{A}$ is an abelian category with enough projectives, then its classical derived category $D(\\mathcal{A})$ can be realized as the homotopy category of a certain stable $\\infty$-category $D_\\infty(\\mathcal{A})$ with a universal property\u30104\u2020L49-L57\u3011. This *derived $\\infty$-category* retains information like actual chain homotopies between quasi-isomorphic complexes, not just their existence classes, and it supports constructions like totalizations and filtrations leading to spectral sequences in a functorial manner\u30104\u2020L49-L57\u3011. More broadly, *any time we \u201cderive\u201d a functor or a construction, we are in effect passing to an $\\infty$-categorical setting*: one embeds objects into complexes or simplicial objects and then inverts quasi-isomorphisms (a homotopy theory), obtaining an $\\infty$-category in which the originally non-exact functor becomes homotopy-exact\u301031\u2020L262-L270\u3011\u301031\u2020L273-L282\u3011. Thus, $\\infty$-categories provide a universal language for *derived functor calculus*. \n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that **spectral algebraic geometry** \u2013 an even further extension where \u201crings\u201d are taken to be $E_\\infty$-ring spectra (such as Morava $E$-theories, etc.) \u2013 also relies on $\\infty$-categories. For instance, a *spectral scheme* is defined via a functor of points on the $\\infty$-category of $E_\\infty$-rings, and its category of modules is again a stable $\\infty$-category. In this way, $\\infty$-categories act as a *unifying framework* that connects classical algebraic geometry, homotopy theory, and new hybrid areas like DAG. They allow one to speak about objects like *perfect complexes on a scheme*, *compact objects in a derived category*, or *localization sequences of categories* in a common language, and thus classical results (like Nisnevich descent in $K$-theory, or the Bass\u2013Quillen conjectures) can be formulated and sometimes proven at this higher level with greater conceptual clarity.\n\n## Impact on Modern Homotopy Theory and Higher Category Theory\n\nThe development of $\\infty$-categories, especially through Lurie\u2019s foundational works, has profoundly influenced modern homotopy theory and higher category theory \u2013 to the point that these fields now largely *operate in $\\infty$-categorical terms by default*. **Higher Topos Theory (HTT)** provided the language of $(\\infty,1)$-categories and $\\infty$-topoi, enabling rigorous constructions of classifying spaces, homotopy sheaves, and derived stack quotients. For example, the notion of an **$\\infty$-topos** (Lurie\u2019s term) generalizes Grothendieck\u2019s topos (a category of sheaves of sets) to an $\\infty$-category of sheaves of spaces\u301019\u2020L2233-L2241\u3011. This was essential in defining objects like *Stacks* in a homotopical setting and proving descent statements needed in DAG. Concepts from classical category theory \u2013 limits, colimits, adjoint functors, monadicity, etc. \u2013 all have their counterparts (often more subtle) in $\\infty$-category theory, and HTT developed these systematically. **Higher Algebra (HA)** then built upon HTT by studying $\\infty$-operads and monoidal $\\infty$-categories, giving a framework for homotopy-coherent algebraic structures (like $E_n$-algebras) and for *stable* $\\infty$-categories in depth (HA begins with a thorough treatment of stability, exact functors, and spectra as the \u201cfree\u201d stable category on one generator\u30106\u2020L91-L99\u3011\u30106\u2020L95-L102\u3011). The result is that today\u2019s homotopy theorists freely talk about *presentable $\\infty$-categories*, *symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-categories*, or *colimits in an $\\infty$-category of spectra* as a routine matter \u2013 notions all defined in Lurie\u2019s work. The language is heavily used, for instance, in the solution of the **Cobordism Hypothesis** (which requires the theory of $(\\infty,n)$-categories to make sense of fully dualizable objects and $n$-fold adjoints), in the theory of factorization homology and $E_n$-algebras (higher monoidal categories), and in the study of **stable homotopy groups** of spheres (via the sophisticated manipulation of the $\\infty$-category of spectra and its subcategories of chromatic localizations).\n\nIn higher category theory itself, $\\infty$-categories serve as the basic building blocks for yet higher categorical structures. Many results about $(\\infty,n)$-categories for $n>1$ reduce to inductive or recursive structures built from $(\\infty,1)$-categories. For example, an $(\\infty,2)$-category can be modelled as an $\\infty$-category enriched in $\\infty$-categories, and so on. Thus the theory of $\\infty$-categories (with $n=1$) is the gateway to the entire tower of higher categories. This has conceptual payoffs: one can now seriously pursue the idea that *\u201c$\\infty$-groupoids are the same as homotopy types\u201d* (the Homotopy Hypothesis) as a theorem \u2013 indeed Kan complexes (\u221e-groupoids) model all spaces. Likewise, higher categorical generalizations of fundamental theorems (like Van Kampen, Giraud\u2019s axioms for topoi, etc.) are being proved in this language. The synergy with **type theory** (as in homotopy type theory and univalent foundations) is another modern development: $\\infty$-groupoids correspond to types, and $\\infty$-topoi to certain models of type theory, bridging logic and homotopy theory.\n\nFrom a big-picture viewpoint, $\\infty$-categories and their stable variant have provided *common ground for formerly separate mathematical areas*. For instance:\n\n- In **algebraic $K$-theory and motives**, a stable $\\infty$-categorical perspective allows one to treat categories of complexes (in algebraic geometry) and spectra of topological origin on equal footing. One studies \u201cnoncommutative motives\u201d by considering small stable $\\infty$-categories as the basic objects, and $K$-theory is one of the fundamental invariants in this setting (alongside others like topological cyclic homology). The fact that $K$-theory satisfies a universal property in this world\u301017\u2020L2507-L2515\u3011 means one can identify maps between $K$-theory spectra and other functors by formal arguments, something that has led to new results (e.g. the theorem that *$K$-theory is the universal *localizing* invariant of stable $\\infty$-categories*, proven using higher categories).\n\n- In **homotopy theory**, classical constructions like *spectral sequences* can be derived from filtrations in $\\infty$-categories of spectra or chain complexes. For example, a *filtered object* in a stable $\\infty$-category gives rise to a spectral sequence abutting to its homotopy groups, and this can be developed internally to the theory (Lurie\u2019s HA has an extensive discussion on filtered objects and spectral sequences in an $\\infty$-categorical context\u30104\u2020L53-L57\u3011). This unifies and clarifies many spectral sequence constructions that were previously handled on a case-by-case basis.\n\n- In **topology and geometry**, invariants like *topological modular forms (TMF)* or *elliptic cohomology* are naturally studied via categories of spectra with extra structure (e.g. $E_\\infty$-ring spectra) and their module categories. These are all handled cleanly with $\\infty$-categories. Entire new theories \u2013 like Lurie\u2019s *elliptic cohomology via derived algebraic geometry* \u2013 rely on mixing stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry in an $\\infty$-categorical way (e.g. considering the $\\infty$-category of $E_\\infty$-modules over the *tmf* spectrum, which is a stable $\\infty$-category of quasicoherent sheaves on a spectral stack).\n\nIn conclusion, the advent of $\\infty$-categories and stable $\\infty$-categories has provided mathematicians with a *powerful lingua franca* for anything involving homotopy or higher-order symmetry. As one commentator noted, if one can manage the higher categorical machinery, *\u201cgo for it\u201d* \u2013 use stable $\\infty$-categories instead of triangulated ones, since they are better-behaved and **\u201cdon\u2019t lose information\u201d**\u301013\u2020L137-L143\u3011. The initial investment in higher language is repaid by cleaner arguments and the ability to state exact universal properties. Jacob Lurie\u2019s HTT and HA books have become standard references, laying out the theory that now underpins large swathes of homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, and beyond. The role of these concepts in modern research cannot be overstated: whether it\u2019s formulating the cobordism hypothesis, classifying dualizable objects in monoidal categories, or constructing the latest generalized cohomology theory, $\\infty$-categories are likely to be involved. They provide the **unifying framework** that mathematicians of today use to **\u201cencode higher categorical and homotopical structures\u201d** and to **navigate between the classical and the modern** \u2013 from ordinary categories and cohomology theories to the vibrant world of higher categories and homotopy-coherent mathematics\u301023\u2020L634-L640\u3011\u301019\u2020L2235-L2242\u3011.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Lurie, *Higher Topos Theory* (2009) and *Higher Algebra* (2017) \u2013 foundational texts developing the theory of $(\\infty,1)$-categories, $\\infty$-topoi, and stable $\\infty$-categories, including proofs that stable $\\infty$-categories yield triangulated homotopy categories\u30104\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u30106\u2020L119-L127\u3011.  \n- Lurie, *Derived Algebraic Geometry I: Stable $\\infty$-Categories* \u2013 explains that naturally occurring triangulated categories arise as homotopy categories of stable $\\infty$-categories\u301031\u2020L228-L236\u3011 and constructs derived categories as stable $\\infty$-categories with universal properties\u30104\u2020L49-L57\u3011.  \n- Riehl\u2013Verity, *$\\infty$-Category Theory* \u2013 a modern account of the foundations and an alternative approach to some aspects of $\\infty$-categories.  \n- Blumberg\u2013Gepner\u2013Tabuada (2013), *A Universal Characterization of Higher Algebraic $K$-Theory* \u2013 uses $\\infty$-categorical techniques to characterize $K$-theory as the universal localizing invariant\u301017\u2020L2507-L2515\u3011.  \n- Barwick (2016), *On the Algebraic $K$-Theory of Higher Categories* \u2013 develops $K$-theory of Waldhausen $\\infty$-categories and discusses the additivity and localization theorems in that context.  \n- Survey by R. van Dobben de Bruyn (2019), *A Whirlwind Tour of $(\\infty,1)$-categories* \u2013 provides an accessible summary of stable $\\infty$-categories as \u201cfixing\u201d the problems of triangulated categories\u301015\u2020L2388-L2396\u3011\u301017\u2020L2460-L2468\u3011, and mentions applications in $K$-theory and derived geometry\u301017\u2020L2507-L2515\u3011\u301019\u2020L2235-L2242\u3011.  \n- ANR Project *Higher Structures in Algebra and Topology* description (Vallette et al.) \u2013 motivation for higher categories: *\u201cHomotopy theory provides natural phenomena whose description requires higher maps\u2026 after a long period of research, the theory of higher structures gave rise to manageable notions like $\\infty$-categories\u2026\u201d*\u301023\u2020L518-L527\u3011.  \n- Math StackExchange and MathOverflow discussions \u2013 various insights, e.g. *\u201cinfinity categories are better since they don\u2019t lose information, (co)limits have meaning there\u201d*\u301013\u2020L137-L143\u3011, and remarks on triangulated vs stable enhancements\u301031\u2020L228-L236\u3011."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":708,"end_ix":720,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"\n          Infinity Categories Unveiled \n    ","url":"https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/unlocking-infinity-categories-homotopy-theory#:~:text=Traditional%20Category%20Theory%20Infinity%20Category,Present%2C%20encoding%20homotopies%20between%20morphisms","text":"Traditional Category Theory Infinity Category Theory Morphisms Morphisms between objects Morphisms between objects, and between morphisms Composition Associative composition of morphisms Associative composition of morphisms, up to homotopy Higher Morphisms Not present Present, encoding homotopies between morphisms","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":33,"cited_message_id":"8a754037-22f2-4ae6-83fe-a50d546dc5c6","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"","start_line_num":83,"end_line_num":89,"connector_source":null},"og_tags":null}},{"start_ix":720,"end_ix":734,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"homotopy theory - What does it mean for a model category to present a higher category - Mathematics Stack Exchange","url":"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4808748/what-does-it-mean-for-a-model-category-to-present-a-higher-category#:~:text=The%20%24%5Cinfty%24,such%20as%20cofibrations%20and%20fibrations","text":"The $\\infty$-category presented by a model category is also called the underlying $\\infty$-category of the model category, and there are several equivalent ways to describe it.
