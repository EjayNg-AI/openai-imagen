These include self-preservation, resource acquisition, and efficiency in achieving objectives.\n- **Example**: An AI with the goal of maximizing paperclips and an AI with the goal of curing cancer might both pursue self-preservation, computational efficiency, and resource accumulation because these instrumental goals help achieve their respective objectives.\n\n### **Key Distinction**\n- **Epistemic convergence** is about agents arriving at the same understanding of the world.\n- **Instrumental convergence** is about agents adopting similar behaviors, even if their ultimate objectives are different.\n\nWould you like a deeper theoretical breakdown or some applied AI-related examples?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002,200007]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"db6834b7-48a0-483f-8d55-2355dcab1b33","request_id":"9110ffc369bfcdfe-IAD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"db6834b7-48a0-483f-8d55-2355dcab1b33","children":[]}}}
