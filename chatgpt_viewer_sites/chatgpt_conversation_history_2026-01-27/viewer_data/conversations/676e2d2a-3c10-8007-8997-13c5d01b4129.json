This advancement aims to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, competing with OpenAI\u2019s o1 reasoning model. The chief scientist of Google DeepMind, Jeff Dean, showcased its ability to tackle physics problems by breaking them down into manageable steps. Additionally, Google product lead Logan Kilpatrick highlighted the model\u2019s proficiency in solving problems that integrate visual and textual elements.
