cloud outage: online services hit, recovery uneven","snippet":"On October 20, 2025, Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major cloud outage, primarily affecting its US-EAST-1 data center region in northern Virginia. This disruption interfered with a wide array of online services across sectors including finance, social media, gaming, e-commerce, and education. The issue stemmed from a Domain Name System (DNS) problem that blocked access to DynamoDB\u2019s API due to failures within AWS\u2019s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) internal network.\n\nThe outage impacted popular services like Amazon, Prime Video, Snapchat, Reddit, Venmo, Lyft, Fortnite, and Duolingo. Despite being gradually resolved, this incident highlighted the fragility of global digital infrastructure. AWS has suffered previous outages, notably in June 2023 and December 2021, also centered on its US-EAST-1 region. AWS, serving over a million customers monthly, reported $30.9 billion in revenue in Q2 2025, underlining the scale and critical role of its infrastructure in powering the modern internet.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1760982749.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-assets-hit-record-1346-trillion-third-quarter-markets-rally-2025-10-14/","title":"BlackRock's assets hit record $13.46 trillion on third-quarter markets rally","snippet":"BlackRock reported a surge in its third-quarter profits for 2025, driven by a strong rally in global markets that boosted fee income and increased its assets under management to a record $13.46 trillion, up from $11.48 trillion a year earlier. Investor enthusiasm was fueled by resilient U.S. consumer spending, moderating inflation, and the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year in September. These factors triggered significant inflows into BlackRock\u2019s lower-cost index and fixed-income exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a key area of growth for the firm. Despite increased costs from acquiring HPS Investment Partners and softer performance fees, BlackRock saw long-term net inflows of $171 billion, highlighting the strength of its ETF business. Adjusted net income rose to $1.91 billion, or $11.55 per share, up from $1.72 billion, or $11.46 per share, in the same period last year.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1760436367.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/2c01c70c-23f3-48d5-b3e3-97848d29be4a","title":"BlackRock's assets surge to $13.5tn","snippet":"BlackRock's assets under management rose to a record $13.5 trillion in Q3 2025, driven by $205 billion in new client inflows and strong performance in global markets. Its iShares ETF platform surpassed $5 trillion, underlining its continuing growth. BlackRock has also significantly expanded its private markets footprint through nearly $30 billion in acquisitions of Global Infrastructure Partners, HPS Investment Partners, and Preqin. These moves contributed to $13.2 billion in new private market investments, including $7.9 billion in private credit, while its private markets unit now manages $321 billion and generated $951 million in quarterly fees, making up about 15% of total revenue.\n\nDespite a 19% drop in reported net profit to $1.3 billion due to acquisition-related costs, adjusted net income reached $1.9 billion. Revenue rose 25% year-over-year to $6.5 billion, beating analyst estimates. CEO Larry Fink emphasized growing opportunities in the convergence of public and private markets, highlighting BlackRock\u2019s strategic shift from ETF dominance toward expanding in private assets and technology.

This follows a net income of $58.8 billion in 2022. The Fed emphasized that such losses do not hinder its operational or monetary policy capabilities. The Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes starting in spring 2022, aimed at controlling inflation, significantly increased its interest expenses. Interest expenses on banks' reserve balances rose to $176.8 billion, and payouts from the reverse repo facility increased to $104.3 billion.

It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets. Reasons for negative shareholders' equity include accumulated losses, large dividend payments, borrowing money, and amortization of intangible assets. Young companies might initially have negative equity due to borrowing for growth but could stabilize over time. Established companies with negative equity indicate significant financial instability and require careful evaluation. Notable companies, such as McDonald's and Starbucks, have experienced negative equity, but others like Lehman Brothers and Hertz filed for bankruptcy when they faced the same situation. Negative shareholders' equity signifies a risk and warrants a thorough investigation before investing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1222966800.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f6e595e828832fb1d6a128bfb7d1bb","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for U.S. corporate equity issuance data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"37bcee34-014c-4c7b-9438-ae22ce4e2bb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"025009ce-88f9-4d6c-a31b-3627f01093ff","turn_exchange_id":"26322a16-ffda-4efe-904d-06885dc07626","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"025009ce-88f9-4d6c-a31b-3627f01093ff","children":["6f904b5a-dd67-4d85-9d8b-f651b85a129d"]},"6f904b5a-dd67-4d85-9d8b-f651b85a129d":{"id":"6f904b5a-dd67-4d85-9d8b-f651b85a129d","message":{"id":"6f904b5a-dd67-4d85-9d8b-f651b85a129d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761011117.173087,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Being selective","content":"I\u2019m considering which pieces are most relevant for the task.

According to Synergy Research Group, U.S. giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google now command 70% of the European cloud market, while European providers retain just 15%, down from 29% in 2017. Although that 15% has stabilized since 2022, the market continues to be fiercely competitive. Size and investment are key factors in cloud success; U.S. companies are spending billions in Europe to expand infrastructure and support AI-driven demand. Microsoft alone is investing $80 billion globally, with significant portions allocated to European operations. European firms like SAP and Deutsche Telekom hold only 2% shares each, primarily serving local niche markets or partnering with U.S. providers. Sovereign cloud projects and regulatory challenges reflect growing concerns around data sovereignty.

Amazon disputes these concerns, labeling them as misunderstandings. Both Amazon and Microsoft have expressed willingness to cooperate with the investigation, expected to conclude by April 2025.

The data center systems segment is expected to see a dramatic 42.4% growth, marking it as the fastest-growing area due to heightened demand for AI-optimized servers, which now significantly outpace traditional server spending. Software spending is also projected to exceed the average growth rate at 10.5%, while other sectors such as devices (5.4%), IT services (4.4%), and communication services (2.1%) will show modest gains. Despite this expansion, overall IT spending growth is only slightly higher than 2024\u2019s 7.4%, influenced by geopolitical uncertainties that delay new projects. Budgets remain intact but are being carefully evaluated, particularly for hardware and infrastructure, which could be impacted by market volatility.

While precious metals have surged significantly\u2014gold up 50%\u2014and some analysts point to growing U.S. debt and Federal Reserve rate cuts as evidence of dollar debasement, the bond and currency markets tell a different story. Treasury yields have fallen, not risen, and inflation expectations based on TIPS are low. The dollar, while weaker early in the year, has been relatively stable and even outperforming peers recently. Experts argue that major outflows from the dollar or Treasuries, which would mark true debasement fears, are not apparent. Instead, the asset rallies may stem from diversification strategies, momentum buying, or political uncertainty, rather than a broad loss of confidence in the U.S. economy. Thus, the article suggests that the \"debasement trade\" may be more narrative than reality, and market behavior doesn't fully support fears of systemic dollar debasement.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1760965622.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/wealth/us-bond-investors-weigh-convexity-risk-recent-treasury-yield-decline-2025-03-25/","title":"US bond investors weigh 'convexity' risk in recent Treasury yield decline","snippet":"The drop in U.S. Treasury yields has led to speculation that 'convexity' buying by mortgage portfolio managers and insurance companies contributed to the decline. Convexity buying helps offset the impact of mortgage refinancing when interest rates fall. The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield influencing various borrows has not moved significantly since bottoming at 4.10% in early March after a substantial decline. Convexity hedging is always occurring but varies in intensity, especially when rates fall, leading to shifts in mortgage holdings to balance portfolios. Currently, about 64% of outstanding mortgages are locked in at rates below 4%, but 16% with rates above 6% could be quickly refinanced. For portfolios, investors counter negative MBS convexity by purchasing Treasuries, Treasury futures, or engaging in interest rate swaps. Active MBS hedgers have significantly decreased since their peak in 2002, which likely limits the impact of convexity moves. Additionally, recent tightening in the spread between 10-year interest rate swaps and Treasury yields signifies active convexity hedging, raising short-term implied volatility in longer-dated swaptions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1742897367.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2021/03/rates-growth-and-value-investment.html","title":"Interest Rates, Earning Growth and Equity Value","snippet":"Mar 25, 2021 \u2014 Bond rate declining to close to 0.70%.

Unlike traditional Treasury bonds, TIPS adjust their principal based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). As inflation rises, the bond\u2019s principal increases, which in turn raises the interest payments since they are calculated on the adjusted principal. In deflationary periods, the principal decreases, reducing interest payments, but investors are guaranteed to receive at least the original principal at maturity.\n\nTIPS are issued in five-, ten-, and thirty-year terms, and can be purchased directly from the U.S. Treasury through TreasuryDirect or via brokers and mutual funds/ETFs. Their lower initial interest rates and potential tax implications (as interest and inflation-adjusted increases are federally taxed) are cons to consider. However, they are ideal for retirees, conservative investors, and long-term savers who want to preserve purchasing power.\n\nDespite being intended for inflation protection, TIPS underperformed in 2022 due to rising interest rates. They are best used as part of a long-term investment strategy rather than short-term inflation hedges. While yields can be negative in real terms, TIPS remain popular due to their government backing and inflation-indexed returns.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1069693200.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f6e595e828832fb1d6a128bfb7d1bb","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Damodaran insights on rates and valuations","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"37bcee34-014c-4c7b-9438-ae22ce4e2bb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"8f70ab90-0021-4a34-b155-3c63fdaf7ce5","turn_exchange_id":"26322a16-ffda-4efe-904d-06885dc07626","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8f70ab90-0021-4a34-b155-3c63fdaf7ce5","children":["fd369ee4-e684-4418-83ee-ba188e854f70"]},"fd369ee4-e684-4418-83ee-ba188e854f70":{"id":"fd369ee4-e684-4418-83ee-ba188e854f70","message":{"id":"fd369ee4-e684-4418-83ee-ba188e854f70","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761011136.754139,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring capital and markups","content":"Next, I\u2019ll focus on intangible capital and markups.

Corporate profit margins increased from 13.4% in late 2019 to 17% by mid-2022, driven by pandemic-related supply constraints. Although supply issues have mostly been resolved, profit margins remained high at 16.4% in 2023, the highest since the 1960s outside the pandemic period. High margins can contribute to inflation by keeping prices elevated even when costs decrease, a pattern confirmed by research suggesting that prices rise quickly with increasing costs but fall slowly when costs decrease. Biden's focus on corporate greed aligns with a broader narrative of holding companies accountable, similar to historical figures like Teddy Roosevelt.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1710408600.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/profitability-is-next-sacrifice-inflation-altar-2024-04-02/","title":"Profitability is next sacrifice at inflation altar","snippet":"The battle against inflation involves central bankers like Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde urging corporate leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bernard Arnault, not to transfer rising wage costs to consumers, as it could reignite price increases. This pressure on companies is expected to dampen profitability. The spike in corporate profits post-pandemic and amid geopolitical tension has significantly contributed to inflation. For example, companies like Exxon Mobil and PepsiCo recorded unprecedented profits while inflation surged. Central banks are now intervening, with a focus on keeping wage growth in check to prevent further inflation. Despite a slight decline in euro zone corporate profitability, U.S. companies' margins remain high, complicating the Fed's efforts to manage inflation. Ultimately, central banks seem poised to keep interest rates high until corporate profit margins decrease, hoping to achieve a deflationary effect.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1712055595.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f6e595e828832fb1d6a128bfb7d1bb","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for superstar firms and intangible capital trends","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"37bcee34-014c-4c7b-9438-ae22ce4e2bb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"fdb07cd7-c256-43d1-addf-2a82efa61efb","turn_exchange_id":"26322a16-ffda-4efe-904d-06885dc07626","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fdb07cd7-c256-43d1-addf-2a82efa61efb","children":["c6a828ea-4832-4a17-b53a-4127dec77e9d"]},"c6a828ea-4832-4a17-b53a-4127dec77e9d":{"id":"c6a828ea-4832-4a17-b53a-4127dec77e9d","message":{"id":"c6a828ea-4832-4a17-b53a-4127dec77e9d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761011141.988395,"update_time":1761011141.997942,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"Brokerages zero commission trading 2019 Schwab Robinhood timeline zero commissions\"}, {\"q\": \"payment for order flow growth 2019 2021 SEC report\"}, {\"q\": \"Retail trading surge 2020 pandemic households stock market $ government stimulus research\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"Brokerages zero commission trading 2019 Schwab Robinhood timeline zero commissions"},{"type":"search","q":"payment for order flow growth 2019 2021 SEC report"},{"type":"search","q":"Retail trading surge 2020 pandemic households stock market $ government stimulus research"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching mobile trading and gamification trends post-2019","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"37bcee34-014c-4c7b-9438-ae22ce4e2bb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"b87bfe7c-80b8-4f5e-a3f6-7de81b3d92c1","turn_exchange_id":"26322a16-ffda-4efe-904d-06885dc07626","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"b87bfe7c-80b8-4f5e-a3f6-7de81b3d92c1","children":["d3d2f264-5122-4eb3-b8bf-496ff7d522d6"]},"d3d2f264-5122-4eb3-b8bf-496ff7d522d6":{"id":"d3d2f264-5122-4eb3-b8bf-496ff7d522d6","message":{"id":"d3d2f264-5122-4eb3-b8bf-496ff7d522d6","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1761011142.1203227,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_model_queries":{"type":"search_model_queries","queries":["Brokerages zero commission trading 2019 Schwab Robinhood timeline zero commissions","payment for order flow growth 2019 2021 SEC report","Retail trading surge 2020 pandemic households stock market $ government stimulus research"]},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching mobile trading and gamification trends post-2019","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"37bcee34-014c-4c7b-9438-ae22ce4e2bb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c6a828ea-4832-4a17-b53a-4127dec77e9d","turn_exchange_id":"26322a16-ffda-4efe-904d-06885dc07626","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c6a828ea-4832-4a17-b53a-4127dec77e9d","children":["f79d7d63-a2f8-455c-9a61-77c9c2a255f8"]},"f79d7d63-a2f8-455c-9a61-77c9c2a255f8":{"id":"f79d7d63-a2f8-455c-9a61-77c9c2a255f8","message":{"id":"f79d7d63-a2f8-455c-9a61-77c9c2a255f8","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1761011142.1158054,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wtwealthmanagement.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wtwealthmanagement.com/whitepapers/2020-07/","title":"WT Wealth Management - The History of Zero Commissions","snippet":"...

Previously, brokers had gradually reduced commissions and expanded commission-free trades on select exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The recent move to eliminate stock and ETF commissions removes a key revenue source but brokers still generate income through other means such as interest on idle cash, options trading fees, and payment for order flow. While free trading benefits customers by reducing costs, brokers leverage services like cash sweep programs, managed accounts, and lending stock to short sellers to maintain revenue.\n\nThe reduction in trading commissions primarily stimulates market participation by new investors, emphasizing that zero commissions are not necessarily an end goal but part of broader revenue strategies in place by brokers. Established firms, capable of integrating multiple financial services under one umbrella, are well-positioned to benefit. Schwab's strategic focus on removing commission barriers aligns with a growing trend of commission-free investing as an entry point for individuals seeking to invest small amounts for long-term financial goals.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1571356258.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.sciencedirect.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176523003956","title":"Investment behavior of retail investors in response to ...","snippet":"by W Jung \u00b7 2023 \u00b7 Cited by 1 \u2014 This study investigates the impact of Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) on retail stock trading and the stock market using Robinhood data.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.sciencedirect.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426624001432","title":"How free is free?

Retail investors' share of equity order flows rose significantly, and platforms like eToro saw massive user growth. Many retail traders began investing in stock options, amplifying price movements.\n\nThis newfound retail activity targeted struggling companies like GameStop, sparking a price surge of over 1600% that caught Wall Street off guard. Conversations on forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets played a major role in driving hype and coordination among these individual investors. Hedge funds like Melvin Capital, heavily shorting GameStop, suffered major losses as retail investors triggered a short squeeze, forcing institutional traders to buy back shares at inflated prices.\n\nWhile some investors profited, analysts warned of asset bubbles and the risks of speculative trading, especially with margin lending. If the market turned, retail investors heavily exposed to overvalued stocks or debt could face significant financial losses.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1611800347.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/robinhoods-vlad-tenev-has-led-a-trading-revolution-to-become-a-new-wall-street-power-6a73bf9b","title":"Robinhood's Vlad Tenev has led a trading revolution to become a new Wall Street power","snippet":"Vlad Tenev, co-founder and CEO of Robinhood, has spearheaded a retail trading revolution, transforming his company into a dominant force on Wall Street. Since launching commission-free mobile trading in 2013, Robinhood has accrued 25.9 million active accounts and a market valuation of $73 billion in 2025. Tenev foresaw the shift toward mobile and active investing, capitalizing on rising smartphone use and dissatisfaction with traditional brokerages. His innovation, notably the \"payment for order flow\" model, pressured competitors like TD Ameritrade and E-Trade to eliminate trading fees, sparking a surge in retail investing.\n\nDespite early meteoric growth, Robinhood faced challenges, including platform outages and regulatory scrutiny, particularly after the 2021 meme-stock trading freeze. The company adapted by expanding into crypto, launching a premium subscription service, and enhancing its platform with features like 24-hour trading and educational tools.\n\nAfter posting its first profitable year in 2024 with $3 billion in revenue, Robinhood has regained user trust and solidified its status in the financial landscape. Tenev now collaborates with the U.S. government on initiatives like \"Invest America,\" aiming to empower future generations with early exposure to investing, underscoring his vision of a financial system increasingly driven by retail participation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1751137860.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f6e595e828832fb1d6a128bfb7d1bb","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching mobile trading and gamification trends post-2019","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"37bcee34-014c-4c7b-9438-ae22ce4e2bb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d3d2f264-5122-4eb3-b8bf-496ff7d522d6","turn_exchange_id":"26322a16-ffda-4efe-904d-06885dc07626","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d3d2f264-5122-4eb3-b8bf-496ff7d522d6","children":["dbb059bb-2843-45bd-b76d-a21a4345c805"]},"dbb059bb-2843-45bd-b76d-a21a4345c805":{"id":"dbb059bb-2843-45bd-b76d-a21a4345c805","message":{"id":"dbb059bb-2843-45bd-b76d-a21a4345c805","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761011150.877012,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering indexing and flows","content":"Some sources may be a bit sensational, but we can definitely use the SEC staff report.

should back the AI maximalists'","snippet":"The article argues that despite prevailing skepticism in the UK investment community about the sustainability of the AI-driven tech rally, investors should support \"AI maximalists\" who see artificial intelligence as a transformative technology rather than a speculative bubble. The UK's investors largely anticipate a repeat of the 2000 tech crash, whereas in the US, the dominance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks in the S&P 500 is underpinned by strong earnings. Ben Rogoff, who manages the \u00a35 billion Polar Capital Technology Trust, holds a bullish view on AI and has structured the trust\u2019s portfolio accordingly, leading to significant outperformance in recent months.\n\nRogoff emphasizes that transformative periods inherently involve volatility, comparing the current AI boom to past industrial revolutions. He highlights rapid growth in AI adoption, corporate spending, and its long-term disruptive potential. Despite criticisms and perceived risks, Rogoff sees AI as offering unprecedented opportunities akin to 19th-century railroads. The trust\u2019s diversified portfolio is heavily weighted toward large-cap US tech firms and remains selective, excluding companies without strong AI positioning. Ultimately, the article suggests that dismissing the AI revolution could be a costly mistake for investors.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1760694848.0,"attribution":"moneyweek.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.barrons.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/s-p-500-russell-2000-megacaps-small-caps-diversify-ddeabad1","title":"Breaking Up With Big Tech Is Hard to Do. How to Truly Diversify.","snippet":"A recent report by DataTrek Research reveals that the S&P 1500, which includes small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks, offers little diversification compared to the S&P 500. The top 10 holdings\u2014dominated by big tech firms, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase\u2014represent a similar market weight in both indices: 40.5% in the S&P 500 and 37.5% in the S&P 1500. Sector composition also remains largely the same, with technology stocks comprising over 33% of the S&P 1500. Consequently, passive index ETFs tied to the S&P 1500 do not offer significant diversification away from tech-driven large caps. \n\nDespite only slightly lower returns compared to the S&P 500, small- and mid-cap stocks remain attractive due to lower valuations and potential for gains. The Russell 2000 is up 12.8% in 2025 and shows strong momentum, while the S&P Small Cap 600 is also positive. Experts suggest actively investing in smaller companies, which are trading at lower P/E ratios compared to the large-cap-heavy S&P 1500. Popular small- and mid-cap holdings include Sprouts Farmers Market and Cal-Maine Foods. Ultimately, true diversification may require looking beyond traditional broad-market ETFs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1760550300.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.spglobal.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500-top-10-index/","title":"S&P 500 Top 10 Index | S&P Dow Jones Indices","snippet":"The S&P 500 Top 10 Index consists of 10 of the largest companies from the S&P 500.

(TSMC) is accelerating its 2nm chip production timeline in Arizona, driven by strong AI-related demand from U.S.-based clients. CEO C.C. Wei noted that the company is upgrading its technologies more quickly than planned and hinted at further expansion, including the potential acquisition of additional land near its existing Arizona facility. This move suggests a build-out of a complete Gigafab cluster capable of producing 100,000 12-inch wafers monthly, including packaging, testing, and support infrastructure.\n\nOriginally, 2nm production was set to begin by 2030, but due to rising demand, particularly from companies like Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom, TSMC plans to advance the timeline by roughly a year. The expansion is part of TSMC\u2019s broader investment in the U.S., which already includes a $165 billion commitment. Furthermore, to support future workforce needs, TSMC is growing its internship program in Arizona, increasing available slots from 130 to 200. Despite global semiconductor supply chain uncertainties due to the U.S.-China trade tensions, TSMC remains confident in long-term demand, particularly from AI and consumer electronics segments.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1760702487.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tsmc.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/technology/logic/l_7nm","title":"7nm Technology","snippet":"TSMC's 7nm (N7) technology started volume production in 2018, is fast, and used for mobile and HPC.

By 2035, 5G could generate 22.3 million jobs and $13.2 trillion in economic output. The United States led the way, with the FCC opening high-band spectrums and major carriers like AT&T and Verizon rolling out 5G in numerous cities. South Korea is at the forefront with 5G in 85 cities, thanks to collaboration among carriers SK Telecom, LG Uplus, and KT Corp. Sweden and Estonia began 5G tests in 2018, focusing on IoT and industry digitalization. Turkey, still in trial phases, aims to boost domestic production with affordable tech services. Japan launched 5G by 2020, spearheaded by NTT DOCOMO's early efforts and government support, promising speeds 100 times faster than LTE.

This progress contrasts with a 4% overall increase in global emissions during the same period. Energy efficiency improvements and a shift toward renewables, such as solar and battery storage, contributed to this reduction, alongside discontinuing outdated networks and diesel generators. Regional leaders included Europe, North America, and Latin America, which achieved emission cuts of 56%, 44%, and 36%, respectively. China, the world's largest mobile market, recorded a 4% decline in 2024 alone. However, the industry must accelerate its efforts to achieve a 7.5% annual reduction through 2030 to stay aligned with net-zero goals. Scope 3 emissions\u2014mainly from supply chains\u2014remain a challenge, while increased consumer interest in circularity and refurbished phones, which generate up to 90% fewer emissions, offers promising potential. The refurbished market is projected to reach $150 billion by 2027. Sustaining progress requires broader support, including improved access to renewable energy, clear policy guidance, and stronger collaboration across the industry ecosystem.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1750502040.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f6e595e828832fb1d6a128bfb7d1bb","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching mobile network adoption and streaming advancements","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"37bcee34-014c-4c7b-9438-ae22ce4e2bb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"ca146a7f-dd6c-48d8-9b0f-170b864e08c2","turn_exchange_id":"26322a16-ffda-4efe-904d-06885dc07626","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ca146a7f-dd6c-48d8-9b0f-170b864e08c2","children":["2e24b7eb-e052-4d71-bf35-7c496856ece2"]},"2e24b7eb-e052-4d71-bf35-7c496856ece2":{"id":"2e24b7eb-e052-4d71-bf35-7c496856ece2","message":{"id":"2e24b7eb-e052-4d71-bf35-7c496856ece2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761011174.308772,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering savings glut and neutral rate","content":"Alright, I\u2019ll explore the global savings glut and neutral interest rates (r*).

The fine follows a ruling the previous day by French and Dutch courts that Facebook violated European data privacy standards, resulting in a sanction of \u20ac150,000. When acquiring WhatsApp, Facebook assured the EU that it wouldn't combine user data from both platforms. However, in 2016, Facebook announced the use of WhatsApp's data for targeted ads, which contradicts their earlier statements. Although Facebook claims the errors were unintentional, Europe\u2019s stringent stance on tech companies' privacy and antitrust practices indicates growing regulatory challenges for U.S. tech firms operating in European markets. Despite the fines being relatively small in comparison to Facebook's $27 billion annual revenue, the increased scrutiny may constrain its expansion efforts, potentially shifting focus to emerging markets.","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1495139269.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/4ce636d2-8438-4a68-821b-74dc7a150d52","title":"Meta had 'monopoly power' after buying rival apps, FTC says","snippet":"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched a high-profile antitrust trial against Meta, formerly Facebook, accusing the tech giant of gaining \"monopoly power\" through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014. The FTC's lawyer, Daniel Matheson, argued that Meta's purchases stifled competition and allowed the company to dominate the social media market, citing internal communications from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that revealed concerns about potential threats from these rival apps. Meta is said to have 85% of market share in app usage, though the company disputes this, claiming its share drops below 30% when factoring in competitors like TikTok and YouTube. The trial is seen as a major test of the Trump administration's willingness to challenge Big Tech, under new FTC chair Andrew Ferguson. If Meta is found guilty, it could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta has denied monopolistic practices, arguing that competition remains fierce and that it improved the platforms while keeping them free. Analysts note the FTC faces challenges, especially after the initial case was dismissed in 2021 for lacking sufficient legal ground. Key figures expected to testify include Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and leaders from rival companies.","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1744662680.72,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"time.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/122900/facebook-looks-to-eu-to-avoid-whatsapp-antitrust-headaches/","title":"Facebook Seeks EU Approval of WhatsApp Deal to Avoid Antitrust Headaches","snippet":"Facebook has requested an antitrust review by the European Commission for its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp. This strategy aims to circumvent potential antitrust investigations from multiple European countries where national telecom companies might push for the deal to be blocked.

Although buybacks rose in dollar terms, they now represent a smaller percentage of the overall S&P 500 index value due to recent stock surges.

This prediction is driven by robust earnings in Big Tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta Platforms. For 2024, S&P 500 buybacks are expected to reach $925 billion, marking a 13% annual increase. The trend is anticipated to continue into 2025 with a projected 16% rise to $1.075 trillion. Earnings growth, particularly from megacap tech companies, and a favorable economic outlook are cited as primary drivers. The Magnificent Seven, which includes tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, are expected to significantly contribute to this buyback surge. Additionally, falling Treasury yields and potential Fed rate cuts in mid-2024 are poised to create more conducive conditions for buybacks. Although some companies, such as Meta, have initiated dividends, the trend towards increased buybacks remains strong, with Big Tech companies authorized to repurchase substantial amounts of their stock.","ref_id":{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1710163959.0,"attribution":"www.investors.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/39a6c6c4-a2f5-4ce5-96bb-0c542f6521da","title":"Retail traders plough $67bn into US stocks while investment giants flee","snippet":"In 2025, individual investors have directed nearly $70 billion into US stocks, contrasting with large investment firms that are reducing their market exposure due to concerns over President Donald Trump's policies.

pressures persist in China on weak demand, overcapacity","snippet":"Deflationary pressures continue to challenge China's economy, with both consumer (CPI) and producer prices (PPI) falling in September 2025, signaling muted domestic demand and overcapacity. The CPI dropped 0.3% year-on-year, slightly less than August's 0.4% decline, while the PPI fell 2.3%, narrowing from a 2.9% fall in the previous month. Food prices, especially pork, declined significantly amid weak demand and government measures to curb oversupply. Despite a rebound in exports, renewed trade tensions with the U.S. and a sluggish property sector are weighing heavily on consumer confidence.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes food and fuel, rose to 1%, a 19-month high, indicating some underlying price stability. However, the combination of falling prices and slowing holiday spending suggests weak consumer sentiment. Economists suggest that while policymakers are increasingly concerned about deflation, their current supply-side strategies may not succeed without stronger demand-side interventions.\n\nPrevious government efforts, including rate cuts and liquidity injections, have yet to reverse deflationary trends, and further monetary easing is anticipated, possibly in November.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) dropped by 3.6% year-on-year, surpassing May\u2019s 3.3% decline and reflecting the deepest fall since July 2023. Ongoing trade uncertainties, driven in part by U.S. tariffs from President Trump, have dampened export expectations and pressured export-oriented industries. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) slightly increased by 0.1%, its first rise in five months, helped by a rebound in industrial consumer goods prices. However, domestic demand remains sluggish amid a protracted housing slump, prompting businesses to offer heavy price discounts and policymakers to consider further stimulus. E-commerce giants like Alibaba and JD.com have launched aggressive subsidy strategies to boost market share. While core inflation rose to 0.7%, the highest in over a year, analysts foresee a potential easing of inflation and expect China's central bank to cut interest rates again in the fourth quarter to support the economy. Market responses to the data were cautious, with mixed movements on Chinese stock indices.","ref_id":{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1752033210.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.elibrary.imf.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2024/062/article-A001-en.xml","title":"Global Value Chains and Inflation Dynamics in","snippet":"Mar 22, 2024 \u2014 At the beginning of the pandemic, the downward pressure on prices due to lost demand overwhelms the upward price pressure due to supply ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.elibrary.imf.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.elibrary.imf.org/downloadpdf/view/journals/001/2024/062/001.2024.issue-062-en.pdf","title":"Global Value Chains and Inflation Dynamics","snippet":"At the beginning of the pandemic, the downward pressure on prices due to lost demand overwhelms the upward price pressure due to supply chain disruptions ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.elibrary.imf.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"mitsloan.mit.edu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents?DocumentID=2731","title":"Trade Induced Technical Change?

This decline was attributed to reduced prices of Chinese goods despite record-high export volumes, challenging Beijing's efforts to invigorate the economy amidst a property sector slump. Overcapacity, particularly in sectors favored by industrial policy like electric vehicles and solar panels, has driven prices down, benefiting China's global market share but alarming foreign competitors. Seasonal effects from the Lunar New Year and exchange rate factors also influenced the export figures. Meanwhile, China aims to boost domestic demand and meet its 5% GDP growth target for 2024, countering accusations of overcapacity and dumping cheap goods abroad.

A strong content slate, including hits like \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d and the second season of \u201cWednesday,\u201d is expected to drive Netflix\u2019s biggest revenue boost in over four years. However, some analysts worry about the streamer\u2019s long-term growth potential, especially after it ceased reporting subscriber counts and pivoted attention to financial metrics.\n\nNetflix has invested around $1 billion into building its gaming venture, offering over 120 mobile titles, yet it has seen minimal impact on user engagement\u2014less than a 0.5% increase in time spent, per Omdia. Analysts note Netflix\u2019s lack of iconic IP as a barrier to gaming success, unlike competitors such as Warner Bros. Discovery.

In the fourth quarter, Prime Video saw a 35% increase in subscribers, reaching 7.14 million homes. This surge was Amazon's best performance since its UK launch six years ago. Despite Netflix leading the UK market with 12.35 million subscribers and 20% annual growth, Amazon capitalized on popular shows and sports content to attract new subscribers. Notably, Amazon gained 1.86 million new users in 2019, the most substantial annual increase since 2014. Meanwhile, Now TV, Sky's streaming service, experienced an 8% subscriber drop between the third and fourth quarters, ending the year with 1.69 million subscribers. For the first time, over half of UK households held subscriptions to at least one of these services, with 14.3 million homes subscribing to either Netflix, Prime Video, or Now TV.","ref_id":{"turn_index":16,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1582207471.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"time.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/98987/netflix-streaming-traffic/","title":"Netflix Crowned King of Streaming With More Than a Third of Peak Traffic","snippet":"Netflix has become the predominant streaming service, accounting for over 34% of peak wired download traffic in North America, an increase from 31.6% in late 2013, according to Sandvine. The next closest service, YouTube, reaches only 13.19%. This growth bodes well as Netflix plans a price increase for new subscribers. In mobile networks, YouTube leads with 17.26% traffic, with Netflix far behind at 4.55%. The rise in Netflix's usage reflects the growing trend of cord cutting, where users prefer streaming services over traditional pay-TV. Cord cutters now average 212GB of data per month and stream about 100 hours of video, accounting for 53.9% of total traffic. This trend alarms TV networks and providers, who are responding with their own internet video packages. However, a positive outcome for the industry is the decline in file-sharing traffic, now only 8.3%, down from 31% six years ago.","ref_id":{"turn_index":16,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1400082119.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f6e595e828832fb1d6a128bfb7d1bb","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Apple App Store and streaming market growth","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"37bcee34-014c-4c7b-9438-ae22ce4e2bb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"87d86420-a690-4ed2-935d-a874ecd13674","turn_exchange_id":"26322a16-ffda-4efe-904d-06885dc07626","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"87d86420-a690-4ed2-935d-a874ecd13674","children":["1fad0883-8f0a-43c5-a72e-8fb6ffb2f1f0"]},"1fad0883-8f0a-43c5-a72e-8fb6ffb2f1f0":{"id":"1fad0883-8f0a-43c5-a72e-8fb6ffb2f1f0","message":{"id":"1fad0883-8f0a-43c5-a72e-8fb6ffb2f1f0","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761011204.665458,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering digital transformation","content":"Next, I want to focus on how enterprise digital transformation sped up in the 2010s, boosting margins and productivity.

Venture capitalists in the U.S. have spent $161 billion on AI so far in 2025, accounting for two-thirds of their total funding. Companies with modest revenue, like $5 million in annual recurring revenue, are commanding valuations exceeding $500 million \u2014 multiples that surpass even the 2021 investment highs.\n\nKey investors argue that bubbles, while risky, are necessary for technological revolutions, pointing to major historical tech gains following speculative investment periods. While some fear unrealistic valuations and widespread losses, others believe AI's potential, especially with aspirations toward artificial general intelligence (AGI), justifies the risk. OpenAI, for instance, has seen explosive annual revenue growth to $13 billion just three years after launching ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, the heavy dependence of public markets on private AI companies adds systemic risk \u2014 deals with chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have influenced their stock valuations based on AI demand projections.

In response, both the Trump and Biden administrations implemented numerous fiscal policies, while the Federal Reserve deployed a variety of monetary policies to stabilize the economy. The Fed's measures included interest rate cuts, quantitative easing, repurchase operations, and the creation of special funding facilities to ensure liquidity and credit availability. Significant federal relief packages, such as the CARES Act, facilitated direct financial support to individuals and businesses through stimulus checks, unemployment benefits, and loans. Later legislation, including the American Rescue Plan Act, continued to provide substantial financial assistance. Despite these efforts, federal stimulus checks ended in 2022, with some states continuing limited stimulus programs. Post-pandemic, strategies evolved to address rising inflation and economic recovery, marking significant fiscal and monetary efforts to mitigate the pandemic's economic damage.","ref_id":{"turn_index":19,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1584138428.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tapering.asp","title":"Tapering: How, Why, and When the Fed Does It and Impact on Financial Markets","snippet":"Tapering is the process by which central banks reduce the monetary stimulus they provided to boost economic recovery. It usually follows a quantitative easing (QE) program where the central bank purchases assets to inject money into the economy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) may taper by changing the discount rate, reserve requirements, or reducing its asset holdings. Communicating tapering plans transparently helps set market expectations and minimize uncertainty. However, announcements of tapering often lead to increased bond yields and decreased equity markets, known as \"taper tantrums.\"\n\nThe Fed's tapering response to the COVID-19 pandemic included reducing asset purchases and stopping \"easy money\" policies, shifting to manage rising costs. The process began in December 2021, with significant asset holdings reductions by June 2022.\n\nTapering is distinct from tightening, which involves raising interest rates and selling assets to slow down economic growth and curb inflation. The shift to tapering can help prevent asset bubbles and inflation if handled gradually to avoid triggering a recession, as demonstrated following the 2007-2008 financial crisis.","ref_id":{"turn_index":19,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1385991000.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.axios.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/2020/12/16/fed-bond-buying","title":"Fed pledges to continue buying bonds until economy makes \"substantial\" progress","snippet":"The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain current interest rates at 0%-0.25% and continue purchasing at least $120 billion in bonds monthly until significant progress is made towards maximum employment and price stability goals.

Although stock prices initially dropped after the announcement, they rose during Powell\u2019s press conference. The Fed believes bond purchases support market function and credit flow. Powell downplayed concerns about high stock price levels by relating current valuation metrics to historically low Treasury returns.

The proposal includes raising $4.7 trillion through increased taxes on the wealthy and corporations and $800 billion in savings from program changes. Biden's plan also includes $2.6 trillion in new spending on programs benefiting the middle class, families, and the elderly. Key features include restoring the expanded child tax credit, capping insulin prices, and adjusting taxes on the wealthy. Biden's proposal aims to support programs without raising taxes on those earning under $400,000 and contends that GOP lawmakers have yet to provide a counteroffer, maintaining their calls for a balanced budget without specifying spending cuts or increased revenues. The budget reflects tensions in U.S. economic policy, including the potential expiration of Trump-era tax cuts and the need to address the national debt, which could exacerbate an already fragile economy if no agreement is reached.","ref_id":{"turn_index":21,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1678343128.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f6e595e828832fb1d6a128bfb7d1bb","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for 2023 buyback tax details and proposals","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"37bcee34-014c-4c7b-9438-ae22ce4e2bb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"07d48b9c-7833-4ed9-b306-6fba628d53a9","turn_exchange_id":"26322a16-ffda-4efe-904d-06885dc07626","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"07d48b9c-7833-4ed9-b306-6fba628d53a9","children":["b35805d3-b6d1-44a5-a96b-f425d8c82c02"]},"b35805d3-b6d1-44a5-a96b-f425d8c82c02":{"id":"b35805d3-b6d1-44a5-a96b-f425d8c82c02","message":{"id":"b35805d3-b6d1-44a5-a96b-f425d8c82c02","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{}},"create_time":1761011233.0437815,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["You are nearing the maximum number of calls to this tool.

Retail investors' share of equity order flows rose significantly, and platforms like eToro saw massive user growth. Many retail traders began investing in stock options, amplifying price movements.\n\nThis newfound retail activity targeted struggling companies like GameStop, sparking a price surge of over 1600% that caught Wall Street off guard. Conversations on forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets played a major role in driving hype and coordination among these individual investors. Hedge funds like Melvin Capital, heavily shorting GameStop, suffered major losses as retail investors triggered a short squeeze, forcing institutional traders to buy back shares at inflated prices.\n\nWhile some investors profited, analysts warned of asset bubbles and the risks of speculative trading, especially with margin lending. If the market turned, retail investors heavily exposed to overvalued stocks or debt could face significant financial losses.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Harvard Business School Library"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn17search0\ue202turn17search2\ue202turn17search1\ue201","start_idx":4620,"end_idx":4668,"safe_urls":["https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/04/ecommerce-sales-surged-during-pandemic.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/strategy%20and%20corporate%20finance/our%20insights/how%20covid%2019%20has%20pushed%20companies%20over%20the%20technology%20tipping%20point%20and%20transformed%20business%20forever/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the%20technology%20tipping-point-final.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"COVID-19 digital transformation & technology","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1601856000.0,"snippet":"Oct 5, 2020 \u2014 A new survey finds that responses to COVID-19 have speeded the adoption of digital technologies by several years\u2014and that many of these changes ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the technology ...","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/strategy%20and%20corporate%20finance/our%20insights/how%20covid%2019%20has%20pushed%20companies%20over%20the%20technology%20tipping%20point%20and%20transformed%20business%20forever/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the%20technology%20tipping-point-final.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"1Years ahead of the average rate of adoption from 2017 to 2019.

The suit demands Google divest its digital ad control tools, while Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., argues the action would stifle innovation and harm small businesses.
