All these options generally meet basic requirements like **air-conditioning and proper tables/chairs**, providing a comfortable, conducive environment for about 12 students. For example, one local facility advertises fully air-conditioned rooms with Wi-Fi, whiteboards, and even drinking water and copier access included\u301019\u2020L95-L100\u3011. Community Clubs (CCs) in the vicinity (e.g. Paya Lebar Kovan CC) also offer spaces for classes or meetings \u2013 often bookable through the official OnePA system\u301010\u2020L221-L229\u3011 \u2013 and even feature free open-access study corners for residents\u30102\u2020L17-L20\u3011. Below is a detailed breakdown of typical rental rates in Kovan by hourly, daily, and monthly terms, along with how pricing scales with room size and venue type.\n\n## Hourly Rental Rates for Classrooms (~12 Pax)\n\n**Typical hourly rates** for a private classroom (around 10\u201315 seating capacity) in Kovan range roughly from **S$20 up to S$50 per hour**. The exact rate depends on the venue and amenities:\n\n- Dedicated **tuition centers or training spaces** in the area commonly charge about **S$25\u2013$30 per hour** for a standard classroom. For instance, one listing near Kovan/Serangoon offers a 10-seater classroom at **S$25/hour**, 14-seater at **S$27.50/hour**, and an 18-seater at **S$30/hour**\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011. This illustrates how rates rise with capacity (larger room = higher hourly cost). The table below shows this example:\n\n| Room Capacity (approx) | Hourly Rate (S$)             | Example Source                           |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| ~10 students           | $25 per hour                | Kovan/Serangoon training space\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011 |\n| ~14 students           | $27.50 per hour             | Same location as above\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011        |\n| ~18 students           | $30 per hour                | Same location as above\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011        |\n\n- Smaller private classrooms (8\u201310 pax) can sometimes be found at the lower end (**~S$15\u2013$20/hour**) if booked under special conditions. For example, some providers offer ad-hoc rentals *from* about **$15/hour** with a minimum 2-hour booking\u301032\u2020L290-L297\u3011, though such low rates are not the norm and often promotional or for longer-term commitments.\n\n- In contrast, **premium tuition centers** or those right next to Kovan\u2019s busiest spots may charge higher. A **Conducive classroom 3 minutes from Kovan MRT** (near Heartland Mall) was advertised at **S$50 per hour**\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011. This higher rate included extras like free Wi-Fi, copier use, and beverages for students\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011, highlighting that venues offering additional amenities (and with heavy foot-traffic location) command the upper end of the price range.\n\nDespite differences, **all hourly rentals typically include basic furnishings and air-con** by default. It\u2019s advisable to book for at least 2 hours in many cases (some venues enforce a 2-hour minimum). Overall, for ~12 students in Kovan, expect roughly **$25\u2013$35/hour at most venues**, with outliers up to ~$50 for prime locations or premium services\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011.\n\n## Daily Rental Rates (Full-Day or Half-Day)\n\nFor those needing a room for a whole day or an extended block of hours, many Kovan venues offer **half-day or full-day packages** at discounted rates compared to the hourly price. Typical **daily rental rates** (covering ~8\u201312 hours of use) fall in the range of **S$200 to S$300 per day** for a classroom that fits ~12 students:\n\n- One tuition center in the Kovan area lists a rate of **S$160 for a half-day (6 hours)** and **S$300 for a full day (12 hours)\u301019\u2020L76-L84\u3011**. This works out to roughly **$25/hour** or less when booking a full day, a slight discount versus purely hourly booking. These package rates include the fully equipped classroom (whiteboard, projector, etc.) for the duration.\n\n- Another listing offered a **flat S$200 rate for a full weekday\u2019s use\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011**. In that specific case, the time slot was 3pm\u201310pm (7 hours) for a weekday, indicating the venue\u2019s *\u201cdaily\u201d* rate was meant for after-school hours on weekdays. The effective rate there comes to about $28.5/hour, which is a discount from its $50/h ad-hoc price\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011. (It\u2019s possible that full-day on weekends or longer hours would cost more, but the listing emphasized weekdays.)\n\nIn summary, renting a Kovan classroom for an entire day typically costs a few hundred dollars. **Expect around $250\u00b1$50 for a full-day rental** in most cases, with some variation by venue. Half-day blocks (e.g. morning or afternoon) are usually priced a bit lower (e.g. ~$150\u2013$180). These bulk rates benefit those running workshops or back-to-back sessions in one day, and they usually still include all amenities (air-con, furniture, wifi) for the duration.\n\n## Monthly and Long-Term Rentals\n\nIf you need a classroom **regularly or exclusively over a month or more**, there are two main approaches: (1) long-term hourly slot arrangements with an existing center, or (2) renting an entire small unit to use as your own classroom. \n\n**1. Monthly Packages at Tuition Centers:** Many tuition centers allow instructors to rent a room recurring every week, or even to block out a room in the center every day, for a fixed monthly fee. This option is essentially a volume discount for frequent use:\n\n- For example, the Kovan MRT area listing mentioned earlier offers a rate of **S$3,600 per month** for using the classroom on all weekday evenings\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011. That covered weekdays 3pm\u201310pm, i.e. roughly 140 hours total in a month, which comes out to about **$25/hour** \u2013 half the ad-hoc hourly rate, reflecting a bulk discount for the long-term commitment.\n\n- Another anecdote from a local tutor indicates paying **about S$800 per month** for usage every weekend (4 hours each on Saturdays and Sundays)\u301032\u2020L232-L239\u3011. Over a month this provided ~32 hours of classroom time, also roughly **$25/hour**, in an established tuition center (inclusive of power and aircon)\u301032\u2020L232-L239\u3011. Deals like this are typically negotiated for off-peak times (e.g. weekends or specific days) and can bring costs down significantly.\n\nIn practice, **monthly shared-use packages** for a ~12-pax classroom in Kovan might range from around **S$3,000 to S$4,000** depending on how many hours per week you get. The more hours you commit to, the lower the effective hourly rate. Expect to negotiate specifics (exact times, included days) with the venue \u2013 and ensure your slot doesn\u2019t conflict with their own classes.\n\n**2. Renting a Full Unit (Private Premises):** If you require a classroom full-time or want complete control of the space, renting a small commercial unit in the Kovan area is an option. Kovan has HDB shophouse units and small commercial spaces near the MRT that can serve as private classrooms. The cost is higher in absolute terms but gives exclusive use 24/7:\n\n- A **300 sq ft shop space near Kovan** (roughly the size to fit 12\u201315 students) is listed around **S$5,000 per month in rent\u301021\u2020L11-L17\u3011**. For instance, one listing for a 208 Hougang St.21 unit (close to Kovan MRT) was asking **S$5,200/month for 300 sqft** and another similar unit at **S$5,000/month\u301021\u2020L11-L17\u3011**. This equates to roughly **S$16\u2013$17 per sq ft per month** in the Kovan locale. A 200\u2013250 sqft unit (which might seat ~10\u201312 students) would proportionally cost on the order of ~$4,000/month if priced similarly.\n\n- Besides rent, keep in mind operating a standalone unit incurs added costs (utilities, maintenance, etc.) but also grants full flexibility in scheduling and branding. Some education businesses opt for this if they run classes daily and can utilize the space enough to justify the cost. For comparison, the ~$5k monthly cost spread over full-time usage (say ~200+ hours/month potential) could net an effective cost of <$25/hour, **cheaper per hour** than short-term renting \u2013 but only if you actually need the room all the time. Otherwise, sharing a classroom (as in option 1) is more cost-effective.\n\nIn summary, a **long-term rental in a shared facility** might cost a few thousand dollars per month for a part-time schedule, whereas taking up a **whole small unit** in Kovan will be on the order of **S$5k+ per month** for full-time access\u301021\u2020L11-L17\u3011. The table below summarizes typical price ranges by rental duration, with examples:\n\n| Rental Duration            | Typical Price (Kovan, ~12-pax room)      | Examples / Notes                                                      |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Hourly** (ad-hoc)        | ~S$25 \u2013 S$50 per hour                    | $27.50/h for 14-pax room\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011; up to $50/h with amenities\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011. |\n| **Full-Day** (8\u201312 hours)  | ~S$200 \u2013 S$300 per day                   | $160 for 6-hr half-day, $300/12-hr full-day package\u301019\u2020L78-L84\u3011; one center charged ~$200 for a weekday (7h)\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011. |\n| **Monthly** (recurring slot) | ~S$3,000 \u2013 S$4,000 per month           | ~$3,600/month for weekday evenings (\u2248140h)\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011 (~$25/h). Another: ~$800/month for 8h every weekend\u301032\u2020L232-L239\u3011 (~$25/h). |\n| **Monthly** (dedicated unit) | ~S$4,500 \u2013 S$6,000+ per month          | Renting a 200\u2013300 sqft private unit. E.g. ~300 sqft at ~$5,000/month\u301021\u2020L11-L17\u3011 (exclusive use, 24/7 access). |\n\n## Community Center and Non-Private Venues\n\nIn addition to private commercial venues, **Community Centers** in the Kovan vicinity (such as *Paya Lebar Kovan CC*) provide another avenue for classroom space. These are public venues managed by the People\u2019s Association, often used for grassroots courses but sometimes available for private bookings:\n\n- **Facilities and Rates:** Community Clubs have air-conditioned *function rooms, multi-purpose rooms,* and *classrooms* that residents or organizations can rent. While the PA does not publicly list all the rates without login, such venues are generally **budget-friendly**. Anecdotally, small CC classrooms or meeting rooms can cost on the order of tens of dollars per hour (often with lower rates for community activities). One rental platform shows community spaces starting around *\u201cfrom S$50 per hour\u201d* in Singapore\u301048\u2020L99-L107\u3011, though actual prices depend on room size and whether you are a resident (members may get discounts). In Kovan\u2019s case, any available CC classroom would likely be priced competitively (perhaps in the ~$20\u2013$30/hour range for a 10-20 pax room), undercutting many private centers \u2013 albeit availability might be limited to certain hours.\n\n- **Booking Process:** To rent a CC venue, you typically must **book through the official OnePA system**\u301010\u2020L221-L229\u3011 (using a Singpass login for Singapore residents) and adhere to community use policies. This is a different process from simply calling a private landlord. Approval might depend on the nature of the use (educational uses are usually acceptable). The advantage is a reliable, clean space with basic amenities at a low cost; the trade-off is less flexibility (you might not get peak weekend slots if community events have priority). It\u2019s worth checking with Paya Lebar Kovan CC or nearby CCs for their function room availability if cost is a primary concern.\n\n- **Community Spaces (Free Study Areas):** It\u2019s also notable that beyond formal rentals, **many CCs and RCs offer free study corners** for students\u30102\u2020L17-L20\u3011. For example, over 270 community sites island-wide have air-conditioned study spaces open to the public\u30102\u2020L17-L20\u3011. In Kovan, one could utilize such spaces for group study sessions without charge. However, these are **shared spaces (not exclusively reserved)**, so they wouldn\u2019t be suitable for holding a private class session where you need a closed-door setting. For an actual class or tuition session, renting a room would be necessary for privacy and control.\n\n## Pricing Factors: Room Size and Location\n\nFrom the above data, we can see clear correlations between **room size, location, and price**:\n\n- **Room Size/Capacity:** Larger classrooms cost more to rent. The pricing often scales roughly with the number of seats. In the earlier example, a jump from a 10-seat room to an 18-seat room increased the rate from $25 to $30 per hour\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011. That suggests roughly **S$1\u2013$2 extra per additional student seat/hour** as a rule of thumb in this range. A room comfortable for 12 students (~200\u2013250 sq ft) tends to fall in the mid-20s to mid-30s per hour in Kovan. If you only need space for, say, 5\u20136 students, there are smaller rooms (some venues have tiny meeting rooms) that could come cheaper (some reports of ~$15\u2013$20/hour)\u301032\u2020L290-L297\u3011. Conversely, if you needed a room for 20 students, expect to pay closer to $30\u2013$50/hour depending on the venue.\n\n- **Location & Venue Type:** Even within Kovan, *where* the room is and what type of facility it is will affect the price. Classrooms located **very near Kovan MRT or in busy hubs** (e.g. adjacent to Heartland Mall, with heavy foot traffic) have shown higher prices \u2013 e.g. $50/hour in a prime spot\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011 \u2013 since convenience and visibility are valued. Meanwhile, venues that are in the *immediate region but not in the busiest mall* (for example, a 5-minute walk away, or near Serangoon MRT which is one stop away) charged closer to $25\u2013$30/hour\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011. In essence, you pay a premium to be right at the transport node or commercial center. Community centers, which are slightly off the commercial path and publicly subsidized, can offer lower rates as noted. Additionally, a **dedicated commercial venue vs. a side-gig classroom** can differ: a professional space rental company (or co-working space) might offer lower base prices because they focus on keeping the room booked, whereas a tuition centre renting out its spare room might set a higher price since that\u2019s not its core business (and it may include perks like coffee, etc.). \n\n- **Heartland vs. City**: It\u2019s worth noting that **Kovan is a heartland (suburban) area**, so its rental rates are moderate compared to downtown Singapore. Similar classrooms in central areas (Orchard, CBD) often charge more. For example, an education space in Orchard can run around $90/hour for a medium room\u301048\u2020L125-L133\u3011, far above Kovan levels. This means Kovan offers relatively good value for money for tuition room rentals, balancing accessibility (it\u2019s on the MRT line) with lower costs than city centre venues.\n\nIn conclusion, **a 12-student tuition room in Kovan typically costs** about **S$25\u2013$35/hour** on an as-needed basis, **~S$200\u2013$300 for a full day**, or **on the order of S$3k\u2013$4k per month** for regular use \u2013 with prices trending higher for bigger rooms and ultra-convenient locations. Community venues can provide budget options (with some trade-offs in flexibility), while renting an entire small unit is the priciest route but offers full control. These figures are drawn from current local listings, official platforms, and rental market data in 2024\u20132025, ensuring an up-to-date reflection of Kovan\u2019s rental landscape\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Local classroom rental listings near Kovan (GetSpaces, Carousell)\u30101\u2020L124-L132\u3011\u301041\u2020L1-L3\u3011  \n- Tuition centre rental packages (Math Coffee \u2013 Kovan area)\u301019\u2020L78-L84\u3011\u301019\u2020L95-L100\u3011  \n- Community Center information (People\u2019s Association OnePA)\u301010\u2020L221-L229\u3011\u30102\u2020L17-L20\u3011  \n- Commercial property listings in Kovan for size/pricing reference\u301021\u2020L11-L17\u3011  \n- Forum discussions from educators on rental costs in Singapore\u301032\u2020L232-L239\u3011\u301032\u2020L290-L297\u3011"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":611,"end_ix":624,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Rent Fully-Equipped Classrooms in Singapore | Math Coffee","url":"https://www.mathcoffee.com.sg/class-for-rent#:~:text=%2A%20%23%23%23%20Air,Use%2C%20at%20very%20low%20cost","text":"* ### Air-conditioned environment for comfort.

do a precise, critical analysis based on everything you've given:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Assessment of the Space (Based on Photos)**\n\n- **Capacity:**  \n  - Room setup supports around **12 students comfortably** (2 students per desk, 6 desks).\n- **Condition:**  \n  - **Very clean**, **bright**, freshly painted white walls.\n  - Proper air-conditioning (wall-mounted split unit) visible.\n  - Modern flooring (vinyl/laminate wood) \u2014 warm tone, contributes to a comfortable atmosphere.\n- **Amenities visible:**  \n  - Digital wall clock.\n  - Large wall-mounted smart screen (likely touch-enabled).\n  - Access to pantry area with snacks, water dispenser, small seating.\n  - Tables and chairs are proper tuition-grade \u2014 individual plastic chairs (easy maintenance) and double-student-width tables.\n- **Environment:**  \n  - **Professional and minimalist**, good for academic work, with minor touches of casual comfort (snack area).\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a *very decent* tuition-grade room, better than many low-end setups. The smart TV and pantry upgrade it slightly above bare minimum tuition room offerings.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Price Benchmark Based on Kovan Area (and Block Booking Discount)**\n\n### Referencing the findings earlier:\n| Benchmark Context             | Price Range (Hourly) | Notes |\n|:------------------------------|:--------------------|:-----|\n| Standard classroom (~10-14 pax) | **$25\u2013$30/hour**      | Without extras like pantry.
