I particularly like the little red dot in the ThinkChina logo, which has a special significance.\r\n\r\nAs I said then, ThinkChina is an insider, but with an outsider\u2019s perspective on China. This is of great value to those unfamiliar with the Chinese language, but who are nonetheless deeply interested in developments in China.\r\n\r\nThe question of today\u2019s forum is: China\u2019s future in this changing world. And this is an important question.\r\n\r\nChina is large and complex. And there is also now a great deal of uncertainty in global affairs. So it is unlikely that we can arrive at any definitive answers. Much depends on the choices that China, and other major actors, make. What we can do, however, is to establish a conceptual framework, a structure of thinking, to help us think about this question, and to put the events that we observe in context.\r\nBeyond the End of History\r\nChina's opening up and the unipolar moment that arose at the end of the cold war resulted in a period of remarkable growth for China. In the short span of just four decades, China lifted 800 million of its citizens out of poverty. Its tier one cities are now among the most dynamic and prosperous in the world.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of China\u2019s growth went far beyond its borders. China\u2019s economic expansion has been a major engine of global growth. And as the factory of the world, China brought cheaper goods into the homes and workplaces of people everywhere.\r\n\r\nChina is now in a more mature phase of growth. This has its attendant challenges. But we have also gone beyond the supposed \u201cend of history\u201d, and so China now finds itself facing a much more complex external environment.\r\n\r\nTo make sense of this, we can examine the internal and external driving forces that China must contend with; the policy choices that China will face domestically; and on the international front, how China and the rest of the world\u2019s decisions and actions interact with each other.\r\nInternal Factors\r\nDomestically, China faces structural challenges, and these challenges are not unique to China. They arise whenever countries transition from developing to developed status. But what China faces is more acute than most because of the rapid pace and the scale of its development.\r\n\r\nOne major factor is demographics. China\u2019s population peaked and began falling in 2022. India\u2019s population has now overtaken China\u2019s. China\u2019s workforce has been shrinking since 2015. Unlike other Asian countries which still have younger populations like India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, this phase of China\u2019s demographic dividend has passed.\r\n\r\nThings are just as challenging on the other side of the dependency equation.\r\n\r\nChina is ageing faster than almost all other countries in modern history. More than 20 million workers will retire each year over the next decade. By 2040, almost 30% of the population will be 60 or older. Concerns surrounding retirement \u2013 retirement adequacy, demand for healthcare, and other social pressures \u2013 from a fast-ageing population will inevitably grow.\r\n\r\nA second factor is rising expectations. A more prosperous society invariably has more complex and varied demands. As an example, it is hard to expect that older Chinese will be satisfied with medical treatment from the \u201cbarefoot doctors\u201d they experienced in their youth, and certainly the younger generations of Chinese expect much more from their healthcare providers.\r\n\r\nThere is also the specific challenge of providing employment for a workforce with a much greater proportion of university graduates. Last year, China produced a record 11.8 million graduates, double what it was just a decade and a half ago \u2013 many of them in STEM subjects. A more educated population represents a great deal of potential, but it can become a headache if expectations about jobs, economic opportunities and quality of life are not met. I remember having a discussion with Chinese Vice Premier Mr Li Lanqing, who was responsible at that time for expanding the education opportunities and the percentage of Chinese students going for higher education. He said this is what they want. So I said this certainly will bring benefit to China, but you must be careful that it may not make them happier. That is a different matter altogether.\r\n\r\nSo this brings us to China\u2019s first set of choices.\r\n\r\nOn domestic matters, China is best placed to choose the strategies it believes will help drive the high-quality economic growth it desires, and maintain the compact between the people and their government. It has tackled corruption, including in high places, and inflation is manageable.\r\n\r\nThe PRC government has identified various areas in need of domestic policy reform, and is actively working on them. These include: (i) a plan to raise retirement ages over the next 15 years; (ii) greater efforts to develop the silver economy; (iii) reorienting economic activity to increase domestic consumption; (iv) increasing productivity and reducing the need for labour through automation, robotics and AI; and (v) measures to improve the sustainability of local government finances and to stabilise the property market.\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s success in overcoming even larger challenges over the past forty years of reform and opening up provides optimism that it will succeed in this endeavour. These are not small challenges. Ultimately, a stable, growing, and prosperous China has significant spillover benefits for our region, and for the world.\r\n\r\nExternal Factors\r\nSo let us now look beyond China\u2019s borders.\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s rise has dramatically altered the nature of its external relations.\r\n\r\nCompared to almost a quarter century ago when China joined the WTO as a developing economy, China is now a large and technologically advanced economy, and a large trading and export economy.\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s military power has also grown. Let me provide some perspective on this. There are five permanent members in the UN Security Council. US defence expenditure at around USD 800, 900 billion a year, is larger than the other four UN Security Council permanent members together. But excluding the US, China\u2019s defence expenditure at about USD 250 billion is about equal to the other three permanent members combined \u2013 even given that Russia has tripled its defence expenditure since the start of the Ukraine War.\r\n\r\nChina is now top in several technology areas. It has cornered the market in green tech. And based on the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s Critical Technology Tracker, China is the leader in scientific and research innovation in 57 out of 64 critical technologies. This is a stunning development from just two decades ago, when the US led in 60 out of 64 critical technologies.\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s standing up \uff08\u7ad9\u8d77\u6765\uff09, becoming rich \uff08\u798f\u8d77\u6765\uff09, and now aspiration to become strong \uff08\u5f3a\u8d77\u6765\uff09, is understandable. But China must expect other countries to react and respond to these changes.\r\n\r\nMost countries no longer consider China a developing country. This shapes their expectations for their dealings with China, in particular in their trading relations with China, and for China to step up and play a greater role in addressing global issues.\r\n\r\nIt is in this context that China faces a second set of choices, which pertain to its relations with other countries and the international community as a whole. These include: (i) trade policy; (ii) intellectual property policy; (iii) industrial policy for technology development, production, and export; (iv) how China manages its relations with the countries along its borders, in particular territorial disputes involving overlapping claims; and (v) how it employs both hard and soft power to influence global security and economic affairs, and to maintain access to resources and markets.\r\n\r\nUS-China Relations\r\nChina\u2019s approach to these foreign policy questions will affect its relations with other countries, and most consequentially with the US.\r\n\r\nOverall, however, the fundamental question for China, and for its dance partner, the US, is: What kind of world do we aspire to? One where one country seeks primacy, even dominance, over all others, out of a desire to be able to set the rules to its own advantage, or out of fear of being dominated by others. Such an approach is inherently zero-sum.\r\n\r\nPresident Xi Jinping wrote in his congratulatory message to President Trump on the latter\u2019s re-election: \u201cHistory tells us that both countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation\u201d.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the benefits from a collaborative approach is a good start point. But for both sides to act in accordance with it is quite another. A country can demonstrate strength through confrontation, or it can choose to demonstrate strength and self-confidence through cooperation. For now, unfortunately, both sides seem to be demonstrating strength through confrontation rather than cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe implications of this choice \u2013 to be dance partners or battling gladiators \u2013 are seismic.\r\n\r\nBetween the US and China, there are effectively three categories of issues. First, those that can lead to major conflict, dark red lines, like Taiwan. Second, issues where there are differences, even deep differences but ought not to, on their own, lead to conflict. Trade imbalances, protectionist policies, drugs, and intellectual property protection. They can be negotiated. Third, the issues of the global commons, such as climate change and pandemics, where cooperation is needed and inherently win-win.\r\n\r\nBoth sides have declared that they do not seek nor want war with the other. If that is the case, then both sides should work to manage that first set of issues. This would provide the foundation to constructively address the second set of issues, and to cooperate on the third.\r\n\r\nBut if one side or the other, or both, believe that confrontation and conflict is inevitable, then the second and third set of issues are merely bargaining chips to be accumulated in preparation for a conflict.\r\n\r\nImplications for Smaller Countries\r\nSo what does this mean for the rest of us, particularly in our part of the world?\r\n\r\nWe must expect that each country big or small, will want to advance its national self-interest. However, we should differentiate between narrow, and often short-term self-interest, as compared to wider, enlightened, and longer-term self-interest.\r\n\r\nEngagement on a mutually respectful and beneficial basis is more likely to be productive and successful, and lead to long-term partnerships, and not just short-term advantage.\r\n\r\nThe major countries should therefore engage with each of the countries in Southeast Asia, and our region as a whole, on our own merits, and not merely through the lens of the competition between themselves, the bigger countries.\r\n\r\nAs small countries, we cannot dictate what big powers choose to do, but on our part, as smaller countries we do have agency.\r\n\r\nSingapore has good relations, including FTAs, with the US and the China. We also partner like-minded countries, and have built a wide network of FTAs, including with the Gulf Cooperation Council, the EU, UK, Mercosur, India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nThe current global uncertainties have provided added motivation for countries to tie up with each other. India is one country that can potentially benefit from this, as it is being sought out as a partner variously by the UK, the EU, the GCC, and New Zealand, among others.\r\n\r\nAs a region, we can strengthen our own unity and resilience. Both nationally, and as ASEAN. This will enhance our ability to respond, whichever world we end up in.\r\n\r\nWe should also continue to grow linkages and partnerships that include the US, China, both, and neither, so long as they have an open orientation and welcome economies which subscribe to the same principles, and are prepared to abide by the same rules. So if you look at the combination of IPEF, RCEP, APEC, and the CPTPP \u2013 these are just four examples - respectively, they include the US, China, both, and neither. The CPTPP in particular welcomed the UK as its first non-original member at the end of last year, extending its geographical reach beyond the \u201cTrans-Pacific\u201d.\r\n\r\nThese bilateral, multi-lateral, and mini-lateral relationships are building blocks that can provide an environment where trade and investment continues to flow relatively smoothly.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWhat is the larger context? What is the larger picture? Forty years ago, in October 1985, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, then Prime Minister of Singapore, had the honour of addressing the Joint US Houses of Congress. He reflected upon the forty years since the end of the Second World War, and what kind of world we might see in the 21st Century.\r\n\r\nMr Lee said, and I quote, \u201c\u2026 There are two scenarios for the 21st Century\u2026 For 40 years the maintenance of political boundaries was made possible because thrusting, and usually aggressive, peoples have been able to fulfil their drive to better their lot through trade. If this method for adjustment and accommodation between societies moving at different speeds is no longer possible, then a return to the traditional ways of conquest or influence is likely.\u201d End quote.\r\n\r\nAnother forty years have passed since 1985, and we are now living in the 21st Century. And these reflections remain valid today, and are relevant to the decisions that we take in each of our own countries.\r\n\r\nWe all aspire to a peaceful and prosperous world, and better lives for our peoples. The path we take is in our hands.\r\n\r\nA deeper understanding of US-China relations for both sides, and for the rest of us affected by it is crucial.\r\n\r\nAnd Singapore is therefore glad to serve as a meeting point for those in Asia and beyond, to exchange opinions and gain new perspectives on these crucial issues.\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s ThinkChina Forum adds another platform for such exchange, and complements the body of perspectives offered by the more than 500 authors in ThinkChina\u2019s stable of contributors.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the panel and hearing your perspectives.

Purpose and Framing**\n- **Forum Theme:** *\u201cChina\u2019s future in a changing world\u201d* \u2013 a complex and uncertain subject.\n- **Approach:** Rather than offering definitive answers, he advocates for a **conceptual framework** to analyze China\u2019s trajectory amid internal and external forces.\n\n---\n\n## **2. China's Internal Challenges and Strategic Choices**\n### **Demographic Headwinds**\n- Population peaked in 2022; workforce shrinking since 2015.\n- Rapid ageing: 20 million retirees annually over the next decade; nearly 30% will be 60+ by 2040.\n  \n### **Rising Expectations**\n- Growing demands for higher standards in public services (e.g. healthcare).\n- Employment challenge: Record 11.8 million graduates in 2024 (many in STEM); economic opportunity must match educational advancement.\n\n### **Policy Responses**\nChina is pursuing multiple internal reforms:\n- Raising retirement age over 15 years.\n- Developing the \"silver economy.\"\n- Boosting domestic consumption.\n- Enhancing productivity through AI, robotics, and automation.\n- Stabilizing local government finances and the property sector.\n\n> *Key Point:* Despite the scale of these challenges, China\u2019s reform track record gives grounds for **cautious optimism**.\n\n---\n\n## **3. China's External Posture and Responsibilities**\n### **Transformation in Global Standing**\n- From WTO accession (developing country) to a top-tier economy and technology leader.\n- Defence spending: ~$250B, on par with other non-US UNSC members combined.\n- Dominant in 57 of 64 critical technologies (per ASPI), especially in green tech.\n\n### **Foreign Policy and Global Role**\nChina must make choices in:\n- Trade and IP policy.\n- Industrial/tech development.\n- Border relations and territorial disputes.\n- Deployment of hard and soft power.\n\n> *Key Point:* China\u2019s aspirations (\u201cstand up, get rich, become strong\u201d) are understandable\u2014but **provoke global recalibration**, requiring diplomatic finesse and responsibility.\n\n---\n\n## **4. US-China Relations: A Critical Axis**\n### **Current Dynamics**\n- Increasingly confrontational, despite mutual declarations against war.\n- China and US face **three classes of issues**:\n  1. *Red lines:* Risk of conflict (e.g. Taiwan).\n  2. *Negotiable issues:* Trade, IP, drugs, etc.\n  3. *Global commons:* Climate change, pandemics \u2013 inherently win-win.\n\n> *Key Point:* Whether they act as **partners or adversaries** will shape the global order profoundly.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Implications for Smaller States and the ASEAN Region**\n### **Agency and Strategy**\n- Small countries cannot dictate major power moves but **retain agency** in shaping outcomes.\n- Singapore maintains strong ties with both US and China, and has **diversified partnerships** via FTAs (e.g., with EU, GCC, Mercosur).\n\n### **Strategic Multilateralism**\n- Regional frameworks like **RCEP, CPTPP, IPEF, APEC** are key platforms that involve US, China, both, or neither \u2013 providing strategic flexibility.\n\n> *Key Point:* ASEAN should emphasize **unity, resilience, and open partnerships** to navigate geopolitical shifts.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Concluding Reflection**\n- Quoting Lee Kuan Yew (1985): If trade no longer serves as a mechanism for global adjustment, nations may return to older modes of **conquest or dominance**.\n- The **path forward is in our hands**\u2014with peace and prosperity as shared aspirations, contingent on **deep understanding** and **constructive engagement**, particularly between the US and China.\n\n---\n\n## **Meta-Message**\n- **Singapore\u2019s role**: A neutral meeting ground and intellectual hub (e.g., ThinkChina) to facilitate dialogue and foster nuanced understanding of China and broader global dynamics.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a visual mind map, slide deck-style summary, or a tailored version for a specific audience (e.g. policymakers, educators, business leaders)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"cd410423-acc7-4a51-a87f-10932e6c1888","request_id":"927ad2a92a57fd9e-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cd410423-acc7-4a51-a87f-10932e6c1888","children":[]}}}
