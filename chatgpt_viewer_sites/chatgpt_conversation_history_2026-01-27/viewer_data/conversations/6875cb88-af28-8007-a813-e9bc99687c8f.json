The impact caused a series of catastrophic events, including massive fires, tsunamis, and a global \"impact winter\" blocking sunlight, leading to a collapse in food chains and the extinction of about 75% of all species, including dinosaurs. This event, known as the KT extinction, left a distinct geological marker, the KT boundary layer. Recently, Robert DePalma discovered a remarkable site in North Dakota's Hell Creek Formation, dubbed Tanis, which appears to capture those moments vividly. The site contains a treasure trove of well-preserved fossils and impact debris, providing a detailed record of the catastrophic day. This discovery has the potential to clarify many aspects of the KT extinction, including the immediate effects on Earth's biosphere and the last moments of the dinosaurs.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1553850000.0,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6875cbddd6b08007ac6cd3d1de412ec1","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"95f631361dbc86fb-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"8291bd0e-35ea-4d27-9db0-86b15b9f32cd","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8291bd0e-35ea-4d27-9db0-86b15b9f32cd","children":["2434985f-c912-450a-9ad8-fcd1c148208d"]},"2434985f-c912-450a-9ad8-fcd1c148208d":{"id":"2434985f-c912-450a-9ad8-fcd1c148208d","message":{"id":"2434985f-c912-450a-9ad8-fcd1c148208d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752550407.538324,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into crocodilian lineage","content":"I have information that crocodilians date back about 200 million years, but I wonder about the modern lineages and how much they've changed during that time.

They offer fascinating examples of evolutionary conservatism **and** stark reminders that culinary demand can swiftly endanger even the most time\u2011tested survivors of Earth\u2019s deep past."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":790,"end_idx":810,"safe_urls":["https://australian.museum/about/organisation/media-centre/age-of-monotremes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Australian Museum](https://australian.museum/about/organisation/media-centre/age-of-monotremes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Australian scientists identify 'Age of Monotremes'","url":"https://australian.museum/about/organisation/media-centre/age-of-monotremes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1716768000.0,"snippet":"The research reveals that 100 million years ago, Australia was home to a diversity of monotremes, of which the platypus and the echidna are the only surviving ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Australian Museum"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search3\ue201","start_idx":926,"end_idx":958,"safe_urls":["https://brunyfirepower.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/hunting-the-elusive-piggiebillah/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.aboriginalculture.com.au/bush-foods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([aboriginalculture.com.au](https://www.aboriginalculture.com.au/bush-foods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [brunyfire](https://brunyfirepower.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/hunting-the-elusive-piggiebillah/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Traditional Aboriginal Bush Foods","url":"https://www.aboriginalculture.com.au/bush-foods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"All land animals are eaten, including kangaroos, wallabies, koalas (in the past), possums, bandicoots, native rats and mice, echidnas, snakes and lizards.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"aboriginalculture.com.au"},{"title":"Hunting the Elusive Piggiebillah. - brunyfire - WordPress.com","url":"https://brunyfirepower.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/hunting-the-elusive-piggiebillah/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1328572800.0,"snippet":"But echidna's were certainly on the menu for the early settlers in Australia and are still a favourite treat for local indigenous Aborigines on ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"brunyfire"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":1080,"end_idx":1099,"safe_urls":["https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250614034233.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250614034233.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Africa's pangolin crisis: The delicacy that's driving a species to the ...","url":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250614034233.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749859200.0,"snippet":"\"If we lose the pangolin, we lose 80 million years of evolution,\" said Emogor. \"Pangolins are the only mammals with scales, and their ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"ScienceDaily"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201","start_idx":1224,"end_idx":1256,"safe_urls":["https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/pangolins-hunted-food-west-africa?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250614034233.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/pangolins-hunted-food-west-africa?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250614034233.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Pangolins in West Africa hunted for food rather than for illicit scales ...","url":"https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/pangolins-hunted-food-west-africa?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749772800.0,"snippet":"Pangolins in West Africa hunted for food rather than for illicit scales trade.
