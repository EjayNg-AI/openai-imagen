In fact, intense scrutiny has been placed on  Parliamentary opposition in Singapore, for instance the AHPETC saga and COI into Raeesah Khan's conduct. Furthermore, I personally have little faith in the press at holding public servants to scrutiny. The press is populist, serves the whims of the masses, and appeals to the lowest common denominator.\r\n\r\nPlease organize my above opinions into a more articulate and nuanced response\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT LKY SAW, AND DIDN'T\r\n\r\nThe Nassim Jade controversy of 1996 is interesting to revisit not only because it, too, starred a certain Ong Beng Seng, but also because it happened during a transformational period in PAP governance.\r\n\r\nStarting out leftist, the PAP had very quickly acknowledged the need to ride the waves of global capitalism, courting multinationals with a vengeance. Culturally, however, the PAP leaders remained austere, and suspicious of local business elites. \r\n\r\nBy the 1990s, Lee realised that the government\u2019s ambitions to develop an external wing to the Singapore economy required consorting with these capitalists. He acknowledged that this rubbed against the PAP grain. He told Parliament during the Nassim Jade debate: \r\n\r\n\u201cOur problem now is we are going regional in a big way. So I have had Ministers telling me, \u2018Better don't meet these people.\u2019 I have never met these people before. But to go regional, I have met Ng Teng Fong, I have met the Kwek brothers, Kwek Leng Joo, I have met Ong Beng Seng.\"\r\n\r\nHe added: \u201cDr Aline Wong [then a Senior Minister of State] is very wise, she told my brother, Dr Lee Suan Yew, who told me recently, this is all very dangerous, giving these people face and stature in Singapore. My being seen with them. But there is no way. How can I help them go regional into China or Vietnam, unless I know how they operate, what are their problems, what can I do to clear these road blocks? I have met them privately in my office to discuss these problems.\u201d\r\n\r\nLee shared his immediate reaction when he first realised that Ong\u2019s company had given him a 7% discount and his son Lee Hsien Loong a 12% discount for their property purchases. \u201c[M]y first thought was: \u2018This man, Ong Beng Seng, is a dangerous fellow. He is investing in the young man and not investing in the old!\u2019\u201d Lee, I think, was wryly noting that Ong seemed to be grooming the younger Lee. \u201cSo I told him, when I saw him on Thursday evening, \u2018Look, don't fool around. I look at it, I think you are up to no good. You say you are not up to no good, you explain.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nLee\u2019s speech shows him to have been extremely conscious of the risks of what economists call state capture by corporate titans. His response was classic LKY \u2014 put faith in internal discipline, guided by the ethos of good men. \u201cI can eat with Ong Beng Seng and Koh Beng Seng and I would still be the same person. No difference. And that is again back to character and a code of honour.\u201d\r\n\r\nI think any political scientist today, and historians of Singapore politics in the future, will recognise the great flaw in his strategy. By relying more on internal checks by good men than external scrutiny by a fearless press, parliamentary opposition and civil society, LKY was brushing aside key institutions we know are required to build and preserve a system with integrity. \r\n\r\nIn theory, we could and should have both: robust internal and external checks. In practice, however, the PAP has insisted that good men with the right ethos will only come forward if society and the press go easy on them. This is one of the PAP's rationalisations for the suppression of freedom of expression. \r\nThere is truth to the observation that a toxic political environment will deter good people from coming forward. But a system designed to protect good rulers from the rabble also gives imperfect men a sense of impunity and delays the timely exposure of questionable conduct. Citizens will have to decide which, in today's Singapore, poses the bigger risk."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8cd9ef79ee6fce06-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f665d6a7-3e26-481c-b7f6-32735ead7cca","children":["724929ec-1c9f-45c7-8461-6c02d19921c9"]},"724929ec-1c9f-45c7-8461-6c02d19921c9":{"id":"724929ec-1c9f-45c7-8461-6c02d19921c9","message":{"id":"724929ec-1c9f-45c7-8461-6c02d19921c9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1728094869.487828,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa28642-585d-492d-a5b9-bbe76ef5f2da","request_id":"8cd9ef79ee6fce06-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa28642-585d-492d-a5b9-bbe76ef5f2da","children":["a028c290-20de-4105-bec1-027a17aa8fe1"]},"a028c290-20de-4105-bec1-027a17aa8fe1":{"id":"a028c290-20de-4105-bec1-027a17aa8fe1","message":{"id":"a028c290-20de-4105-bec1-027a17aa8fe1","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1728094869.487973,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Your response could be structured as follows to reflect a more articulate and nuanced perspective:\n\n---\n\nWhile Cherian George argues that Lee Kuan Yew (LKY) placed too much faith in internal checks by \"good men\" at the expense of external scrutiny by the press, parliamentary opposition, and civil society, I find myself skeptical of the role that these institutions have played, particularly in Singapore\u2019s context.
