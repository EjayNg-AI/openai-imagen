As video content continues to dominate online platforms, the need for accurate and efficient transcription services has skyrocketed. These tools not only enhance accessibility but also unlock a wealth of opportunities for content repurposing and SEO optimization.\n\nFrom AI-powered automatic transcription to user-friendly interfaces, the latest free YouTube transcription tools offer a range of features to suit various needs. Whether you're a small business owner looking to improve your video marketing strategy or a student seeking to extract valuable information from educational content, these tools can significantly streamline your workflow. As we delve into the top 10 free YouTube transcription tools of 2024, we'll explore their unique features, accuracy levels, and user experiences to help you find the perfect solution for your transcription needs.\n\n## Exploring the Need for Free YouTube Transcription Tools \n\nIn today's digital age, content creators and businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of transcribing YouTube videos. Accurate transcriptions not only improve accessibility but also boost SEO and content repurposing efforts. However, professional transcription services can be costly, especially for those working with tight budgets or handling large volumes of content.\n\nThis is where free YouTube transcription tools come into play, offering a cost-effective solution for content creators, marketers, and researchers alike. These tools utilize advanced speech recognition technology to convert spoken words into written text, often with impressive accuracy. While they may not match the precision of human transcriptionists, they provide a valuable starting point for those looking to make their video content more accessible and searchable without breaking the bank.\n\n### The Growing Popularity of Video Content \n\nVideo content has exploded in popularity, transforming how we consume information and entertainment online. YouTube, as the world's largest video-sharing platform, has become a hub for creators, businesses, and individuals to share their messages with a global audience. However, the audio-centric nature of videos can pose accessibility challenges and limit content repurposing opportunities.\n\nThis is where YouTube transcription tools come into play, offering a solution to convert spoken words into written text. These tools not only enhance accessibility for viewers with hearing impairments but also enable content creators to repurpose their videos into blog posts, social media snippets, and other text-based formats. As the demand for such tools grows, numerous free options have emerged, making it easier than ever for users to transcribe their YouTube videos without breaking the bank.\n\n### Accessibility and SEO Benefits \n\nTranscribing YouTube videos offers significant advantages for both accessibility and search engine optimization. By providing text versions of audio content, creators can make their videos more inclusive for deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers. This accessibility boost also extends to non-native speakers who may prefer reading subtitles in their language.\n\nFrom an SEO perspective, transcriptions unlock a wealth of indexable content for search engines. YouTube's automatic captions are often inaccurate, but free transcription tools can help creators generate high-quality text that accurately represents their video content. This text-based information allows search engines to better understand and rank the video, potentially increasing its visibility in search results. Additionally, transcripts enable viewers to quickly scan for specific information within a video, enhancing user experience and potentially increasing watch time and engagement.\n\n# Top 10 Free YouTube Transcription Tools in 2024 \n\nIn the digital age, content creators are constantly seeking efficient ways to enhance their YouTube videos. Transcription tools have become indispensable for improving accessibility, boosting SEO, and repurposing content. As we step into 2024, a plethora of free YouTube transcription tools have emerged, each offering unique features to streamline the process.\n\nFrom AI-powered solutions to user-friendly interfaces, these tools cater to various needs and skill levels. Whether you're a seasoned YouTuber or just starting out, finding the right transcription tool can significantly impact your workflow and audience engagement. Let's explore the top 10 free YouTube transcription tools that are making waves in 2024, helping creators unlock the full potential of their video content without breaking the bank.\n\n## Overview of the Top Tools \n\nIn the realm of YouTube content creation, transcription tools have become indispensable assets. These free utilities offer creators the ability to convert spoken words into text, enhancing accessibility and SEO potential. While numerous options exist, a select few stand out for their user-friendly interfaces and robust features.\n\nLeading the pack are tools that seamlessly integrate with YouTube's platform, allowing for direct transcription of uploaded videos. Others excel in accuracy, employing advanced speech recognition algorithms to ensure precise results. Some tools go beyond basic transcription, offering features like timestamp synchronization and multi-language support. As creators seek efficiency and quality, these top-tier free transcription tools continue to evolve, meeting the diverse needs of the YouTube community.\n\n### Key Features and Functionalities \n\nThe core features of free YouTube transcription tools revolve around two main areas: projects and library. These functionalities mirror real-life workflow, making it easier for users to organize and analyze their content effectively. The projects section allows users to cluster different documents into folders, simulating the structure of client projects. This organization method helps maintain a clear overview of various transcription tasks and their associated materials.\n\nOn the other hand, the library serves as a centralized hub for all transcribed calls and videos. After importing a YouTube video or call recording, users can access, review, and analyze the transcriptions within this section. The library's intuitive interface enables quick navigation through multiple transcripts, making it simple to locate specific content or compare different recordings. By combining these key features, free YouTube transcription tools offer a streamlined approach to managing and utilizing transcribed content, enhancing productivity for content creators, researchers, and professionals alike.\n\n### Usability and Interface \n\nWhen evaluating free YouTube transcription tools, usability and interface play crucial roles in determining their effectiveness. A well-designed interface can significantly enhance the user experience, making the transcription process smoother and more efficient. Many tools offer intuitive dashboards that allow users to easily upload videos, select language options, and customize output formats.\n\nThe best free YouTube transcription tools prioritize user-friendly interfaces with clear navigation and straightforward controls. They often feature drag-and-drop functionality for video uploads, progress indicators for ongoing transcriptions, and easy-to-use editing tools for refining the generated text. Some advanced tools even provide real-time previews of transcriptions as they're being processed, allowing users to quickly assess accuracy and make necessary adjustments. By focusing on usability, these tools cater to both novice users and experienced content creators, ensuring that anyone can easily transcribe their YouTube videos without technical hurdles.\n\n## In-Depth Look at Select Free YouTube Transcription Tools \n\nWhen it comes to free YouTube transcription tools, several options stand out for their user-friendly interfaces and efficient performance. These tools cater to content creators, researchers, and anyone needing accurate transcripts without breaking the bank.\n\nOne popular choice is YouTube's built-in auto-generated captions, which provide a quick and easy starting point for transcription. While not perfect, they offer a solid foundation that users can edit for improved accuracy. Another noteworthy option is Otter.ai, which uses advanced AI to transcribe videos with impressive precision. It offers a free tier with limited monthly minutes, making it accessible for occasional use. For those seeking more robust features, tools like Sonix and Trint offer free trials, allowing users to experience their advanced transcription capabilities before committing to a paid plan. These options demonstrate the diverse range of free YouTube transcription tools available, each with its own strengths and limitations.\n\n### Tool 1: Comprehensive Features and User Experience \n\nThe tool showcased in the context stands out for its user-friendly design and comprehensive functionality. Unlike many competitors that require extensive training or expertise, this platform is built with simplicity in mind. Users can dive straight into their core tasks without the need for instructional videos or complex onboarding processes.\n\nAt its core, the tool offers two primary workflows: video transcription and transcript analysis. The transcription feature allows users to process videos individually or in bulk, catering to various project sizes. For those who already have transcripts, the analysis function provides valuable insights. This dual approach makes the tool versatile, accommodating different user needs within a single, intuitive interface. The emphasis on ease of use, combined with powerful features, positions this tool as a standout option in the realm of video transcription and analysis.\n\n### Tool 2: Unique Selling Points and Limitations \n\nCustom Insights stands out as a unique feature, allowing users to tailor their analysis to specific needs. By default, the tool extracts pain points, desires, and behaviors, but users can customize it to focus on particular insights like risks or challenges. This flexibility enables targeted analysis, saving time and improving efficiency.\n\nOne limitation is the tool's reliance on accurate transcription. While it automatically tags and extracts insights, the quality of these insights depends on the transcript's accuracy. Additionally, the feature that allows users to ask questions directly from the transcript view is powerful but may require some learning to use effectively. Despite these minor drawbacks, Custom Insights offers a valuable way to gain context and extract meaningful information from YouTube transcriptions.\n\n# How to Choose the Right Tool for Your Needs \n\nWhen selecting a YouTube transcription tool, it's crucial to consider your specific needs and workflow. Some tools excel at speed, while others prioritize accuracy or offer advanced editing features. Begin by assessing the volume of videos you need to transcribe and how quickly you require results.\n\nFor occasional use, a simple online converter might suffice. However, if you're handling multiple videos regularly, look for tools with batch processing capabilities. Consider the languages you work with, as some free tools may have limitations in this area. Additionally, evaluate the output formats offered \u2013 do you need plain text, time-stamped transcripts, or subtitle files? Lastly, don't overlook user-friendliness. A tool that's intuitive and doesn't require extensive training can save you valuable time and frustration in the long run.\n\n## Factors to Consider When Selecting Free YouTube Transcription Tools \n\nWhen selecting free YouTube transcription tools, several crucial factors come into play. Accuracy is paramount; a tool's ability to correctly transcribe spoken words can make or break its usefulness. User-friendliness is another key consideration, as intuitive interfaces save time and reduce frustration.\n\nThe speed of transcription and the ability to handle various accents and languages are also important aspects to evaluate. Additionally, consider whether the tool offers features like speaker identification, timestamp generation, or integration with other platforms. Some free tools may have limitations on video length or the number of transcriptions per month, so assess your needs accordingly. Lastly, examine the tool's privacy policy and data handling practices to ensure your content remains secure and confidential.\n\n### Accuracy and Reliability \n\nAccuracy and reliability are paramount when it comes to free YouTube transcription tools. While these tools offer convenience and cost-effectiveness, users must consider their precision in converting speech to text. The quality of transcriptions can vary significantly among different platforms, affecting their usefulness for various purposes.\n\nMany free transcription tools utilize automated speech recognition (ASR) technology, which has improved dramatically in recent years. However, factors like accents, background noise, and technical jargon can still pose challenges. Some tools offer higher accuracy rates for certain languages or dialects, making it crucial to choose one that aligns with your specific needs. Additionally, consider whether the tool provides options for manual editing or professional review to enhance the transcription's accuracy and reliability.\n\n### Integration and Compatibility \n\nIntegration and compatibility are crucial factors when selecting a free YouTube transcription tool. As content creators and businesses increasingly rely on multiple platforms and data sources, the ability to seamlessly connect these tools with existing workflows becomes paramount. Many transcription tools now offer APIs or plugins that allow for easy integration with popular video editing software, content management systems, and analytics platforms.\n\nFurthermore, compatibility with various file formats and languages is essential for a versatile transcription tool. The best free options support a wide range of audio and video file types, enabling users to transcribe content from different sources beyond YouTube. Some tools even provide multilingual support, offering transcription and translation capabilities for global audiences. When evaluating free YouTube transcription tools, consider how well they integrate with your current tech stack and whether they can accommodate your specific language and file format needs.\n\n# Conclusion: Making the Most of Free YouTube Transcription Tools in 2024 \n\nAs we wrap up our exploration of free YouTube transcription tools in 2024, it's clear that these resources have become invaluable for content creators, researchers, and businesses alike. The landscape of video content continues to evolve, making accurate transcriptions more crucial than ever for accessibility, SEO, and content repurposing.\n\nWhile each tool we've discussed has its strengths, the key is finding the one that best suits your specific needs. Whether you prioritize speed, accuracy, or additional features like translation, there's a free option out there for you.

You can use it to make written records of almost anything, to improve the accessibility of your online content, or to maximize your SEO.\n\nThere are plenty of free options out there than can deliver results if you have the time to do it yourself.\n\nHere are five free transcription tools we have tried.\n\n## 1. OTranscribe\n\nOTranscribe\u00a0is a free, open-source tool that can be used straight out of your web browser. It has a simple interface which lets you control the audio player and text editor in the same window, which means you don\u2019t need to click out of tabs to stop and start the audio. Everything can be controlled through your keyboard, and interactive timestamps help you navigate the transcript. OTranscribe also saves your progress automatically as you go.\n\nTo start, just upload an audio or video file or enter a link to a YouTube video. The player will then sit to the left of the text box so you can do all your work in one window.\n\n## 2. Express Scribe\n\nExpress Scribe\u00a0is a popular industry tool designed for professional transcribers. It can be installed for free on a Mac or PC and lets you control everything through your keyboard or by linking to a\u00a0foot pedal. It has an easy-to-learn interface and features a broad range of hotkey controls for better speed and efficiency.\n\nThere is both a free version and a paid version of Express Scribe. The free version includes foot pedal support and can play a wide range of audio file types.\n\n## 3. The FTW Transcriber\n\nAnother popular option for professional transcribers,\u00a0The FTW Transcriber\u00a0is a downloadable tool with high-quality audio playback. It supports a range of audio and video file types and features automatic timestamps.\n\nThis tool appears as a small orange box on your screen, which you can move around to your preferred spot. Within the box, you can play, pause, adjust volume, and skip forward and backward on the audio.\n\n## 4. Inqscribe\n\nInqscribe\u00a0is a downloadable tool with a simple interface that allows users to do all their transcription in one window. It features a wide range of keyboard shortcuts, which can be customised to your style and needs. Inqscribe allows you to create snippets, so you can insert any frequently-used expressions into your transcript with a simple keystroke. You can insert time codes anywhere in the transcript, and create a\u00a0closed captions\u00a0file from these later on.\n\nThe Inqscribe media player can play audio and video from a URL, a server, files from your hard drive, flash drive or CD.\n\n## 5. Transcribe\n\nTranscribe is a streamlined tool that provides two options for transcription, depending on your preferred style. Transcribe your file in the traditional method by typing it out, or use Transcribe\u2019s dictation feature, which converts your voice into text using voice recognition.\n\n### Typing option\n\nIf you\u2019re using the traditional transcription option, Transcribe features a tightly integrated player and editor that you can use to control the speed of the audio as you type. It also has an automatic text expander which allows you to use snippets instead of typing out long passages of text multiple times.\n\n### Dictation option\n\nThe dictation option is easy to use, and generally faster than typing. To use this option, you\u2019ll need a microphone set-up. If you\u2019re using just your voice, simply begin speaking into the app and see your words come up on screen. To transcribe from a file with audio, you will need to listen to the audio and repeat what you hear into the microphone. This is similar to how Ai-Media\u2019s respeakers work to create live captions. It might take some practice!\n\n## There\u2019s no stopping you now!\n\nGet one step closer to becoming a top transcriber by trying out one of the tools we\u2019ve suggested.\n\nAnd if doing the hard yards of transcription is not for you, you can get your audio and video files transcribed by one of Ai-Media\u2019s experts for a small fee.

My original host automatically did transcriptions, but since joining a large network, we've had to switch over to Megaphone. Unfortunately, they don't do transcriptions. I am trying to do this for free, or at least really cheap. Who do you use? I've considered trying Otter.ai but free version doesn't let you use pre recorded audio, which is what I'd want to try before I buy. \n\nThank you! \n\n Share   Add a comment\n\nSort by: \n\nBest\n\nOpen comment sort options\n\n* Best\n\n* Top\n\n* New\n\n* Controversial\n\n* Old\n\n* Q&A\n\n Top 2%   Rank by size  \n\n#  More posts you may like \n\n* * *\n\n######  Related discussions \n\n*  Best Free Transcription Software  \n*  Best Transcription Software for Qualitative Research  \n*  Best Text to Speech API  \n*  Best Text to Speech App Free  \n*  Best Paying Transcription Jobs  \n*  Best Voice To Text App For Writers  \n*  Best Dictation Software for Writers  \n*  Best Dictation App  \n*  Best Text To Speech AI  \n*  Best Voice Cloning AI  \n*  Best Medical Dictation Software  \n*  Best AI Voice Generator  \n*  Best Dictation App for Android  \n*  Best Voice Translator App  \n*  Best Text to Video AI  \n*  BEST VOICE RECORDER APP  \n*  Best Speech To Text App  \n*  Best Voice Note Taking App  \n\n##  Top Posts \n\n* * *\n\n  *  .snoo-cls-1 { fill: url(#snoo-radial-gragient);

However, the accuracy of auto-generated captions depends on the clarity of the video\u2019s audio, and they may require manual corrections for precision.\n\n##### Method 2 Manual Transcription\n\nIf you want a highly accurate transcript, manual transcription is a reliable method. Listen to the video and type the text manually. Although this process is time-consuming, it ensures that every detail is captured accurately. This method is particularly useful for videos with specialized terminology or poor audio quality.\n\n## Part 3: Wondershare DemoCreator: The Best Tool for Transcribing YouTube Videos to Text\n\nWondershare DemoCreator is a cutting-edge solution for converting YouTube sound to text with ease and precision.

They were the cheapest, good option, but they recently raised their pricing. I'm not sure how competitive their new pricing is as I'm grandfathered in, but I like them. You can try them for free.\u00a0\n\nIf you have the Adobe Creative Suite around somewhere, Premiere does automated transcription of everything you load into it, and it's pretty good. Advantages: you don't have to upload anything to the cloud, it's unlimited so effectively free if you already have Premiere. It is integrated with video editing, so everything you edit from the original is also transcribed as edited. You can improve the audio quality and re-transcribe if the original audio is weak, or if there are tracks you need to eliminate, and so on. Disadvantages: manual editing of the text is a bit clumsy compared to the cloud service, exporting is limited, and it's not shared automatically. You can export the transcripts, but only in text format, with no control over the formatting. Functional but maybe not ideal. I still use Otter a lot for bulk transcription of material I need to share with others prior to editing.\n\nIf the audio is bad and you are not getting a good transcript, try AI noise reduction. You can use very aggressive noise reduction to make bad audio more easily transcribed even if sounds awful to your ear. I like AudoStudio.com but there are many.\u00a0\n\nFinally, re-reading can be a very effective problem solver. Essentially, you use any voice-to-text trained to your voice, listen to the recording and repeat to your voice-to-text, rather than typing. It's a bit tricky and slower, but can be a lifesaver for heavy accents or highly technical originals. It allows you to correct as you go, and even train the software. The brain is still smarter than AI.\n\n------------------------------  \nTod Hopkins   \nHoptod LLC   \n443-472-5978   \ntodhopkins@me.com  \n------------------------------  \n\n  Original Message\n\nOriginal Message:  \nSent: 11-02-2023 02:30 PM   \nFrom: Keith Cook   \nSubject: Affordable Video-to-Text Transcription Software  \n\nHello, all.

You'd have to convert the videos to an audio only format to run them through I think, but what I was reading was talking about it putting a major dent in Otter.AI's business model. While the software is $60 or so, if you\u2019re doing bulk conversion it might be cheaper. I was planning to play around with it soon, but here's a link to a short write-up. If you're open to Mac, might be something worth checking out.\n\n------------------------------  \nDrew Whatley   \nMuseum Educator   \nWhatcom Museum   \nBellingham WA  \n------------------------------  \n\n  Original Message\n\nOriginal Message:  \nSent: 11-02-2023 02:30 PM   \nFrom: Keith Cook   \nSubject: Affordable Video-to-Text Transcription Software  \n\nHello, all.

AWS is a pay for the actual processing you undertake model. Both work well, though both too have challenges with particular speakers and dialectical differences in pronunciation. Both do require you to do post-processing clean up and transcription document formatting, so it may make sense to outsource the work. We have found this to be especially the case if the AIs seem to perform poorly with a particular speaker.\u00a0  \n\nCheers,\n\nChris\u00a0\n\n------------------------------  \nChristopher von Nagy, Ph.D.  \nHead, Shared History Program   \nApplied and Public History / Museum Studies   \n\nDepartment of History   \nMailstop 0308   \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, 79557   \n\nExhibit gallery: First floor of Lincoln Hall and LH120 (Gallery120)  \n\nhttps://www.unr.edu/history/shared/digital-history  \n------------------------------  \n\n  Original Message\n\nOriginal Message:  \nSent: 11-02-2023 02:30 PM   \nFrom: Keith Cook   \nSubject: Affordable Video-to-Text Transcription Software   \n\nHello, all.

These apps record and make text transcriptions of important conversations. So, for example, when you're having an important conversation with a lawyer, a doctor, or your insurance company, it's really handy to be able to check exactly what was said later. And, of course, it's vital for writers and journalists, who need to keep records of their interviews. \nFor many years, there have been two types of transcription services available online: ones that use an AI engine and ones that use human transcribers. The latter are usually much more accurate but are also considerably more expensive. Recently, as AI transcriptions have become more precise, they have become more popular and available. \nWhat follows are short looks at some of the AI-powered transcription services available. We've concentrated on apps that have a free version (or, at least, a free trial for new users) and that are priced for the individual rather than for organizations.\nBut first, a note: the quality of transcription supplied by these apps can vary widely depending not only on the AI engine the app is using but also on the quality of your audio. If there are a lot of voices talking at once, if there is a lot of background noise, if the speakers have accents unfamiliar to the AI tool - those can all serve to degrade the accuracy of the transcription. So, a good idea is to try out a transcription service with a free or trial version first to see which works best for your particular needs.\nOtter\nOtter's interface offers several AI features, including an outline and summary of the transcript.Otter is one of the more popular transcription services, although it's not inexpensive. The app offers a fairly impressive range of services, including the ability to easily record Zoom and Google Meet meetings and organize your transcriptions into folders and your contacts into groups. There is also a separate AI feature that helps with content searches, and each transcription includes an AI-generated summary, including a list of action items and an outline.\nThere were some unfortunate limitations on the service that were imposed back in 2022. If you're a free user, you currently only have access to your last 25 transcriptions (the others will be archived). You can have up to 300 transcription minutes per month with a maximum of 30 minutes per conversation, and you can import a lifetime total of up to three audio or video files.\nPaying customers who are on Otter's Pro plan ($16.99 / month or $99.96 a year) get 1,200 minutes per month and 90 minutes per conversation; all their conversations are available, and they can import 10 audio or video conversations per month. Otter's Business plan ($30 a month or $240 annually) has 6,000 minutes per month / four hours per conversation allowance, along with other features. \nTemi\nTemi has a straightforward, easy to understand interface.Temi is a basic transcription service that is owned by the same company that owns Rev - in fact, the first time you go there, it's likely you'll find yourself being urged to try Rev first. Once you've gotten past that, Temi offers such features as the ability to review and edit your transcriptions, slow down the replay, and export your files into text (Microsoft Word, PDF) or closed caption (SRT, VTT) files. Its mobile apps for Android and iOS allow you to record audio; you can then choose to transcribe it for a straightforward 25 cents per audio minute or upload your own recordings for the same price. New users get the first 45 minutes free. \nRev\nRev has added a number of AI features to its automated transcriptions.Rev has been around for a while; until a few years ago, it was mainly available for those who wanted human transcription services. Now, the company offers AI transcription with an option for human transcription. You can try it out with the Free plan's 45 minutes of transcription a month; after that, the Basic plan offers 20 hours of automated English transcription services, along with Spanish and French transcriptions, for $9.99 per month. You also get a 10 percent discount on any human-based transcription services. The Pro plan advances that to 60 hours of AI transcription with a 15 percent discount on human transcription and a 38-language capability. There is a 14-day free trial period. \nMeetGeek\nMeetGeek concentrates on recording and transcribing meetings.MeetGeek is actually a video rather than an audio recording / transcribing service. Its concentration is on transcribing meetings; it creates transcriptions automatically for Zoom, Meet, and Teams meetings, puts together summaries, and extracts highlights. The Free version lets you record five hours a month and retain three months' worth of transcripts and one month's worth of audio; you also have a limited ability to change your settings. For $19 a month or $180 a year, a Pro version gives you 20 hours of transcription a month, one year of transcript retention, and six months of video storage. New users get a 14-day trial of the Business plan, which costs $39 a month or $372 a year and gets you 100 hours of transcription a month, unlimited transcript storage, and 12 months of video retention.\nSonix\nSonix uses a pay-as-you-go plan.Sonix offers automated translations in over 49 languages. It includes the usual ability to edit its transcripts, a word-by-word timestamp, and the ability to upload transcripts from other programs and stitch them to new ones. Like many transcription services these days, it has added some AI features such as automated subtitles and summaries. You can export your transcripts in DOCX, TXT, and PDF, and export subtitles in SRT and VTT formats. Sonix starts with a pay-as-you-go Standard plan that costs $10 an audio hour (prorated to the nearest minute). There is also a Premium subscription plan ($5 per audio hour plus $22 / month or $198 / year) that adds several features and 100GB of storage. New users get 30 free minutes of transcription.\nAlice\nAlice sends your recordings and transcriptions to your email address.While MeetGeek concentrates on meeting transcriptions, Alice touts itself as a transcription service for journalists. The other services store your transcripts (some with time limits, some without) and let you edit them online, but Alice doesn't; instead, it sends the audio file and the transcript to your email address and adds it to your Google Drive or Dropbox. It is also easy to use; just tap anywhere on the phone app to start it and swipe to pause. Alice is pay-as-you-go, depending on how long you think your transcript might be: approximately 4,800 words for $9.99 an hour, about 48,000 words for $4.99 an hour, and about 240,000 words for $2.99 an hour. You get the first 60 minutes free and can use it with an iOS app or the web. There is no Android app.\nGoogle Recorder\n\nGoogle Recorder is a basic transcription app.\nYou can also view a transcript of the captured audio.\n\nIf you have an Android phone, one of the easiest ways to get a decent transcription is to use Google's free Recorder app. (If you have a Pixel, you may already have it; otherwise, you can download Recorder from the Play Store to see if it works with your phone.) To start a recording, you simply press a large red button. To pause, you press it again. Smaller buttons on either side let you delete or save the recording. Above the button is the timing of the audio, and above that are two buttons for Audio and Transcript. To see the text, tap Transcript. You can edit the text, search through it (this is Google after all), and share either the audio or the transcript. If you have a Pixel 6 or later, you can enable different labels for different speakers. \nBy the way, if you've got an iPhone, you can record audio using the built-in Voice Memo app; you can then download a transcription app from the App Store and share your recording with the app. The upcoming iOS 18 is expected to include AI call recording and transcription.\nTurboScribe\nTurboScribe is currently web-only, but includes some interesting features.TurboScribe is a relatively new service that is currently web-only but has some nice features, such as the ability to choose whether you want your transcription created more quickly or more accurately. It also has speaker recognition and (if you have the paid version) language translation. You can also use AI to remove background noise (which TurboScribe advises to use \"only as a last resort\"). However, because it doesn't have a separate app, it's not as easy to start a recording as with, say, Otter or Google Recorder - and if you tab away from the app, it might stop recording. \nTurboScribe Free lets you record three conversations a day for up to 30 minutes each, which isn't a bad deal. TurboScribe Unlimited gives you unlimited transcriptions, up to 10 hours per conversation, faster transcriptions, and language translation; it costs $20 a month or $120 a year. \nUpdate August 28th, 2024: This article was originally published on August 24th, 2022.

In general, casual users typically value solutions that are either free or very low cost, require little setup, and can quickly provide a \u201cgood\u2010enough\u201d transcript with minimal manual intervention. Here are a few approaches and tools to consider:\n\n---\n\n### 1. YouTube\u2019s Built\u2010In Transcription Feature\n\n**Overview:**  \nEvery YouTube video that has auto\u2010generated captions offers a built\u2011in transcript (accessible via the \u201c\u2026 More\u201d or \u201cTranscript\u201d button on the video\u2019s page).  \n**Pros:**  \n\u2022 Completely free with no extra software needed.  \n\u2022 Instant access if the video has captions enabled.  \n**Cons:**  \n\u2022 Accuracy can be hit\u2010or\u2010miss (especially with strong accents or noisy audio).  \n\u2022 Requires manual copy/paste if you need the text elsewhere.\n\n*Ideal for users who need a quick, no\u2011cost solution for occasional use.*  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 2. Free AI-Powered Transcription Services (Otter.ai, Notta, and Others)\n\n**Otter.ai (Free Tier):**  \n\u2022 Offers automated transcription with a friendly interface that supports meeting-like recordings.  \n\u2022 The free plan provides up to 300 minutes per month with a per\u2011conversation cap (typically around 30 minutes), which suits the needs of someone transcribing a few YouTube videos or clips.  \n**Pros:**  \n\u2022 Minimal setup with mobile and web apps.  \n\u2022 Includes features like speaker identification and searchable transcripts.  \n**Cons:**  \n\u2022 Limits on minutes may require occasional upgrading if usage increases.\n\n**Notta or Similar Chrome Extensions:**  \n\u2022 Some browser\u2011based tools (for example, the Notta Chrome extension) allow you to capture audio directly from your computer and generate a transcript.  \n\u2022 These tend to be designed for ease of use with minimal configuration and can often import audio from videos.  \n**Overall:**  \nThese options are excellent for casual home users who want to \u201crecord\u201d the audio as it plays and have the tool do the transcription automatically.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 3. Google Docs Voice Typing\n\n**Overview:**  \nGoogle Docs offers a \u201cVoice Typing\u201d feature that works surprisingly well when you play a YouTube video (ensuring the audio is clear and at an adequate volume).  \n**Pros:**  \n\u2022 It\u2019s completely free as part of Google Docs.  \n\u2022 No need to sign up for new services if you already use Google\u2019s suite of apps.  \n**Cons:**  \n\u2022 Requires you to route the video\u2019s audio (or use a microphone in a quiet room) so that Google\u2019s speech recognition can capture it.  \n\u2022 May need manual editing for punctuation and timing.\n\n*Best for users who prefer a hands\u2011on, no\u2011cost solution and don\u2019t mind a little extra manual cleanup.*  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 4. Online YouTube Transcript Extractors\n\n**Example \u2013 youtubetotranscript.net:**  \n\u2022 Some websites let you simply paste the URL of a YouTube video, and they automatically pull the auto\u2011generated transcript.  \n**Pros:**  \n\u2022 Simple, fast, and completely free.  \n\u2022 No installation or account required.  \n**Cons:**  \n\u2022 Relies on YouTube\u2019s own auto\u2011captions (and so inherits their inaccuracies).  \n\u2022 Not every video will have a transcript available (if captions are turned off or not generated).\n\n*These tools are excellent for quick one\u2011off tasks, especially when you only need a rough transcript to work with or for reference.*  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nFor the casual home user, the best approach often depends on your needs:\n- **For an entirely free option with zero additional software:** Start with YouTube\u2019s own transcript or use an online extractor.\n- **For a bit more functionality (searchable, editable, and with a friendlier interface):** Consider a free tier of an AI transcription service like Otter.ai.\n- **If you\u2019re comfortable with a DIY method and already use Google Docs:** Voice Typing can work very well under good audio conditions.\n\nEach of these options offers a balance between ease of use, cost, and accuracy. For most home users\u2014whether you\u2019re transcribing a few educational videos, personal recordings, or hobby projects\u2014the above methods provide an effective and low\u2011barrier entry into making your video content more accessible and searchable.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":956,"end_idx":975,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Top 10 Free YouTube Transcription Tools in 2024 - Insight7","url":"https://insight7.io/top-10-free-youtube-transcription-tools-in-2024/","attribution":"insight7.io","pub_date":1720515600.0,"snippet":"One popular choice is YouTube's built-in auto-generated captions, which provide a quick and easy starting point for transcription.

Here are some of the top contenders:\n\n### Otter.ai  \nOtter is widely praised for its high-quality transcriptions\u2014especially for meetings and lectures. Its strength lies in features like speaker identification, real\u2011time transcription, searchable transcripts, and AI\u2011generated summaries. Users appreciate its ease of use and robust integration with popular meeting platforms. While its free tier has some usage limits, the Pro version is well regarded for consistent accuracy when audio is clear.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue201\n\n### Rev\u2019s AI Transcription Service  \nRev is known for offering both human and AI transcription options. Its AI service is noted for delivering fast turnaround times with a high degree of accuracy, and it provides an easy upgrade path to human transcription if additional precision is needed. This hybrid approach has earned Rev a reputation for reliability among professionals who need dependable results without waiting for manual processing.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue201\n\n### Sonix  \nSonix has earned strong reviews for its accuracy, especially when dealing with multiple languages (it supports transcriptions in 49 languages) and its user\u2011friendly editing interface. Its automated transcription, combined with tools for refining and exporting transcripts in various formats, makes it a favorite among users who need both quality and flexibility.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue201\n\n### Descript  \nThough Descript is more than just a transcription tool\u2014it\u2019s an integrated audio and video editing suite\u2014it leverages AI to deliver high\u2011quality transcriptions. Its text\u2011based editing interface allows users to correct errors easily while synchronizing changes with the original audio/video. This integrated workflow is especially valued by content creators and podcasters who need a reliable, all\u2011in\u2011one solution.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue201\n\n### Emerging Whisper-Based Solutions  \nMany new platforms are built on OpenAI\u2019s Whisper engine, which is recognized for its state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art accuracy. Although these tools sometimes require technical setup or additional post\u2011processing, the underlying model is widely cited as one of the most reliable for clear, high\u2011quality transcriptions. Many commercial products (including some features in Descript and others) have integrated Whisper to boost their performance.\n\n### Final Thoughts  \nFor users seeking the best quality and reliability in AI transcription:\n- **Otter.ai** is excellent for regular meeting and lecture transcriptions.\n- **Rev\u2019s AI service** offers a strong blend of speed and accuracy with an option for human review.\n- **Sonix** is a great choice when multilingual support and a powerful editing interface are needed.\n- **Descript** appeals to creators who want integrated transcription and editing features.\n- **Platforms built on OpenAI\u2019s Whisper** are emerging as strong contenders if you\u2019re comfortable with a bit more technical setup or integrated within larger editing tools.\n\nEach of these services has been noted by industry publications (such as The Verge) and user reviews for delivering consistently reliable results when the source audio is of good quality.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue201","start_idx":633,"end_idx":651,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Find the best AI-powered app to transcribe your audio","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23316220/transcription-ai-otter-temi-how-to","attribution":"theverge.com","pub_date":1724866591.0,"snippet":"Transcription apps are valuable for recording important conversations, with AI-driven and human transcriber options available.

This example uses the open\u2011source Whisper package directly to load a model, process an audio file, and print out the transcript without any extra bells and whistles.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Python Installation:** Make sure you have Python 3.7 or newer installed.\n2. **Install Dependencies:**  \n   \u2022 Install the Whisper package (which depends on ffmpeg for audio processing).  \n   \u2022 On macOS you can install ffmpeg via Homebrew; on Windows you might install it via Chocolatey or download it manually.\n\nYou can install Whisper directly from GitHub with pip:\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git\n```\n\nAlso, ensure ffmpeg is installed on your system (e.g., for macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`).\n\n### The Minimal Code Example\n\nBelow is a simple Python script that loads a Whisper model (choose \u201cbase\u201d, \u201csmall\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, or \u201clarge\u201d depending on your hardware and quality needs), processes an audio file, and prints the transcript:\n\n```python\nimport whisper\n\n# Load a pre-trained Whisper model; choose \"base\" for speed or \"large\" for higher accuracy.\nmodel = whisper.load_model(\"base\")\n\n# Load and preprocess the audio file (supported formats include mp3, wav, etc.)\naudio = whisper.load_audio(\"your_audio_file.mp3\")\naudio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio)\n\n# Convert audio to log-Mel spectrogram required by the model\nmel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device)\n\n# Optionally, detect the spoken language (this step is useful for multi-language audio)\n_, probs = model.detect_language(mel)\ndetected_language = max(probs, key=probs.get)\nprint(f\"Detected language: {detected_language}\")\n\n# Set decoding options; you can adjust parameters like temperature if needed.\noptions = whisper.DecodingOptions()\n\n# Run the model to decode the spectrogram into text.\nresult = whisper.decode(model, mel, options)\n\n# Print the quality transcript.\nprint(\"Transcription:\")\nprint(result.text)\n```\n\n### How This Works\n\n1. **Loading the Model:**  \n   The script calls `whisper.load_model(\"base\")` to load a chosen model size. For better quality (at the cost of speed and hardware requirements), you can choose `\"small\"`, `\"medium\"`, or `\"large\"`.\n\n2. **Audio Processing:**  \n   The audio is loaded and then padded or trimmed to the expected duration using `whisper.pad_or_trim()`. The audio is converted to a log\u2011Mel spectrogram\u2014a representation that the model uses for transcription.\n\n3. **Language Detection (Optional):**  \n   The model can detect the language of the input, which is printed out. This step is optional but can be useful when processing multi\u2011language inputs.\n\n4. **Decoding:**  \n   With `whisper.decode()`, the model processes the spectrogram and outputs the transcript in text form. This simple example uses default decoding options, which you can customize if needed.\n\n5. **Output:**  \n   Finally, the transcript is printed to the console.\n\n### Final Notes\n\nThis script provides a quality transcript from an audio file using the Whisper engine with minimal functionality. You can expand on this basic tool later by adding features like saving the transcript to a file or processing batches of files.\n\nFor further reading and additional configuration options, you can refer to:\n\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\nThis approach should suit your needs if you only require a quality transcript without additional functionality."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201","start_idx":3316,"end_idx":3335,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"How to Turn Audio to Text using OpenAI Whisper - freeCodeCamp","url":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-turn-audio-to-text-using-openai-whisper/","attribution":"freecodecamp.org","pub_date":1709596800.0,"snippet":"How to Work with Whisper.

Note that the exact needs depend on which model you choose (e.g., tiny, base, small, medium, or large) and whether you plan to run inference on a CPU or use GPU acceleration for faster processing.\n\n---\n\n### CPU-Only Usage\n\n- **General Requirements:**  \n  \u2022 A modern multi\u2011core CPU with at least 8\u202fGB of RAM can run the smaller Whisper models (such as tiny, base, or small).  \n  \u2022 Keep in mind that while CPU-only inference is possible, it is significantly slower\u2014especially on longer audio files or when using larger models.\n\n- **Limitations:**  \n  \u2022 For longer recordings or for models like medium and large, CPU-only processing may become impractically slow for everyday use.\n\n---\n\n### GPU-Accelerated Usage\n\n- **Benefits:**  \n  \u2022 A dedicated GPU dramatically speeds up inference.  \n  \u2022 GPU acceleration is especially beneficial for higher\u2011quality models (medium or large) where the computation requirements are greater.\n\n- **Recommended GPU Specifications:**  \n  \u2022 **Smaller Models (tiny, base, small):** Often run comfortably on GPUs with around 4\u20136\u202fGB of VRAM.  \n  \u2022 **Larger Models (medium, large):** Typically require a GPU with at least 10\u202fGB of VRAM. Modern GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX series or comparable cards) are recommended to achieve near real\u2011time processing.\n\n- **Other Considerations:**  \n  \u2022 Ensure you have the appropriate version of PyTorch installed with CUDA support to fully leverage your GPU.  \n  \u2022 The operating system should be one of Linux, Windows, or macOS, and you must also have FFmpeg installed for audio preprocessing.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **For quick, high\u2011quality transcription:** Running the medium or large Whisper model on a GPU with 10\u202fGB or more VRAM is ideal.  \n- **For occasional or smaller tasks:** Using one of the smaller models on a CPU might suffice, albeit with slower processing speeds.\n\nIn short, if your primary goal is quality and efficiency\u2014and you\u2019re planning to process longer or multiple files\u2014investing in a modern GPU with sufficient VRAM (around 10\u202fGB or more) is highly recommended. This setup ensures that you can take full advantage of Whisper\u2019s capabilities without enduring lengthy processing times.\n\n\ue200cite\ue202turn1news10\ue201  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news10\ue201","start_idx":2257,"end_idx":2275,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201","start_idx":2278,"end_idx":2297,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]}],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"8f186208-375d-4930-9494-0c002011fe19","request_id":"90be8bbb3e9ace32-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8f186208-375d-4930-9494-0c002011fe19","children":["6ac34e53-b59d-4e1b-8a1d-cabe5bb2e142"]},"6ac34e53-b59d-4e1b-8a1d-cabe5bb2e142":{"id":"6ac34e53-b59d-4e1b-8a1d-cabe5bb2e142","message":{"id":"6ac34e53-b59d-4e1b-8a1d-cabe5bb2e142","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738545179.794527,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Can I use whisper via the OpenAI API?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"system_hints":["search"],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"90be8e4aaa01ce32-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aca56bdf-0040-4381-9c7e-77ead0b0be04","children":["f2cf0011-06ca-4ab3-9561-26e3fa7feda2"]},"f2cf0011-06ca-4ab3-9561-26e3fa7feda2":{"id":"f2cf0011-06ca-4ab3-9561-26e3fa7feda2","message":{"id":"f2cf0011-06ca-4ab3-9561-26e3fa7feda2","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738545243.352459,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"6ac34e53-b59d-4e1b-8a1d-cabe5bb2e142","request_id":"90be8e4aaa01ce32-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"assistant","channel":null},"parent":"6ac34e53-b59d-4e1b-8a1d-cabe5bb2e142","children":["539d6b42-f555-4d1b-8854-09adcca2fe3c"]},"539d6b42-f555-4d1b-8854-09adcca2fe3c":{"id":"539d6b42-f555-4d1b-8854-09adcca2fe3c","message":{"id":"539d6b42-f555-4d1b-8854-09adcca2fe3c","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1738545243.352571,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned about Whisper via OpenAI API for a second","initial_text":"Reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"f2cf0011-06ca-4ab3-9561-26e3fa7feda2","finished_duration_sec":0,"request_id":"90be8e4aaa01ce32-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f2cf0011-06ca-4ab3-9561-26e3fa7feda2","children":["88a475e2-06bd-4651-816c-df9e47e44d0a"]},"88a475e2-06bd-4651-816c-df9e47e44d0a":{"id":"88a475e2-06bd-4651-816c-df9e47e44d0a","message":{"id":"88a475e2-06bd-4651-816c-df9e47e44d0a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738545243.352653,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"json","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"query\": \"Can I use Whisper via the OpenAI API?\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"539d6b42-f555-4d1b-8854-09adcca2fe3c","request_id":"90be8e4aaa01ce32-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.search","channel":null},"parent":"539d6b42-f555-4d1b-8854-09adcca2fe3c","children":["6c7376f6-bf0b-4c0c-b1bd-3ada50f7df9d"]},"6c7376f6-bf0b-4c0c-b1bd-3ada50f7df9d":{"id":"6c7376f6-bf0b-4c0c-b1bd-3ada50f7df9d","message":{"id":"6c7376f6-bf0b-4c0c-b1bd-3ada50f7df9d","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.search","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.search"}},"create_time":1738545243.352802,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Context for search results:\nToday is Monday, February 03, 2025 at 09:13:01 AM in the time zone 'Asia/Singapore'.

Mentions of the ChatGPT API in this blog refer to the GPT-3.5 Turbo API.\n\nChatGPT and Whisper models are now available on our API, giving developers access to cutting-edge language (not just chat!) and speech-to-text capabilities. Through a series of system-wide optimizations, we\u2019ve achieved 90% cost reduction for ChatGPT since December; we\u2019re now passing through those savings to API users. Developers can now use our open-source Whisper large-v2 model in the API with much faster and cost-effective results. GPT-3.5 API users can expect continuous model improvements and the option to choose dedicated capacity for deeper control over the models. We\u2019ve also listened closely to feedback from our developers and refined our API terms of service to better meet their needs.\n\n  * Get started (opens in a new window)\n\n## Early users of GPT-3.5 Turbo and Whisper APIs\n\nSnap Inc \u2060 (opens in a new window)., the creator of Snapchat, introduced My AI for Snapchat+ this week. The experimental feature is running on GPT-3.5 API. My AI offers Snapchatters a friendly, customizable chatbot at their fingertips that offers recommendations, and can even write a haiku for friends in seconds. Snapchat, where communication and messaging is a daily behavior, has 750 million monthly Snapchatters:\n\nMy AI for Snapchat+\n\nQuizlet \u2060 (opens in a new window) is a global learning platform with more than 60 million students using it to study, practice and master whatever they\u2019re learning. Quizlet has worked with OpenAI for the last three years, leveraging GPT-3 across multiple use cases, including vocabulary learning and practice tests. With the launch of GPT-3.5 API, Quizlet is introducing Q-Chat, a fully-adaptive AI tutor that engages students with adaptive questions based on relevant study materials delivered through a fun chat experience:\n\nQuizlet Q-Chat\n\nInstacart \u2060 (opens in a new window) is augmenting the Instacart app to enable customers to ask about food and get inspirational, shoppable answers. This uses ChatGPT alongside Instacart\u2019s own AI and product data from their 75,000+ retail partner store locations to help customers discover ideas for open-ended shopping goals, such as \u201cHow do I make great fish tacos?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s a healthy lunch for my kids?\u201d Instacart plans to launch \u201cAsk Instacart\u201d later this year:\n\nInstacart\u2019s Ask Instacart\n\nShop \u2060 (opens in a new window), Shopify\u2019s consumer app, is used by 100 million shoppers to find and engage with the products and brands they love. GPT-3.5 API is used to power Shop\u2019s new shopping assistant. When shoppers search for products, the shopping assistant makes personalized recommendations based on their requests. Shop\u2019s new AI-powered shopping assistant will streamline in-app shopping by scanning millions of products to quickly find what buyers are looking for\u2014or help them discover something new:\n\nShopify\u2019s Shop app\n\nSpeak \u2060 (opens in a new window) is an AI-powered language learning app focused on building the best path to spoken fluency. They\u2019re the fastest-growing English app in South Korea, and are already using the Whisper API to power a new AI speaking companion product, and rapidly bring it to the rest of the globe. Whisper\u2019s human-level accuracy for language learners of every level unlocks true open-ended conversational practice and highly accurate feedback:\n\nThe Speak app \n\n## GPT-3.5 API \n\nModel: The ChatGPT model family we are releasing today, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, is the same model used in the ChatGPT product. It is priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is 10x cheaper than our existing GPT-3.5 models. It\u2019s also our best model for many non-chat use cases\u2014we\u2019ve seen early testers migrate from `text-davinci-003` to `gpt-3.5-turbo` with only a small amount of adjustment needed to their prompts.\n\nAPI: Traditionally, GPT models consume unstructured text, which is represented to the model as a sequence of \u201ctokens.\u201d ChatGPT models instead consume a sequence of messages together with metadata. (For the curious: under the hood, the input is still rendered to the model as a sequence of \u201ctokens\u201d for the model to consume; the raw format used by the model is a new format called Chat Markup Language \u2060 (opens in a new window) (\u201cChatML\u201d).)\n\nWe\u2019ve created a new endpoint to interact with our ChatGPT models:\n\nLoading...\n\nTo learn more about the GPT-3.5 API, visit our Chat guide \u2060 (opens in a new window).\n\n## ChatGPT upgrades \n\nWe are constantly improving our ChatGPT models, and want to make these enhancements available to developers as well. Developers who use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model will always get our recommended stable model, while still having the flexibility to opt for a specific model version. For example, today we\u2019re releasing `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301`, which will be supported through at least June 1st, and we\u2019ll update `gpt-3.5-turbo` to a new stable release in April. The models page \u2060 (opens in a new window) will provide switchover updates.\n\n## Dedicated instances \n\nWe are also now offering dedicated instances for users who want deeper control over the specific model version and system performance. By default, requests are run on compute infrastructure shared with other users, who pay per request. Our API runs on Azure, and with dedicated instances, developers will pay by time period for an allocation of compute infrastructure that\u2019s reserved for serving their requests.\n\nDevelopers get full control over the instance\u2019s load (higher load improves throughput but makes each request slower), the option to enable features such as longer context limits, and the ability to pin the model snapshot.\n\nDedicated instances can make economic sense for developers running beyond ~450M tokens per day. Additionally, it enables\u00a0directly optimizing a developer\u2019s workload against\u00a0hardware performance, which can dramatically reduce costs relative to shared infrastructure. For dedicated instance inquiries, contact us \u2060.\n\n## Whisper API\n\nWhisper \u2060, the speech-to-text model we open-sourced in September 2022, has received immense praise from the developer community but\u00a0can also be hard to run. We\u2019ve now made the large-v2 model available through our API, which gives convenient on-demand access priced at $0.006 / minute. In addition, our highly-optimized serving stack ensures faster performance compared to other services.\n\nWhisper API is available through our `transcriptions` (transcribes in source language) or `translations` (transcribes into English) endpoints, and accepts a variety of formats (m4a, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, wav, webm):\n\nLoading...\n\nTo learn more about the Whisper API, visit our Speech to Text guide \u2060 (opens in a new window).\n\n## Developer focus \n\nOver the past six months, we\u2019ve been collecting feedback from our API customers to understand how we can better serve them. We\u2019ve made concrete changes, such as:\n\n  * Data submitted through the API is no longer used for service improvements (including model training) unless the organization opts in \n\n  * Implementing a default 30-day data retention policy for API users, with options for stricter retention depending on user needs.\n\n  * Removing our pre-launch review (unlocked by improving our automated monitoring)\n\n  * Improving developer documentation \n\n  * Simplifying our Terms of Service and Usage Policies \u2060 (opens in a new window), including terms around data ownership: users own the input and output of the models.\n\nFor the past two months our uptime has not met our own expectations nor that of our users. Our engineering team\u2019s top priority is now stability of production use cases\u2014we know that ensuring AI benefits all of humanity requires being a reliable service provider. Please hold us accountable for improved uptime over the upcoming months!\n\nWe believe that AI can provide incredible opportunities and economic empowerment to everyone, and the best way to achieve that is to allow everyone to build with it.

We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech\u00a0processing.\n\nASR Summary Of Model Architecture\n\nThe Whisper architecture is a simple end-to-end approach, implemented as an encoder-decoder Transformer. Input audio is split into 30-second chunks, converted into a log-Mel spectrogram, and then passed into an encoder. A decoder is trained to predict the corresponding text caption, intermixed with special tokens that direct the single model to perform tasks such as language identification, phrase-level timestamps, multilingual speech transcription, and to-English speech\u00a0translation.\n\nDiagram detailing how ASR models are trained\n\nOther existing approaches frequently use smaller, more closely paired audio-text training datasets,1 2, 3 or use broad but unsupervised audio pretraining.4, 5, 6\u00a0Because Whisper was trained on a large and diverse dataset and was not fine-tuned to any specific one, it does not beat models that specialize in LibriSpeech performance, a famously competitive benchmark in speech recognition. However, when we measure Whisper\u2019s zero-shot performance across many diverse datasets we find it is much more robust and makes 50% fewer errors than those\u00a0models.\n\nAbout a third of Whisper\u2019s audio dataset is non-English, and it is alternately given the task of transcribing in the original language or translating to English. We find this approach is particularly effective at learning speech to text translation and outperforms the supervised SOTA on CoVoST2 to English translation\u00a0zero-shot.\n\nLoading...\n\nWe hope Whisper\u2019s high accuracy and ease of use will allow developers to add voice interfaces to a much wider set of applications.

It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.\n\n## Approach\n\nApproach\n\nA Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets.\n\n## Setup\n\nWe used Python 3.9.9 and PyTorch 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably OpenAI's tiktoken for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command:\n\n    pip install -U openai-whisper\n\nAlternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies:\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git \n\nTo update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run:\n\n    pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git\n\nIt also requires the command-line tool ffmpeg to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:\n\n    # on Ubuntu or Debian\n    sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg\n\n    # on Arch Linux\n    sudo pacman -S ffmpeg\n\n    # on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)\n    brew install ffmpeg\n\n    # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)\n    choco install ffmpeg\n\n    # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)\n    scoop install ffmpeg\n\nYou may need rust installed as well, in case tiktoken does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the `pip install` command above, please follow the Getting started page to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the `PATH` environment variable, e.g. `export PATH=\"$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH\"`. If the installation fails with `No module named 'setuptools_rust'`, you need to install `setuptools_rust`, e.g. by running:\n\n    pip install setuptools-rust\n\n## Available models and languages\n\nThere are six model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model. The relative speeds below are measured by transcribing English speech on a A100, and the real-world speed may vary significantly depending on many factors including the language, the speaking speed, and the available hardware.\n\nSize Parameters English-only model Multilingual model Required VRAM Relative speed  \ntiny 39 M `tiny.en` `tiny` ~1 GB ~10x  \nbase 74 M `base.en` `base` ~1 GB ~7x  \nsmall 244 M `small.en` `small` ~2 GB ~4x  \nmedium 769 M `medium.en` `medium` ~5 GB ~2x  \nlarge 1550 M N/A `large` ~10 GB 1x  \nturbo 809 M N/A `turbo` ~6 GB ~8x  \n\nThe `.en` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the `tiny.en` and `base.en` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the `small.en` and `medium.en` models. Additionally, the `turbo` model is an optimized version of `large-v3` that offers faster transcription speed with a minimal degradation in accuracy.\n\nWhisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of `large-v3` and `large-v2` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in Italic) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of the paper, as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3.\n\nWER breakdown by language\n\n## Command-line usage\n\nThe following command will transcribe speech in audio files, using the `turbo` model:\n\n    whisper audio.flac audio.mp3 audio.wav --model turbo\n\nThe default setting (which selects the `turbo` model) works well for transcribing English. To transcribe an audio file containing non-English speech, you can specify the language using the `--language` option:\n\n    whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese\n\nAdding `--task translate` will translate the speech into English:\n\n    whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese --task translate\n\nRun the following to view all available options:\n\n    whisper --help\n\nSee tokenizer.py for the list of all available languages.\n\n## Python usage\n\nTranscription can also be performed within Python:\n\n    import whisper\n\n    model = whisper.load_model(\"turbo\")\n    result = model.transcribe(\"audio.mp3\")\n    print(result[\"text\"])\n\nInternally, the `transcribe()` method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window.\n\nBelow is an example usage of `whisper.detect_language()` and `whisper.decode()` which provide lower-level access to the model.\n\n    import whisper\n\n    model = whisper.load_model(\"turbo\")\n\n    # load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds\n    audio = whisper.load_audio(\"audio.mp3\")\n    audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio)\n\n    # make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model\n    mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio, n_mels=model.dims.n_mels).to(model.device)\n\n    # detect the spoken language\n    _, probs = model.detect_language(mel)\n    print(f\"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}\")\n\n    # decode the audio\n    options = whisper.DecodingOptions()\n    result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options)\n\n    # print the recognized text\n    print(result.text)\n\n## More examples\n\nPlease use the  Show and tell category in Discussions for sharing more example usages of Whisper and third-party extensions such as web demos, integrations with other tools, ports for different platforms, etc.\n\n## License\n\nWhisper's code and model weights are released under the MIT License.

At around the 2010s, deep neural network approaches became more common for speech recognition models, which were enabled by the availability of large datasets (\"big data\") and increased computational performance. Early approaches to deep learning in speech recognition included convolutional neural networks, which were limited due to their inability to capture sequential data, which later led to developments of Seq2seq approaches, which include recurrent neural networks which made use of long short-term memory.\n\nTransformers, introduced in 2017 by Google, displaced many prior state-of-the art approaches to many problems in machine learning, and started becoming the core neural architecture in fields such as language modeling and computer vision; weakly-supervised approaches to training acoustic models were recognized in the early 2020s as promising for speech recognition approaches using deep neural networks.\n\nAccording to a NYT report, in 2021 OpenAI believed they exhausted sources of higher-quality data to train their large language models and decided to complement scraped web text with transcriptions of YouTube videos and podcasts, and developed Whisper to solve this task.\n\n- Dong Yu, Li Deng.

OpenAI transcribed over a million hours of YouTube videos to train GPT-4. 2024-04-06.\n\nWhisper (speech recognition system)\n## Training\n\nWhisper has been trained using semi-supervised learning on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask data, of which about one-fifth (117,000 hours) were non-English audio data. After training, it was fine-tuned to suppress the prediction of speaker names.\n\nIt was trained by AdamW optimizer with gradient norm clipping and a linear learning rate decay with warmup,\u00a0with batch size 256 segments. Training proceeds for 1 million updates (2-3 epochs).\u00a0 No data augmentation or regularization, except for the Large V2 model, which used SpecAugment, Stochastic Depth, and BPE Dropout.\u00a0Training used data parallelism with float16, dynamic loss scaling, and activation checkpointing.\n\n## Capacity\n\nWhisper does not outperform models which specialize in the LibriSpeech dataset, although when tested across many datasets, it is more robust and makes 50% fewer errors than other models.Whisper has a differing error rate with respect to transcribing different languages, with a higher word error rate in languages not well-represented in the training data. The authors found that multi-task learning improved overall performance compared to models specialized to one task. They conjectured that the best Whisper model trained is still underfitting the dataset, and larger models and longer training can result in better models.\n\nThird-party evaluations have found varying levels of AI hallucination. A study of transcripts of public meetings found hallucinations in eight out of every 10 transcripts, while an engineer discovered hallucinations in \"about half\" of 100 hours of transcriptions and a developer identified them in \"nearly every one\" of 26,000 transcripts. A study of 13,140 short audio segments (averaging 10 seconds) found 187 hallucinations (1.4%), 38% of which generated text that could be harmful because it inserted false references to things like race, non-existent medications, or violent events that were not in the audio.\n\n- Introducing Whisper. 2022-09-21.\n- Wiggers, Kyle.

Stargate is designed as part of a greater data center project, which could represent an investment of as much as $100 billion by Microsoft.\n\nStargate is reported to be part of a series of AI-related construction projects planned in the next few years by the companies Microsoft and OpenAI. The supercomputers will be constructed in five phases. The fourth phase should consist in a smaller OpenAI supercomputer, planned to launch around 2026. Stargate is the fifth and final phase of the program, and will take five and six years to complete and is slated to launch around 2028.\n\nThe artificial intelligence of Stargate is slated to be contained on millions of special server chips. The supercomputer's data center will be built in the US across 700 acres of land. It has a planned power consumption of 5 gigawatts, for which it could rely on nuclear energy.

In my case, the summary was fine, but researchers cited by ABC News have found that's not always the case with OpenAI's Whisper, which powers a tool many hospitals use - sometimes it just makes things up entirely.\nWhisper is used by a company called Nabla for a medical transcription tool that it estimates has transcribed 7 million medical conversations, according to ABC News. More than 30,000 clinicians and 40 health systems use it, the outlet writes. Nabla is reportedly aware that Whisper can hallucinate, and is \"addressing the problem.\"\nA group of researchers from Cornell University, the University of Washington, and others found in a study that Whisper hallucinated in about 1 percent of transcriptions, making up entire sentences with sometimes violent sentiments or nonsensical phrases during silences in recordings. The researchers, who gathered audio samples from TalkBank's AphasiaBank as part of the study, note silence is particularly common when someone with a language disorder called aphasia is speaking. \nOne of the researchers, Allison Koenecke of Cornell University, posted examples like the one below in a thread about the study.\n\n\nHarms perpetuating violence involve misrepresentation of a speaker's words that could become part of a formal record (e.g. in a courtroom trial); we present 3 subcategories of examples: physical violence, sexual innuendo, and demographic stereotyping (4/14) pic.twitter.com/zhsKxI2qNs- Allison Koenecke (@allisonkoe) June 3, 2024\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers found that hallucinations also included invented medical conditions or phrases you might expect from a YouTube video, such as \"Thank you for watching!\" (OpenAI reportedly used to transcribe over a million hours of YouTube videos to train GPT-4.) \nThe study was presented in June at the Association for Computing Machinery FAccT conference in Brazil. It's not clear if it has been peer-reviewed.\n\nOpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson emailed a statement to The Verge:\nWe take this issue seriously and are continually working to improve, including reducing hallucinations. For Whisper use on our API platform, our usage policies prohibit use in certain high-stakes decision-making contexts, and our model card for open-source use includes recommendations against use in high-risk domains. We thank researchers for sharing their findings.","snippet":"OpenAI's Whisper, a transcription tool used by many hospitals through a company called Nabla, has been found to occasionally generate hallucinations, creating entirely fabricated sentences during transcription.

ChatGPT's new API uses the same GPT-3.5-turbo AI model as the chatbot. This allows developers to add either an unmodified or modified version of ChatGPT to their applications. The ChatGPT API costs $0.001 per 1,000 input tokens plus $0.002 per 1,000 output tokens (about 750 words), making it ~10% the price of the original GPT-3.5 models.\n\nA few days before the launch of OpenAI's software developer support service, on February 27, 2023, Snapchat rolled out, for its paid Snapchat Plus user-base, a custom ChatGPT chatbot called \"My AI\".\n\n- Torres, Jennifer.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that users were unable to see the contents of the conversations. Shortly after the bug was fixed, users could not see their conversation history. Later reports showed the bug was much more severe than initially believed, with OpenAI reporting that it had leaked users' \"first and last name, email address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card expiration date\".\n\n- ChatGPT bug leaked users' conversation histories.

The company initially planned to launch the store in November 2023, but it was delayed. At launch, the GPT Store offered more than 3 million custom chatbots. Chatbots available through the store are developed using OpenAI's GPT Builder system. Development of chatbots on the platform does not require programming skills. Two days after launch, the GPT Store offered many versions of \"virtual girlfriend\" bots, something that is against OpenAI's terms of service.\n\n- Introducing GPTs. 6 November 2023.\n- Metz, Cade.

GPT-4o is twice as fast and costs half as much as GPT-4 Turbo. GPT-4o is free to all users within a usage limit, despite being more capable than the older model GPT-4, which is only available through paid subscriptions. The usage limit is five times higher for ChatGPT Plus subscribers than for free users.\n\nOn July 18, 2024, OpenAI released GPT-4o mini, a smaller version of GPT-4o replacing GPT-3.5 Turbo on the ChatGPT interface. Its API costs $0.15 per million input tokens and $0.60 per million output tokens, compared to $5 and $15 respectively for GPT-4o.\n\n- Field, Hayden.

In December 2024, o1-preview was replaced by o1.\n\no1 is designed to solve more complex problems by spending more time \"thinking\" before it answers, enabling it to analyze its answers and explore different strategies. According to OpenAI, o1-preview outperforms GPT-4o in areas like competitive programming, mathematics, and scientific reasoning. o1-preview ranked in the 89th percentile on Codeforces' competitive programming contests, scored 83% on a International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam (compared to 13% for GPT-4o), and performs similarly to Ph.D. students on benchmarks in physics, biology, and chemistry.\n\n- Franzen, Carl.

In fact, OpenAI has integrated Whisper into its suite of API services, providing endpoints for both transcription and translation of audio files. This means you can send an audio file (in one of the supported formats such as mp3, m4a, wav, etc.) to the Whisper API endpoint (typically at `/v1/audio/transcriptions` for direct transcription or `/v1/audio/translations` to transcribe and translate non\u2011English speech into English) and receive a high\u2011quality transcript in response.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Endpoints and Usage:**  \n  The API accepts audio files (up to 25 MB per request) and returns the transcription result in text. It supports a variety of file formats and even provides an option to translate non\u2011English audio into English.\n\n- **Pricing:**  \n  The Whisper API is priced on a per\u2011minute basis. For example, pricing details (which may change over time) indicate a cost around $0.006 per minute of audio processed. For the most up-to-date pricing and usage limits, you should refer to OpenAI\u2019s [Pricing Page](https://openai.com/pricing) and API documentation.\n\n- **Integration:**  \n  Using the Whisper API is as straightforward as making a standard HTTP request with your audio file. OpenAI\u2019s comprehensive documentation provides code examples (in Python, cURL, etc.) to help you integrate it into your application quickly.\n\n- **Developer Resources:**  \n  OpenAI has released guides and FAQs for the Whisper API that detail how to set up your request, what file formats are supported, and how to handle the response. This makes it very accessible even if you\u2019re building a simple transcription tool without any additional features.\n\n### Example Workflow\n\n1. **Prepare Your Audio File:** Ensure your file is in one of the supported formats and under the size limit.\n2. **Make the API Call:** Submit your file to the transcription endpoint using your API key.\n3. **Receive and Process the Response:** The API will return the transcription in a JSON format, which you can then use in your application.\n\nFor more detailed instructions and code samples, you can check out the official [OpenAI API documentation for Whisper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text) and the related blog post announcing the Whisper API.  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n\ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201\n\nIn summary, if you only need a quality transcript with no extra functionality, using the Whisper API is an excellent option as it provides robust, production-ready speech-to-text capabilities directly through OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201","start_idx":2303,"end_idx":2322,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Speech to text - OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text","attribution":"platform.openai.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The Audio API provides two speech to text endpoints, transcriptions and translations, based on our state-of-the-art open source large-v2 Whisper model."}]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201","start_idx":2325,"end_idx":2344,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Introducing ChatGPT and Whisper APIs - OpenAI","url":"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis/","attribution":"openai.com","pub_date":1713916800.0,"snippet":"ChatGPT and Whisper models are now available on our API, giving developers access to cutting-edge language (not just chat!) and speech-to-text ..."}]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201","start_idx":2347,"end_idx":2366,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Whisper Audio API FAQ - OpenAI Help Center","url":"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7031512-whisper-audio-api-faq","attribution":"help.openai.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OpenAI's Whisper models have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, from transcription services to voice assistants and more."}]}],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"91cdaa7c-162e-47b0-9b96-d8895e370b34","request_id":"90be8e4aaa01ce32-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"91cdaa7c-162e-47b0-9b96-d8895e370b34","children":[]}}}
