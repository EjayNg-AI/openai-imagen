Here\u2019s how you can accomplish both tasks:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Disable Root Login\n\n1. **Open the SSH Configuration File**:\n   - Edit the SSH configuration file using your preferred text editor (e.g., `nano` or `vi`):\n     ```bash\n     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n     ```\n\n2. **Locate the PermitRootLogin Directive**:\n   - Look for the line that says:\n     ```bash\n     #PermitRootLogin yes\n     ```\n\n3. **Edit the PermitRootLogin Directive**:\n   - Change the directive to `no`:\n     ```bash\n     PermitRootLogin no\n     ```\n   - Ensure the line is uncommented (remove the `#` at the beginning if present).\n\n4. **Save and Exit**:\n   - Save and close the file (`Ctrl + X` in nano, then press `Y` to confirm).\n\n5. **Restart the SSH Service**:\n   - Restart SSH to apply changes:\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl restart sshd\n     ```\n\n**Note**: Make sure you have a non-root user with sudo privileges set up before disabling root login; otherwise, you could lock yourself out of your server.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Change Your Password for a User Account\n\n1. **Use the passwd Command**:\n   - Run the following command to change the password for your user account. Replace `username` with your actual username:\n     ```bash\n     sudo passwd username\n     ```\n   - The system will prompt you to enter a new password twice for confirmation.\n\n2. **Password Strength**:\n   - Choose a strong password combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\n---\n\nAfter completing these steps, your server will have improved security with root login disabled, and your user account will have a new password. Make sure to log in with your non-root user account after these changes."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"cfe75cf8-c104-4ad7-aad6-733c93864816","request_id":"8d8076b29e7444c0-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cfe75cf8-c104-4ad7-aad6-733c93864816","children":["aaa206a1-e1e6-4ce3-91fc-5ffc724e6d60"]},"aaa206a1-e1e6-4ce3-91fc-5ffc724e6d60":{"id":"aaa206a1-e1e6-4ce3-91fc-5ffc724e6d60","message":{"id":"aaa206a1-e1e6-4ce3-91fc-5ffc724e6d60","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1729841572.860082,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["how do I determine what, if any, firewall is running?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8d8083e3bb0044c0-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0ebce9e3-1c6d-474a-9334-189bce804052","children":["61bfaa8f-fd74-4227-b795-ed43fda1a6fa"]},"61bfaa8f-fd74-4227-b795-ed43fda1a6fa":{"id":"61bfaa8f-fd74-4227-b795-ed43fda1a6fa","message":{"id":"61bfaa8f-fd74-4227-b795-ed43fda1a6fa","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1729841584.316007,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["To determine if a firewall is running on your CentOS 8 server and to identify which firewall service is active, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Check for firewalld\n\nCentOS 8 typically uses `firewalld` as the default firewall service. To see if `firewalld` is active, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status firewalld\n```\n\n- If it\u2019s running, you\u2019ll see output indicating its active status.\n- If it\u2019s not installed or running, you\u2019ll see a message indicating it\u2019s inactive or that the service is not found.\n\nAlternatively, you can use this command to check if `firewalld` is active:\n\n```bash\nsudo firewall-cmd --state\n```\n\nIf `firewalld` is running, it will output `running`; if it\u2019s inactive, it will output `not running`.\n\n### Step 2: Check for iptables\n\nIf `firewalld` is not installed or active, your system might be using `iptables`. To check the status of `iptables`, you can use:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status iptables\n```\n\nIf `iptables` is active, this will display its running status; if not, it will indicate it is inactive or not found.\n\n### Step 3: Check for nftables (if applicable)\n\nCentOS 8 supports `nftables` as an alternative to `iptables`. To see if `nftables` is active, you can check its status with:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status nftables\n```\n\nIf it\u2019s running, you\u2019ll see output indicating its active status.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Active Firewall Rules\n\nOnce you know which firewall service is active, you can also list the current rules:\n\n- For `firewalld`:\n  ```bash\n  sudo firewall-cmd --list-all\n  ```\n\n- For `iptables`:\n  ```bash\n  sudo iptables -L\n  ```\n\n- For `nftables`:\n  ```bash\n  sudo nft list ruleset\n  ```\n\nThese commands help confirm which firewall rules are currently in effect."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa206a1-e1e6-4ce3-91fc-5ffc724e6d60","request_id":"8d8083e3bb0044c0-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa206a1-e1e6-4ce3-91fc-5ffc724e6d60","children":[]}}}
