Personal-scholarly brand (signals authorship & authority)**  \nBest if you want long-term academic identity and citability.\n- **ejaymath.org** \u2013 clean, serious, pronounceable; ideal for preprints/expositions.\n- **ejaymathematics.org**\n- **ejaymathlab.org** (nicely bridges to your existing \u201cMath Lab\u201d identity)\n- **ejayresearch.org** (broader than math; future-proof)\n\n**B.

Keep accents for links/calls to action only.  \n- **Math rendering:** KaTeX for speed; server-side prerendered SVG for heavyweight articles (consistent line breaks, archival quality).  \n- **Layout:** strong grid, generous margins; narrow reading width (65\u201380 chars); consistent figure/table styling.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Make the first visit compelling (and the 5-minute test)\n\n**Above the fold (home):**\n- One-line promise, two CTAs: **Start Learning** (Singapore levels) and **Explore Research** (graduate notes & expositions).  \n- A \u201cMath this week\u201d strip: **Problem of the Week**, **Article of the Week**, and **Frontier Explainer**.  \n- A mini **knowledge map** (graph of topics) with hover tooltips\u2014invites exploration and makes the site feel alive.\n\n**For newcomers (5 minutes):**\n- Solve a bite-sized problem (with interactive hint/solution).  \n- Skim an expository \u201cWhy this matters\u201d paragraph that links school math to research.  \n- Try a tiny AI demo (e.g., \u201cformalize this statement\u201d with your safety caveats).  \n- See clear paths forward (breadcrumbs + related reading).\n\n**For returners (subsequent visits):**\n- Personalized \u201cContinue where you left off\u201d + saved problems/notes (cookies/local storage; user accounts optional later).\n\n---\n\n## 6) Content standards (what \u201cgood\u201d looks like)\n\n- **Research/expositions:** Start with motivation, give minimal counterexamples, state theorems cleanly, sketch the landscape (who, when, why), finish with \u201cNext steps\u201d and a compact bibliography.
