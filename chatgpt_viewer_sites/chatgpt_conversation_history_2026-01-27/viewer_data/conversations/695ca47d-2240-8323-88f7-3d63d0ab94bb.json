South Africa floats universal basic income for all","snippet":"In the wake of a historic political shift following its loss of a parliamentary majority, South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) is proposing to convert its COVID-era Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant into a universal basic income (UBI) for all adults aged 18 to 59. This move could position South Africa as the first country to introduce a nationwide unconditional basic income. Despite ANC's prior austerity measures, the party and other political groups broadly support maintaining or expanding income support.\n\nThe proposal stems from criticisms of the current SRD system, which is R370 a month\u2014half the food poverty line\u2014and excludes many eligible recipients due to outdated means-testing and technological barriers. Civil society groups like the Institute for Economic Justice (IEJ) and #PayTheGrants argue for broader income support, especially for low-wage workers, citing strong evidence from similar programs in Kenya, Wales, Ireland, and the U.S.\n\nThe ANC and its partners claim that wealth redistribution\u2014through taxes or increased consumption\u2014could sustainably support UBI while boosting economic growth. Advocates see this as a transformative development model to address deep inequality in a nation where the richest 0.1% hold nearly a third of all wealth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1717822836.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"time.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/5252049/finland-to-end-universal-basic-income/","title":"Finland Will End Its Experiment With Universal Basic Income After a Two-Year Trial","snippet":"Finland has announced it will end its two-year universal basic income (UBI) trial in January 2019, rejecting a proposal by its social security agency, Kela, to extend the program. Launched in 2017, the initiative provided 2,000 unemployed citizens with a monthly payment of \u20ac560 ($685) unconditionally, even if recipients found employment. The pilot aimed to test UBI as a solution to high unemployment, which had peaked at 10% in 2015. However, in December 2017, the Finnish parliament introduced a law requiring jobless individuals to work at least 18 hours every three months to continue receiving unemployment benefits, reflecting a shift away from unconditional support. While proponents of UBI argue that it can alleviate social challenges like poverty and unemployment, critics argue that such programs are expensive and may not yield effective results. Other nations, including Canada, Holland, and Kenya, have also tested similar schemes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1524552715.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altmans-big-basic-income-study-is-finally-out","title":"Here's What Happens When You Give People Free Money","snippet":"A decade-long study led by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and conducted by OpenResearch examined the impact of unconditional cash transfers on low-income Americans. From November 2020 to October 2023, 1,000 participants across Illinois and Texas received $1,000 monthly, while 2,000 others received $50 as a control group. The research found that most recipients used the money for essentials like food, housing, healthcare, and transportation. Some also invested in starting businesses or helped others financially. Despite some enhancements in living conditions and personal satisfaction, the study concluded that the $36,000 received over three years did not significantly improve recipients\u2019 long-term financial health or physical well-being. Work participation decreased slightly, with participants prioritizing meaningful or flexible employment over higher income. Although fears of dependency were partly validated by a reduction in total income and increased debt, the research emphasized that recipients valued the time and flexibility the cash enabled.

This is supplemented by $3 million from the Colorado Trust and an anonymous foundation, allowing the initiative to continue for six more months and expand to include 39 new participants. The project, considered the largest of its kind in the U.S. for providing universal basic income to individuals experiencing homelessness, has distributed $6.5 million in no-strings-attached payments to date. Initially, participants received varying payment structures, such as a one-time $6,500 payment followed by $500 monthly for 11 months or $1,000 monthly for a year. In the upcoming phase, payments will be standardized, with two groups receiving $1,000 per month and a control group receiving $100 per month for six months. An interim report from October highlighted positive outcomes, including increased housing stability and fewer people sleeping outside or in shelters, though issues like food insecurity and mental health challenges persisted.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1706102280.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2024/11/05/rejects-funding-universal-basic-income-project","title":"City council votes against funding for Denver Basic Income Project","snippet":"The Denver City Council voted 6-6 on a proposal to allocate $2.5 million to the Denver Basic Income Project (DBIP), effectively rejecting the measure, as a simple majority of seven votes is required for approval. This proposed amendment sought to include funding for DBIP in Mayor Mike Johnston's 2025 budget. The DBIP had previously shown promising results, with nearly half of its participants reportedly securing housing after one year. However, the mayor's administration argued that the program has not significantly improved participants' ability to exit homelessness and preferred to invest in other housing initiatives. The proposed funding represented a small portion of the city's $1.76 billion discretionary spending budget.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1730812680.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/denver-basic-income-reduces-homelessness-food-insecurity-housing-ubi-gbi-2024-6","title":"Denver gave people experiencing homelessness $1,000 a month. A year later, nearly half of participants said they had housing.","snippet":"The Denver Basic Income Project, launched in fall 2022, provided direct cash aid to more than 800 people experiencing homelessness, aiming to assess the impact of basic income on housing stability, financial well-being, and mental health. Participants were divided into three groups: one received $1,000 monthly, another got $6,500 upfront then $500 monthly, and the control group received $50 monthly. After 10 months, around 45% of participants across all groups reported having stable housing\u2014up from the 6\u201312% recorded at the start. However, the outcomes were similar between all groups, indicating that larger payments may not have significantly improved results.\n\nParticipants used the funds to cover essentials like rent, transportation, groceries, and childcare. Many reported greater financial stability, less reliance on emergency aid, and increased full-time employment. However, average stress levels rose, according to Kessler 10 scores. The program reportedly saved the city over $589,000 by reducing use of emergency services, though this is small compared to its $9.4 million cost. While the program had clear short-term benefits for individuals, including more time with family and access to housing, concerns remain about long-term sustainability and lasting effects once payments end. Organizers aim to extend the project and continue evaluating its broader impact.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1720717794.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_695ca4b33dfc832f979e1a93317e62ef","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing for recent UBI research and evaluations","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"f94faa30-0932-4459-a49e-c5af6cba4711","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"e104aadb-b883-4435-a304-2cf4eaf8599f","turn_exchange_id":"03064e10-3871-4054-95f8-12c897f7d3d9"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e104aadb-b883-4435-a304-2cf4eaf8599f","children":["f519a57b-77f9-49a0-9eff-2d3500bd0944"]},"f519a57b-77f9-49a0-9eff-2d3500bd0944":{"id":"f519a57b-77f9-49a0-9eff-2d3500bd0944","message":{"id":"f519a57b-77f9-49a0-9eff-2d3500bd0944","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767679177.808445,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Critical evaluation of UBI research and advances","content":"I need to rigorously examine UBI, defining its dimensions like universal vs targeted, conditional vs unconditional, and more.

Contrary to concerns that recipients might reduce their work efforts, the study found no evidence of decreased employment. Instead, the participants reported improved mental health, financial stability, and food security compared to similar households not in the program. The payments accounted for about one-third of a typical recipient\u2019s annual income and were primarily used for essential expenses like rent and food.\n\nMinneapolis joins other cities, including Denver and Flint, Michigan, which are also piloting similar basic income initiatives.

However, not all responses to GBI programs have been positive\u2014lawmakers in Iowa and Texas are attempting to ban or challenge such initiatives, citing concerns about their legality and impact.

Under the scheme, every resident citizen receives quarterly payments of about $200, intended as a social safety net to reduce living costs and counter population decline. The initiative is funded by a U.S.-backed trust fund compensating for past nuclear testing, worth over $1.3 billion with an additional $500 million pledged by 2027.\n\nThe scheme leverages blockchain technology to distribute funds across the archipelago\u2019s remote islands using a government-backed digital wallet and a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. While only 12 people initially opted for cryptocurrency payments, the digital wallet is seen as a potentially useful tool where banking infrastructure is lacking. Experts highlight internet and mobile access as crucial for broader adoption.\n\nDespite warnings from the IMF about potential risks, such as governance and financial integrity issues, officials and experts view the program as a pioneering model, particularly for small and dispersed island nations.

South Africa floats universal basic income for all","snippet":"In the wake of a historic political shift following its loss of a parliamentary majority, South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) is proposing to convert its COVID-era Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant into a universal basic income (UBI) for all adults aged 18 to 59. This move could position South Africa as the first country to introduce a nationwide unconditional basic income. Despite ANC's prior austerity measures, the party and other political groups broadly support maintaining or expanding income support.\n\nThe proposal stems from criticisms of the current SRD system, which is R370 a month\u2014half the food poverty line\u2014and excludes many eligible recipients due to outdated means-testing and technological barriers. Civil society groups like the Institute for Economic Justice (IEJ) and #PayTheGrants argue for broader income support, especially for low-wage workers, citing strong evidence from similar programs in Kenya, Wales, Ireland, and the U.S.\n\nThe ANC and its partners claim that wealth redistribution\u2014through taxes or increased consumption\u2014could sustainably support UBI while boosting economic growth.

A study found that it could boost the global GDP by 130%.","snippet":"A new study titled \"Utilizing basic income to create a sustainable, poverty-free tomorrow\" proposes implementing a global universal basic income (UBI) funded by carbon taxes. Researchers, including lead author Rashid Sumaila from the University of British Columbia, argue that this strategy could address both environmental issues and social inequality simultaneously. Though the initiative would require a significant upfront investment\u2014estimated at one-third of global GDP\u2014it has the potential to increase global GDP by as much as 130%. The proposed UBI would provide unconditional regular cash payments to all individuals worldwide, contrasting with current limited guaranteed income programs in places like the U.S. The idea, popularized after the economic disruptions of COVID-19, faces political resistance in the U.S. but is gaining traction elsewhere, with South Africa potentially leading global adoption. The funding would stem from taxing polluters, including carbon emitters, overfishers, and plastic polluters, generating trillions annually.

In Kilifi County, women like Claris Pendo and Samini Kazungu have moved away from labor-intensive and hazardous work\u2014such as charcoal burning\u2014to more sustainable livelihoods after receiving unconditional cash support from the NGO GiveDirectly. Pendo, now pregnant with her seventh child, used her funds to buy livestock, while Kazungu used hers for medical care, food, and investing in property and a business.\n\nA study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that such transfers, disbursed between 2014 and 2017, cut infant mortality by 48% and under-five mortality by 45%, rivaling health interventions like vaccines. Women were also able to reduce labor during pregnancy, improve child nutrition, and access better healthcare. Moreover, the local economy benefited, with business revenues increasing and GDP rising by $2.50 for every dollar spent.\n\nThe report advocates for a shift in global aid strategies from traditional, advice-based models to direct monetary support, highlighting the recipients\u2019 ability to make informed decisions that impact their families and communities positively.","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1760000420.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_695ca4b33dfc832f979e1a93317e62ef","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching

Launched in 2018, the initiative involves 20,000 participants across 200 rural villages and has drawn attention from U.S. policymakers exploring anti-poverty solutions. Unlike typical government aid, this program offers unconditional cash transfers to participants. It features three groups: one receiving $22.50 monthly for 12 years, another the same amount for two years, and a third a one-time $500 lump sum. Early findings show improvements in housing, food security, mental health, and business development. Long-term and lump-sum support have been more successful in building wealth and reducing domestic violence compared to short-term assistance. U.S. leaders, including Mayors for a Guaranteed Income founder Michael Tubbs, see Kenya\u2019s model as a potential blueprint, though viability in high-income settings remains uncertain due to cost. The Kenyan program will collect data through 2030 to assess long-term impacts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":16,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1717837922.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_695ca4b33dfc832f979e1a93317e62ef","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for GiveDirectly UBI 2023 long-term results","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"f94faa30-0932-4459-a49e-c5af6cba4711","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"961503ca-7eee-42ff-8499-4d1c892f2e55","turn_exchange_id":"03064e10-3871-4054-95f8-12c897f7d3d9"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"961503ca-7eee-42ff-8499-4d1c892f2e55","children":["d08faa18-9496-4f57-a35e-66bf7e914673"]},"d08faa18-9496-4f57-a35e-66bf7e914673":{"id":"d08faa18-9496-4f57-a35e-66bf7e914673","message":{"id":"d08faa18-9496-4f57-a35e-66bf7e914673","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767679283.963877,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring academic sources on Kenya's UBI","content":"We need to find credible academic sources on the long-term UBI study in Kenya, possibly from Banerjee et al. 2023.

It\u2019s usually about **guaranteed income / guaranteed basic income** pilots (targeted to low-income groups) or \u201cUBI-like\u201d universal dividends (e.g., Alaska). That gap between *the ideal-type policy* and *what gets tested* is one of the central research and interpretation challenges. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view0\ue202turn4view2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## The strongest arguments *for* UBI (and what research can actually test)\n\n### 1) Poverty and volatility reduction (plus dignity)\nUBI\u2019s cleanest promise is **income-floor insurance**: less poverty, less financial volatility, fewer \u201cbenefits cliffs,\u201d and less stigma from means-testing.\n\nResearch can test downstream outcomes (food security, stress, eviction risk, etc.) fairly well; it cannot directly \u201ctest\u201d dignity in a single scalar metric, but qualitative work helps.\n\n### 2) Administrative simplicity (and take-up)\nUBI aims to reduce complex eligibility rules and bureaucratic friction. The Finnish experiment explicitly studied bureaucracy and well-being alongside employment. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view2\ue202turn15view1\ue201\n\n### 3) Bargaining power and labor-market choice\nA predictable cash floor may increase worker bargaining power (e.g., ability to refuse exploitative work, take training, search longer for a better match, start a business). Recent large trials measure this more directly via time-use data, job-search behavior, and entrepreneurship outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn8view1\ue202turn18view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## The hardest critiques (where UBI often collapses in practice)\n\n### 1) The fiscal arithmetic is brutal\nIf you make the benefit large enough to meaningfully live on, the **gross cost** becomes enormous; if you hold spending constant by replacing existing benefits, the resulting UBI is often **too small to lift people out of poverty**.\n\nThe OECD\u2019s classic simulation-style point is that *at current spending levels*, a basic income would often end up **well below the poverty line**, and a meaningful UBI typically implies **substantial new taxation** or major reallocation. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view6\ue202turn3search4\ue201\n\nThis is not a minor detail: **how you finance UBI** (income tax, value-added tax, wealth taxes, carbon taxes, spending cuts) often dominates who wins/loses.\n\n### 2) Opportunity cost: \u201cWhy not target the poor?\u201d\nUniversality gives money to people who don\u2019t need it, then tries to claw it back via taxes. That can be elegant in theory; in practice, it can be politically or administratively messy, and it can be less cost-effective for poverty reduction than targeted transfers at the same budget.\n\n### 3) Labor supply and \u201cmeaningful work\u201d tradeoffs are real\u2014but nuanced\nThe best evidence does **not** support the cartoon fear (\u201cpeople stop working en masse\u201d). But it also does **not** support the equally cartoonish claim (\u201cUBI has no effect on work\u201d).\n\nExample: OpenResearch\u2019s large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in two US states found recipients were **~2 percentage points less likely to be employed** and worked **~1.3 fewer hours/week** on average, while also showing more ability to be selective and align work with goals. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \nFinland\u2019s experiment found **small employment effects overall** with improved perceived well-being. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view1\ue202turn15view2\ue201  \nAlaska\u2019s universal dividend literature finds **mixed general-equilibrium effects** and small net contractions in hours for some subgroups (e.g., women with young children), alongside demand-side effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn19view0\ue201\n\nA serious critique is not \u201cUBI kills work.\u201d It\u2019s: **even modest average reductions may be fiscally and politically costly** if you\u2019re funding UBI via taxes that also affect labor supply, and if your macroeconomy has binding labor shortages.\n\n### 4) Inflation and rent capture: not automatic, but a genuine scaling risk\nAt small scale, \u201cUBI causes inflation\u201d is often overstated. But at large scale\u2014especially in sectors with inelastic supply (housing, healthcare, childcare)\u2014extra cash can be captured by higher prices unless supply expands.\n\nResearch has advanced here: large cash-transfer shocks in rural Kenya showed **minimal price inflation** and sizable positive spillovers, suggesting local supply can respond in some contexts. \ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue202turn14view2\ue201  \nBut you cannot assume those results map cleanly onto high-income housing markets with tight zoning/supply.\n\n---\n\n## What the research evidence says (best-supported findings)\n\n### Employment and labor-market behavior\n- **Average work reductions are usually modest**, but not always zero; composition changes (wage work \u2192 self-employment, schooling, caregiving) are common. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn18view0\ue201  \n- Large Kenyan UBI experimental evidence finds **no overall labor supply change**, but a **shift away from wage employment toward self-employment**, plus local economic expansion. \ue200cite\ue202turn18view0\ue201\n\n### Mental health and subjective well-being\n- A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis of guaranteed basic income-style interventions in high-income countries found **reduced mental distress** (pooled **standardized mean difference (SMD)** about **0.25 standard deviations lower**) and improvements in life satisfaction in several studies\u2014while also noting major heterogeneity and measurement limitations. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view1\ue202turn4view2\ue201  \n- Finland reported better self-reported well-being and less mental strain among recipients. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view1\ue201  \n- OpenResearch found improvements in stress and mental distress early that **faded by year two** (important for claims about persistent psychological transformation). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view1\ue201\n\n### Spending, balance sheets, and \u201cwhat people do with the money\u201d\n- OpenResearch/NBER results: the transfer **increased measured household expenditures by at least ~$300/month**, with larger increases in essentials like housing and food. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n- A critical nuance: improved month-to-month stability does not automatically translate into large long-run wealth gains; longer-run persistence is still debated, with evidence of possible fade-out in some contexts. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\n### Health and children\n- OpenResearch found increased healthcare utilization (hospital/ED/dental/specialist) but **no measurable physical health improvements** on the study\u2019s horizon, and mixed/waning mental-health effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view1\ue201  \n- Separate large-scale Kenya cash-transfer work finds very large short-run child survival effects in that setting (infant and under-5 mortality reductions), alongside mechanisms like increased facility births\u2014this is \u201cUBI-adjacent\u201d but extremely important for the broader unconditional cash literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn14view1\ue201  \n- Baby\u2019s First Years-style evidence (US newborn families) shows **moderate income increases and poverty reductions**, but limited or mixed effects on some hardship and parental well-being measures at the studied transfer size. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Key advances in UBI research (what has genuinely improved in the last ~5\u201310 years)\n\n### 1) Bigger, cleaner experiments with richer measurement\n- The field moved from \u201csmall pilots + surveys\u201d to large RCTs that link surveys with administrative/behavioral measures, time-use, and longer follow-up (e.g., OpenResearch\u2019s multi-year US study). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn8view1\ue201\n\n### 2) \u201cGeneral equilibrium\u201d evidence: spillovers and prices, not just recipients\nOlder studies often measured only recipient outcomes. Newer work experimentally quantifies community-wide spillovers and local price responses (Kenya: large positive spillovers, minimal inflation, local multipliers around 2.4\u20132.5). \ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue202turn14view2\ue201\n\n### 3) Design comparisons: stream vs lump sum, duration, expectations\nKenya\u2019s long-term experiment explicitly compares:\n- long-duration monthly payments,\n- short-duration monthly payments,\n- lump sums of similar delivered value,\nand finds meaningful differences consistent with investment constraints and expectations. \ue200cite\ue202turn18view0\ue201\n\n### 4) Evidence synthesis is getting more disciplined\nSystematic reviews/meta-analyses now more clearly separate *what was actually tested* (often targeted/partial) from \u201ctrue UBI,\u201d and quantify mental health/well-being effects while flagging gaps (e.g., poverty measurement inconsistency, outcome heterogeneity). \ue200cite\ue202turn9view1\ue202turn4view2\ue201\n\n### 5) Modeling is becoming more transparent about assumptions\nBecause no rich country has implemented a full-scale UBI at meaningful levels, researchers increasingly use **microsimulation** and macro models\u2014and are explicit that results can flip sign depending on labor supply and financing assumptions. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view0\ue202turn4view6\ue202turn15view3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Where the frontier still is (the questions research has not \u201csettled\u201d)\n\n1. **National-scale macro effects**: wages, prices (especially housing), and labor demand under real financing choices.  \n2. **Political equilibrium**: whether UBI crowds out more targeted welfare or becomes a \u201cthin universalism\u201d that\u2019s too small to matter.  \n3. **Long-run dynamics**: skill acquisition, entrepreneurship survival rates, intergenerational mobility, and whether benefits persist after transfers end.  \n4. **Complementarities**: cash vs cash + services (housing supply, healthcare access, childcare availability). Cash can\u2019t purchase what the economy doesn\u2019t supply.\n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent UBI-related developments and reporting\ue202turn3news46,turn0news47,turn3news48,turn1news41,turn1news42\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn15view0\ue202turn4view2\ue201","start_idx":852,"end_idx":881,"safe_urls":["https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1004358&type=printable","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11180702/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1004358&type=printable))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Short-term impacts of Universal Basic Income on population mental health inequalities in the UK: A microsimulation modelling study","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1004358&type=printable","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"\n            Effects of guaranteed basic income interventions on poverty\u2010related outcomes in high\u2010income countries: A systematic review and meta\u2010analysis -
