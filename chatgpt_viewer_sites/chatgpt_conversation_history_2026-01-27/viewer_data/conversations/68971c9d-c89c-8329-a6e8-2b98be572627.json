I\u2019m prioritising books that physicists and mathematically minded theorists actually use, with enough depth to be useful in GR/QFT rather than just \u201cPDE 101\u201d.\n\n# Core PDE and analysis you will really use\nAs a base, Evans\u2019 *Partial Differential Equations* is still the fastest way to get fluent with weak solutions, energy methods, and the standard estimates; read it briskly for vocabulary and technique. Pair it with Brezis\u2019 *Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and PDEs* for the functional-analytic backbone you\u2019ll repeatedly need (Lax\u2013Milgram, spectral theory, variational methods). For sharper Sobolev technology, either Adams\u2013Fournier\u2019s *Sobolev Spaces* or Leoni\u2019s *A First Course in Sobolev Spaces* will prevent many false steps later. If you like a more classical linear PDE treatment, Folland\u2019s *Introduction to PDE* and Fritz John\u2019s *PDE* give clean model problems and estimates that transfer well to physics.\n\n# Microlocal analysis, pseudodifferential operators, and semiclassics (indispensable in QFT/scattering)\nFor serious field theory and scattering, the Taylor trilogy (*PDE I\u2013III*) is the most usable doorway into pseudodifferential/Fourier integral operators while keeping the physics-adjacent examples visible. H\u00f6rmander\u2019s four-volume *Analysis of Linear PDOs* is the definitive reference (wavefront sets, propagation of singularities), and you will consult it even if you don\u2019t read it linearly. To work semiclassically\u2014WKB, tunnelling, resonances\u2014Zworski\u2019s *Semiclassical Analysis* is the standard. For actual resonance/scattering machinery, Dyatlov\u2013Zworski\u2019s *Mathematical Theory of Scattering Resonances*, Melrose\u2019s *Geometric Scattering Theory*, and Treves\u2019 two volumes on \u03a8DOs/FIOs are the natural next steps. These tools underlie modern statements like the microlocal spectrum condition in algebraic QFT and the analysis of quantum fields on curved backgrounds.\n\n# Hyperbolic and dispersive equations (wave/Klein\u2013Gordon/Dirac)\nFor nonlinear waves that mirror GR and classical field theories, Sogge\u2019s *Lectures on Nonlinear Wave Equations* plus his *Fourier Integrals in Classical Analysis* give the Strichartz/oscillatory-integral toolkit. For conservation laws and shocks (useful for relativistic fluids and kinetic\u2013fluid limits), Lax\u2019s *Hyperbolic Systems of Conservation Laws* and Bressan\u2019s *Hyperbolic Systems of Conservation Laws* are focused and practical. For dispersive models closer to NLS/KG seen in QFT approximations, Tao\u2019s *Nonlinear Dispersive Equations* and Cazenave\u2019s *Semilinear Schr\u00f6dinger Equations* cover modern techniques (concentration compactness, critical regularity).\n\n# Elliptic/parabolic regularity and geometric PDE\nWhenever gauge theory or GR reduces to elliptic problems, you need hard regularity: Gilbarg\u2013Trudinger\u2019s *Elliptic PDE of Second Order* is the working horse; Ladyzhenskaya\u2013Ural\u2019tseva\u2019s *Linear and Quasilinear Elliptic Equations* deepens a priori estimates. For geometric/fully nonlinear phenomena and free boundaries (mean curvature/Ricci flow and phase boundaries), see Caffarelli\u2013Cabr\u00e9\u2019s *Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Equations* and Caffarelli\u2013Salsa\u2019s *A Geometric Approach to Free Boundary Problems*. On manifolds, Jost\u2019s *Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis* integrates PDE with curvature, harmonic maps, and flows; Grigor\u2019yan\u2019s *Heat Kernel and Analysis on Manifolds*, Chavel\u2019s *Eigenvalues in Riemannian Geometry*, and Berline\u2013Getzler\u2013Vergne\u2019s *Heat Kernels and Dirac Operators* connect spectral geometry to quantum/statistical field theory.\n\n# PDE on curved spacetimes and General Relativity\nFor the PDE formulation of Einstein\u2019s equations and hyperbolic theory on Lorentzian manifolds, Choquet-Bruhat\u2019s *General Relativity and the Einstein Equations* is the canonical treatment. Friedlander\u2019s *The Wave Equation on a Curved Space-Time* remains the classic for propagation and radiation fields. For global existence and stability, Christodoulou\u2013Klainerman\u2019s *The Global Nonlinear Stability of the Minkowski Space*, Ringstr\u00f6m\u2019s *The Cauchy Problem in General Relativity*, and Klainerman\u2013Nicolo\u2019s *The Evolution Problem in GR* are the core monographs. If you want a mathematically clean bridge to quantization on curved backgrounds, B\u00e4r\u2013Ginoux\u2013Pf\u00e4ffle\u2019s *Wave Equations on Lorentzian Manifolds and Quantization* situates PDE methods inside the algebraic/QFT framework.\n\n# Spectral theory and scattering for quantum mechanics/field theory\nReed\u2013Simon *Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics* I\u2013IV is still the standard: self-adjointness, Schr\u00f6dinger operators, spectral/Scattering theory, and operator methods you need for quantum Hamiltonians. For relativistic equations, Thaller\u2019s *The Dirac Equation* gives PDE and spectral analysis of Dirac operators with external fields. For inverse/forward scattering in electromagnetics/acoustics relevant to real-world models, Colton\u2013Kress\u2019s *Inverse Acoustic and Electromagnetic Scattering Theory* is pragmatic.\n\n# Gauge theory and geometric PDE in QFT\nFor the elliptic PDE of Yang\u2013Mills/Seiberg\u2013Witten, Donaldson\u2013Kronheimer\u2019s *The Geometry of Four-Manifolds* and Freed\u2013Uhlenbeck\u2019s *Instantons and Four-Manifolds* are the core analytic sources (elliptic complexes, compactness, bubbling). Parker\u2013Taubes\u2019 *Gauge Theories in Riemannian Geometry* and Morgan\u2019s *The Seiberg\u2013Witten Equations and Applications* round out techniques you\u2019ll reuse: Uhlenbeck compactness, Coulomb gauges, removable singularities, and monotonicity formulas.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a minimal \u201cgets-you-working\u201d pathway for GR: read Evans (fast) + Brezis, then Taylor I\u2013II for \u03a8DO/microlocal, then Sogge for nonlinear waves, and move directly into Choquet-Bruhat and one stability monograph (Christodoulou\u2013Klainerman or Ringstr\u00f6m). For a QFT/scattering-heavy path: Evans/Brezis \u2192 Taylor I\u2013III \u2192 Zworski (Semiclassics) \u2192 Dyatlov\u2013Zworski/Melrose for resonances and geometric scattering, with Reed\u2013Simon running in parallel; add H\u00f6rmander as your reference throughout. If gauge theory is on your horizon, splice in Gilbarg\u2013Trudinger early and then Donaldson\u2013Kronheimer/Freed\u2013Uhlenbeck.\n\nTell me which direction you want to bias (curved-spacetime hyperbolic PDE vs. microlocal/semiclassical QFT vs. gauge-theoretic elliptic analysis), and I\u2019ll convert this into a semester-by-semester plan with problem sets keyed to each book."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"96c66a7e0e035fb4-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"409f93d8-dde4-4db7-98a7-07daf23738cd","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"409f93d8-dde4-4db7-98a7-07daf23738cd","children":[]}}}
