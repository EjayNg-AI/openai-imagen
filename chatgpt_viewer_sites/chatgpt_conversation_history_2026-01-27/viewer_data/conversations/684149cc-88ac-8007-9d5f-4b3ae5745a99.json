This will be the final main lecture in my post-labor economics series. Of course, there will be updates later on and supplementary material as the framework develops and everything comes together. However, let's jump right in today. This is \"Bridging the Gap,\" or \"How Do We Get There From Here,\" or \"From Here to There,\" however you want to say it. So, the biggest question on everyone's mind is, \"Okay, great, you know, you've convinced us that we have to switch to a property-based future because wages are going away and we don't want to rely on government transfers. So, what are we trying to build?\" After doing a little bit of workshopping and looking at all the feedback, I put together a very simple graphic about kind of where your composite household income is going to come from.\r\n\r\n### The Post-Labor Income Pyramid\r\n\r\nAt the very base, now this is interesting because don't let the size necessarily show or indicate how much it could go this way, but it's more like the foundation.\r\n\r\n**Universal Basic Income (UBI)**\r\nThe foundation would be Universal Basic Income, which is a combination of state, federal, possibly municipal. There are some cities trialing UBI. Not every city or county is going to be able to afford that; only the richer counties and cities will be able to afford that. There are also talks about a global UBI, which I'm going to investigate in a future video. I personally right now don't think that a global UBI is possible. It might not even be desirable, but I'm going to give it a fair shake and see what I come up with. Anyways, at the very minimum, we could have a state and federal Universal Basic Income ranging from a couple hundred a month to a couple thousand dollars a month.\r\n\r\n**Public Wealth Fund Dividends**\r\nAbove that, after implementing UBI, because that's the easiest to implement, it's the quickest. We've already done stimulus checks, we know how to do it. Next would be public wealth fund dividends. So this is a dividend-based future. This would be done at the municipal, state, and federal level. And by the way, there are plenty of places that already do this. There are trusts, there are royalties, there are mineral rights. So the Alaska Permanent Fund is one of the biggest, most successful ones. It only pays the equivalent of a couple hundred dollars a month though. However, it adds up, particularly when you have multiple sources of these kinds of incomes. So, municipal, state, federal. At the federal level, you can do stuff like spectrum auctions. At the state level, you can do mineral rights and right-of-way. And at the municipal level, you can do things like solar farms and that sort of thing. So these would be goods that are owned by the state, so this is technically by definition socialism. But as you can see, we're not trying to rely entirely on socialism. And also, we're not inventing the wheel; we're not saying to put all assets under the government. This is just a few assets that make sense to manage under government resources. There are hundreds of examples out there of cities, counties, states, and federal governments running wealth funds of various kinds, whether they're funds, trusts, endowments, those sorts of things.\r\n\r\n**Collectively Owned Private Assets**\r\nNext, above that, is collectively owned private assets. So this would be like your credit union stuff that goes through cooperatives, through banks. It could also be DAOs. I know a lot of people have said, \"What about cryptocurrency?\" What I'm going to say is Bitcoin does not fix this alone; Bitcoin is a currency. And DAOs alone may or may not fix this. But the point is that this is where privately held assets that are collectively owned, whether it's through your bank, through a DAO, or whatever, I don't really care, but that comes at this level. And so the difference is, these two are the only ones run by the state. This one needs to be enabled by the state through regulatory overhaul, basically allowing DAOs to be a legal entity, that sort of thing. Because one of the biggest problems is, some people, the whole ethos behind DAOs and stuff, is like, \"Just get rid of the government.\" But without legal enforcement, adoption is going to be low. It's that simple.\r\n\r\n**Personally Accumulated Assets**\r\nNext is personally accumulated assets. So this is stocks, bonds, rental properties, those sorts of things. This doesn't really change.\r\n\r\n**Residual Wages**\r\nAnd then finally is residual wages. Residual wages: in the long run, people will probably still find some work. Some people will be out of work entirely, but many people will still find gig work and those sorts of things. For example, if you're an influencer or something and you get some ad revenue, technically, if it's a channel you own, that would be a personal asset, but you're still putting work in. My YouTube channel is not passive income; I actually have to actively put work in. So it's technically a business, technically work, you know, whatever. Anyways, this is the pyramid of post-labor economics, of what we're building.\r\n\r\n### Projected Income Evolution\r\n\r\nSo you might say, \"Okay, what's that actually look like?\" This one's a little bit bunched up, but let's just say in 2029, after the next presidential election, we implement a UBI. It's a $300 a month, right off the bat, UBI. So this is what it might look like. If you've got a job that pays about $30,000 a year, this is like minimum, right? That's still like poverty wages right now. So let's just assume that someone in the year 2029 is starting with $30,000 a year, and they have some UBI, and then two very narrow slices of a public wealth fund and collectively owned private assets that they've got some investments in, and then maybe some personally accumulated assets paying a couple hundred a month, whether that is a rental property or something like that. Obviously, if you're only making $30,000 a year, you probably haven't invested in rental properties, but just for the sake of argument, this is how your income sources might look on day one.\r\n\r\nNow, about five or six years later, this is how we might expect it to look, how we might want it to look. So in this case, we've assumed that UBI might go up to $1,000 a month. Your wages will continue to go down, so they're down to $20,000, or sorry, yeah, $20,000 a year, $12,000 a year. But then public wealth fund dividends will have started rising because all the various wealth trusts and endowment funds have been growing. You'll also have had more time to invest in collectively owned private assets and personally accumulated assets. So again, just a completely hypothetical portfolio.\r\n\r\nAnd then finally, by the time we get to 2040, we might expect UBI to be in the range of about $3,000 a month. Now again, this could be a combination of municipal, state, and federal. So $3,000 a month, which would total $36,000 a year; public wealth fund dividends up to $25,000 a year; collectively owned private assets $15,000 a year; personally accumulated assets $15,000 a year; and then maybe a little bit of work left. What you'll notice is that this portfolio gets you up to almost $100,000 a year, whereas before it was $41,000, and before that it was $37,000. So we've got a lot of work to do to do this. However, this is not outside the realm of possibilities.\r\n\r\n### How We Get There: Historical Precedent\r\n\r\nAll right, so now that you've seen the data, let's talk about the actual, \"Okay, what happens? How do we get there?\" and so on and so forth. First and foremost is the history of crisis, crash, and reform. I missed the \"R\" there; it's supposed to be crisis, crash, reform, or crisis, maybe it's cash reform. Anyways, big unemployment shocks follow a repeatable arc: panic, cash relief, then a lasting social program. Inside of about 18 months, the 1935, 1958, and 2009 crises show that once joblessness tops 10%, Congress locks in a durable transfer.\r\n\r\nDurable transfer is just like some kind of structural change. So, in 1935, depression-era unemployment shot up to over 20%. Granted, it was only at 24% for a month or two, but it still stayed above 14% for almost two full years, I believe, and it was above 10% for much longer than that. So it moved from emergency relief to a new Social Security program within 18 months. Basically, once unemployment gets that high, there's enough political willpower and motivation to say, \"Hey, we need a structural change.\"\r\n\r\nNext is the 1958 post-war recession, which pushed joblessness past 10%, spurred the Extended Unemployment Insurance Act, and soon after, the Area Redevelopment Act. So again, once things get painful, Congress acts, and the threshold seems to be about 10%, 10 to 14%. As long as it gets there and stays there for any length of time, you see structural changes. We even saw that with the pandemic, where very early in the pandemic, unemployment spiked well above 14%, and that's when we got the stimulus checks. So, for post-labor economics to be implemented, the long story short is, we don't need to see 20% unemployment or 50% unemployment. Congress will sit up and start taking notice once we hit 10% or 14% for any length of time.\r\n\r\nNow, if we're right, then we're going to see that number creep up, as well as we're going to see other numbers creep down, such as total labor force participation rate, the number of NEETs, and those sorts of things. And as some of you have pointed out in the comments, we've even changed the way that we measure unemployment, I think it was in the '80s or '90s. And so the true unemployment rate, which there's plenty of people talking about how to measure the true unemployment rate, because that doesn't account for underemployment. When you add in underemployment and loosely attached workers, the current unemployment rate is like 15% or something like that; it's probably higher than that by now. Anyways, the point being though is that once things get painful enough, Congress will act. There is a durable history that Congress will act. And so the first thing is a cash transfer, which would be UBI, as long as it stays there. And when I say \"stays there,\" what I mean is as long as unemployment stays that high.\r\n\r\n### The Policy Response Ladder\r\n\r\nPolicymakers climb a familiar three-rung ladder: monetary, fiscal, then structural, as each lower rung exhausts its punch. Each stage buys only enough time for the next until durable asset-based transfers become unavoidable.\r\n\r\nThe first step is monetary: the Fed cuts rates to zero and launches quantitative easing, but the boost fades quickly, certainly not sustainable to do that for a long time. Next up is fiscal: one-off stimulus checks revive demand once or twice before losing potency. You end up with problems like who's going to fund it, inflation, that sort of thing. And then structural: permanent asset-based income\u2014there we go, sorry, I'm stuttering a lot today\u2014dividends, UBI, anchors long-run stability when cash tools stall. So this is basically how we would anticipate it to go, to play out in the future. Each rung's limits force escalation upwards, turning short fixes into broader reforms. Pain equals willpower, or pain transitions into willpower. History shows that as economic strain deepens, Congress reliably climbs the ladder towards lasting programs.\r\n\r\n### The Starter UBI Jolt\r\n\r\nThe starter UBI jolt: this is kind of the number that I've settled on. A modest $300 monthly check to every US adult delivers a macro shot of demand while the deeper dividend ramps up. The math is simply powerful enough to smooth spending shocks without replacing wages. We've got 250 million adults in America. Universal reach keeps the administration friction near zero; we've already proven that we can do that with the stimulus checks. $300 per adult is small enough for bipartisan support, yet large enough to matter. $300 a month would make a really big difference in a lot of people. Now, I've been thinking about this, and I actually think that we should probably start sooner with maybe a $50 a month UBI. And you might say, \"Well, Dave, $50 a month doesn't pay rent.\" But you know what? That can ensure that your kids eat, right? Looking forward to that every month, it's like, \"Hey, there's a nice little shot in the arm that'll help.\" So, $75 billion a month, roughly $900 billion annually, or about 3% of current GDP. That's not huge, right? I mean, that is a big price tag, but that's not the biggest thing in the world, particularly for here in America. But then cash hits wallets fast, nudging aggregate consumption upward, funded by automation taxes, which is a haircut off the top for corporations.\r\n\r\nNow, one of the things that people have talked about is inflation as a big risk. What you need to realize though is that massive job loss is deflationary. Automation and technology are deflationary. So, in fact, in order to maintain inflation, we might actually need UBI to jack up inflation rates. That's going to sound really crazy to some people, and we haven't modeled this yet, but we do know from past experience that technology is deflationary. We also know that job loss is deflationary; if people have less money, then they spend less, and prices go down because demand goes down. So I ultimately suspect that because the current market orthodoxy from the Federal Reserve is that they're trying to control inflation rates above all else, they'll say, \"Hey, if we start to tip into a deflationary economy, they're going to panic and say, 'What do we do? We can't lower interest rates any further.'\" I mean, I guess you could put it negative, but it's like, \"Well, instead of doing that, what if we just inject the money directly into people's wallets?\" So this is a bridge, not an endpoint. Wages will still dominate income today. The starter UBI steadies the economy until structural dividends scale. It's also a way to launch a test bed; that's kind of one of the reasons why I would recommend starting so low.\r\n\r\n### Bootstrapping Local Funds\r\n\r\nAll right, so next up is bootstrapping those local funds. Counties and states can seed future dividends before Congress acts by converting untapped corporate equity and public assets into perpetual income streams. Two simple mechanisms to turn idle wealth into citizen stakes without new debt. This is one of the biggest things: if you're going to bootstrap all this with more debt, that's not necessarily sustainable.\r\n\r\nSo, **share grant tax credit**: firms get a 15% state tax\u2014these are just proposals, by the way\u2014firms get a 15% state credit for donating company stock to a county trust, aligning profit motives with local resilience. Basically, as long as the company is operating locally and invests locally by giving some of their shares, they get a tax break, incentivizing the behavior that you want to see.\r\n\r\n**Dormant asset leasing**: license bandwidth, carbon sinks, or land value leases instead of selling outright, preserving upside for the community. One of the problems when you sell land, like state land, directly to developers is the incentives for the developers are to make as much money as fast as possible and then leave, which, you know, that works somewhat. But if you want to actually capture those rents and distribute them to the people, then this is another opportunity.\r\n\r\n**County dividend seeds**: trust returns begin small per capita payouts, testing post-labor income at pilot scale. So basically, and by the way, there are counties and cities already doing royalty trusts and land trusts and those sorts of things. We're not reinventing the wheel here; all of these exist.\r\n\r\nNext is **coalition building**: early beneficiaries, residents, and donor firms become vocal allies for broader structural reform. Again, this already exists; we're just trying to codify it and formalize it. And then you end up with a **copy-paste template**: any locality with taxable firms or natural assets can stand up a fund, spreading the bridge model nationwide. This is why I keep recommending we start at the municipal level, cities and counties, because, one, a lot of cities and counties are already doing this, a lot of states are already doing this, but once you figure out what works, then you can scale it up.\r\n\r\n### Timeline for Implementation\r\n\r\nNext is the timeline. So basically, the 2025 to 2035 ramp-up. The bridge unfolds in three sequential phases, each triggered by the dashboard gauges and paced to the AI automation curve. So the dashboard gauges are like the economic agency index and some of the other data that we're working on. Accelerating agentic AI by 2028, followed by humanoid robots a few years later, means early pilots must start soon. Basically, we have agents today, but they're basically kind of like the iPhone moment. So it's going to take a couple years for them to really ramp up, even as they get smarter and cheaper and better, because basically they haven't hit product-market fit yet. They exist, they work, but they're not good enough, and they're not cheap enough, and they're not reliable enough yet for wide-scale adoption. So we're projecting that AI agents are really going to take off mainstream in 2028. That could be entirely too conservative. I know that there's a lot of people saying, \"Dave, they're taking off next year,\" and I would not be surprised if they take off in a big way next year.\r\n\r\nAnyways, **Phase One, 2025 to 2028**: launch county wealth fund pilots and enforce short-week job-share dampers to cushion initial displacement. I personally don't think that shortening work weeks and job sharing really solves the problem, because that just means that people are competing over a smaller bucket of work. It's basically musical chairs for work, which, you know, that might be an emergency thing. But I think that companies would really dramatically resist this because of the HR overhead of having multiple employees. But I wanted to include it just because some people have suggested that as a possibility.\r\n\r\nNext is **Phase Two, 2029 to 2032**: hybrid income era. Shrinking wages pair with a $300 to $600 dividend as unemployment and hours worked remain on alert, or sinking.\r\n\r\nAnd then **2033 to 2035**: mature dividend tops 50% of median consumption, letting work become optional for basic needs. This is extremely aggressive, but it might need to be that aggressive. You might say, \"You know, 2035 is a decade from now, Dave, it's all going to be over and done with a decade from now.\" And I'm certainly on board with those numbers. I think that the robotic ramp-up is going to be closer to 2040 to 2050 before we end up with a billion robots. But at the same time, even if there are humans competing over less and less manual labor to do, you're still going to see wages collapse there, because if you end up with twice as many skilled laborers with the same amount of work, and they're competing for work from robots, they're still not going to be doing that well. Plus, AI agents are basically infinitely scalable. So there's going to be some checkpoint metrics that we can watch: U3\u2014I think that's underemployment, or maybe that's just plain unemployment\u2014hours worked dropping year-over-year, wage-profit divergence persists. So basically, as we see more evidence that automation is taking over. TL;DR.\r\n\r\n### Stakeholder Game Plan\r\n\r\nNext is the stakeholder game plan. So this is basically what each of the main pillars do. Each quadrant\u2014households, firms, banks, and government\u2014those are kind of the four primary stakeholders of this table of the economy. Each brings a unique lever to fortify the post-labor bridge. Once cheap money and checks run dry, aligning their incentives turns stop-gap tools into self-reinforcing transition.\r\n\r\nFirst, **households**: enroll in county wealth funds and advocate for trigger-based UBI to anchor political momentum. This is basically going to be automatic, even if people don't know about post-labor economics. The fact that jobs are drying up and wages are going down means that people are going to vote with their wallets, and/or vote based on their wallets, which is basically going to say... I'm predicting that the 2028 presidential election is primarily going to be about unemployment and AI, and the cultural and economic effects of that. So look for that as the main inflection point.\r\n\r\nNext is **firms**. So \"firms\" is the economic term for companies and corporations. Donate equity for tax credits, pilot four-day rotations, and pre-commit to dividend pay-ins from automation gains. Now, there are some people out there\u2014one example is the windfall clause folks\u2014that are saying that we should ask companies to just voluntarily give up a lot of their gains. I don't think that's going to happen. However, if we create tax policies and other incentives that mean that they actually benefit from those qualified ownership donations that we've been talking about, then there's not really necessarily a reason that they won't, other than perhaps skepticism. But at the same time, if you give companies an option to avoid taxes by donating dividend-paying shares, why not?\r\n\r\nNext is **banks**. Banks, and so this is the big commercial banks, but it's also your local credit union. Underwrite dividend-backed consumer credit and package wealth fund shares as low-risk assets for institutional buyers. Basically, your bank becomes a touchpoint for a lot of these products, and it can also become completely automatic too.\r\n\r\nNext is **government**: legislate the trigger dashboard, authorize tax incentive share grants, and mandate pace-matching hour caps when alerts fire. These are all hypothetical ideas of basically implementing a series of triage stop-gap measures. But ultimately, the government will help with implementing UBI and greasing the wheels for all of these other things, allowing banks and firms and households to participate in a post-labor economic paradigm.\r\n\r\n### The Final Income Portfolio\r\n\r\nThe final income portfolio: the post-labor household draws from a balance of three sources\u2014modest remaining wages, dominant property dividends, and a steady transfer floor. Next is diversifying dividend rails across banks, local funds, and federal schemes spreads risk and invites individual choice. This is one of the primary things: individual choice must be maintained for the sake of, number one, economic agency. If you're entirely dependent on what the government says you can and cannot buy, that is authoritarianism, that is communism, plain and simple. That's not what we're aiming for.\r\n\r\nSo, **residual wages**: 20%. And this number didn't come from nowhere. 20% residual wages is based on looking at the mix of jobs and current income that seems like it's probably robust against automation. It could be wrong; it could be lower than that. But this is also going to be aggregate. So some people are still going to make plenty of money from wages, some people are going to make zero. Attention economy, high liability, and licensed roles persist, but most routine blue, white, and pink-collar jobs fade.\r\n\r\n**Property income**: 60%. Trust fund share-based dividends supply the bulk of everyday spending power.\r\n\r\n**Government transfers**: traditional safety net programs continue with only minor expansion, keeping a universal floor. So this is basically rolling unemployment insurance, Social Security, and UBI all into one, is kind of the idea there. Now, when you look at some nations like Germany, Germany has government transfers closer to 30%, 25 to 30%. So we might drift up to about that. And then maybe you split the difference between residual wages and property income, depending on... Now, obviously, here in America, we're pretty phobic of government transfers, so people are going to want to try and keep it around where it is today. Oh, sorry, that's not the end.\r\n\r\n### Failure Modes to Avoid\r\n\r\nFailure modes to avoid: this is the last slide. Even the best-built bridge can crack if politics, markets, or timing go sideways. These five risk channels explain how the transition could stall or even reverse, and why each must be monitored from day one.\r\n\r\nNumber one is **rapid automation surge**: AI and robotics may scale faster than adaptation pathways, leaving households with an income gap to fill in the time. So this is kind of one of the things that a lot of people are worried about. I think that Hofstadter's Law will apply here, and what I mean by that is that even though AI is capable of dislocating far more jobs today, simply just the lag time of implementation and the skepticism of businesses and the skepticism of governments and everything else, that's going to be the slowest bottleneck.\r\n\r\nNext is **elite wealth capture**: this is something that a lot of people are really worried about out there in the comments. Regulatory or corporate pushback could corral new rents at the top, starving dividends even as consumer demand collapses. Now, I'll go back to the pyramid and show, and we can talk through this one at a time, to show where, by dividing it into that pyramid, you can actually prevent elite wealth capture at each level.\r\n\r\nNext is **policy paralysis**: government inaction or status quo clinging, often driven by partisan gridlock, can freeze trigger responses and strand workers. However, again, historically speaking, it looks like once unemployment gets powerful enough, Congress shuts up and acts. Not necessarily always in the best way, but that's when gridlock and logjams break.\r\n\r\n**Slow-boiled complacency**: gradual, invisible displacement lulls society into believing the market will adjust, repeating two decades of wage stagnation. By the way, as I'm doing research for these books, it's not just two decades of wage stagnation; it's actually been seven decades of automation eroding wages. I've got the receipts, and you'll see it in the book once it comes out.\r\n\r\nNext is **demagogic backlash**: voter panic may empower leaders who promise to bring jobs back, derailing structural fixes with nostalgic but impossible pledges.\r\n\r\nSo, let's go through each of these in the pyramid one at a time, just as we wrap up and talk about how structurally each one can be reinforced and avoid elite capture.\r\n\r\nSo, first and foremost, **Universal Basic Income**, state and federal. As we saw with the stimulus checks, there was far less corruption there than there was in the Paycheck Protection Program. So, rather than signing up and paperwork and stuff, the government used IRS records and said, \"Hey, you made X amount of money last year, we're going to give you a stimulus check based on that. Cool, here you go.\" And so by cutting out a lot of middlemen and a lot of administrators, you can actually cut down on a lot of corruption with UBI. That's not something that has really come up in many of the studies. It's not like most of the studies that we've seen, they talk about the impacts on education and employment and investment and those sorts of things. What you really don't see is evidence of corruption or elite capture based on this. And the fact that everyone gets the same amount means that it's also harder to game the system. So, Universal Basic Income as the foundation at the state and federal level is pretty resilient. But again, you also don't want to be entirely dependent on the government.\r\n\r\nNext is **public wealth fund dividends**. So this is the endowments, the trusts, and those sorts of things. Again, there is some risk of accumulation, but this is mostly going to be government corruption as the primary risk here. And again, we're not reinventing the wheel. Plenty of nations, particularly in Europe, have national wealth funds. Several states have endowments and trusts and funds and those sorts of things. So we know how to govern those transparently and effectively while minimizing waste and corruption and elite capture.\r\n\r\nSo then the next level is **collectively owned private assets**. So this is going to be stuff that is on the market, stuff like land and solar farms and DAOs and those sorts of things. Now, this is where elite capture is going to be still a risk factor. So, for instance, rental properties: BlackRock and other people are just buying up every rental property that they can get. So let's just use that as an example. One thing that you can do is that everyone from counties to states to federal governments can put caps on the amount of, particularly single-family homes, that can be owned by capital, by investments and VCs and foreign investors and those sorts of things. So that's just one example of, on a case-by-case basis, we can look at the asset class and say, \"What's the best way of actually regulating this asset class such that it avoids full elite capture?\"\r\n\r\nNext is **personally accumulated assets**. Basically, this will remain mostly unchanged. You can buy treasuries, you can buy T-bills, you can buy stocks and bonds, you can buy rental properties. None of that really changes. But the biggest thing is, how do you, as a little guy, fight against the big dogs? And that's where collectively owned assets come together, is because rather than collective bargaining power, which is what labor unions created, now we're focusing on credit unions, which boost collective purchasing power, meaning that even if you are trying to compete with BlackRock and foreign Chinese investors and those sorts of things, you can pool your money to pull some of those resources back into American hands.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, finally, **residual wages**.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nSo anyways, I hope this all helps clear up the overall plan for post-labor economics. Thank you everyone for watching all the way to the very end, and all the feedback. It's also very helpful when I see where people are getting it, where they're confused, and those sorts of things. So, all that being said, thanks for watching all five episodes of the Post-Labor Economic Lecture Series. I will see you next time.

There will be subsequent updates and supplementary material as the framework continues to evolve and coalesce. Today\u2019s focus is \u201cBridging the Gap\u201d or, stated differently, \u201cHow Do We Get There From Here.\u201d The central question is: \u201cHaving established the necessity of transitioning to a property-based economic future due to the decline of wages and the undesirability of relying solely on government transfers, what exactly are we attempting to build?\u201d After conducting a series of workshops and evaluating feedback, I have synthesized a simplified graphic depicting the future sources of composite household income.\n\n### The Post-Labor Income Pyramid\n\nAt the foundation\u2014note that the size of each layer does not necessarily represent the relative magnitude of income derived from that source, but rather its foundational role\u2014is Universal Basic Income (UBI).\n\n**Universal Basic Income (UBI)**\nThe foundational layer comprises Universal Basic Income, potentially sourced from state, federal, or even municipal levels. Certain cities are already piloting UBI schemes. Not all jurisdictions will have the financial capacity for this; only wealthier cities and counties are likely to afford it. Discussions of a global UBI exist, which I intend to examine in future analyses, though I currently view it as neither practical nor necessarily desirable. For now, a feasible scenario is state and federal UBI, ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars per month.\n\n**Public Wealth Fund Dividends**\nAbove UBI, the next easiest to implement are public wealth fund dividends. These would be administered at the municipal, state, and federal levels. Precedents already exist, including trusts, royalties, and mineral rights\u2014most notably, the Alaska Permanent Fund, which, although only amounting to a few hundred dollars per month, can accumulate meaningfully when combined with other income streams. At the federal level, revenues could be derived from activities such as spectrum auctions; at the state level, from mineral rights and right-of-way charges; and at the municipal level, from assets like solar farms. These assets are state-owned, which is technically socialism, but the proposal is not to nationalize all assets\u2014only those where public management is logical and demonstrably beneficial. Numerous examples already exist worldwide of governments at all levels successfully operating such wealth funds.\n\n**Collectively Owned Private Assets**\nThe subsequent layer consists of collectively owned private assets, including credit unions, cooperatives, banks, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). While some propose cryptocurrency as a solution, Bitcoin, as a currency, is not sufficient on its own, and DAOs may not solve all issues. The critical point is that these are private assets held collectively, and this structure requires enabling legal reforms\u2014such as the legal recognition of DAOs as entities. Despite the anti-government ethos among some DAO advocates, without legal enforceability, widespread adoption will remain limited.\n\n**Personally Accumulated Assets**\nNext are personally accumulated assets, such as stocks, bonds, and rental properties. This layer remains largely unchanged under the new paradigm.\n\n**Residual Wages**\nFinally, residual wages persist. Although some individuals will be entirely displaced from traditional employment, many will still secure gig work or other labor. For example, content creators who generate ad revenue technically derive both personal asset income and wages, as active effort remains necessary. Thus, the \u201cresidual wage\u201d category will persist, even as its proportion diminishes.\n\nThis structure forms the \u201cincome pyramid\u201d envisioned for post-labor economics.\n\n### Projected Evolution of Income Sources\n\nA practical example: suppose in 2029, following the next presidential election, a UBI of $300 per month is implemented. An individual earning $30,000 per year (barely above current poverty wages) may supplement this with UBI and small returns from public wealth funds, collectively owned assets, and minor personal investments. While those with only $30,000 annual income may not hold substantial assets, this serves to illustrate how income sources may diversify from day one.\n\nFive to six years later, projections could see UBI increase to $1,000 per month, with wage income dropping to $12,000\u2013$20,000 per year. Meanwhile, public wealth fund dividends, collectively owned asset returns, and personal asset income are expected to grow. By 2040, a plausible scenario is UBI totaling $3,000 per month (combining municipal, state, and federal programs), $25,000 annually from public wealth fund dividends, $15,000 each from collectively owned and personal assets, and residual wage income. Such a portfolio approaches $100,000 per year, compared to $37,000\u2013$41,000 previously. Although ambitious, this outcome is within the realm of possibility.\n\n### Historical Precedent: Crisis, Crash, and Reform\n\nThe pathway to implementation is illuminated by historical precedent. Economic crises follow a recurring trajectory: crisis, crash, and reform. Major unemployment shocks historically proceed through panic, immediate cash relief, and the subsequent creation of lasting social programs. Within 18 months of joblessness exceeding 10%, Congress has instituted enduring structural transfers\u2014seen in 1935 (Great Depression and Social Security), 1958 (post-war recession and Extended Unemployment Insurance Act, Area Redevelopment Act), and 2009 (Great Recession and stimulus measures). The political impetus for structural change typically activates when unemployment reaches or remains above 10\u201314%.\n\nThis threshold does not require apocalyptic joblessness; rather, a sustained high unemployment rate is historically sufficient for legislative action. Furthermore, official unemployment figures may understate the actual extent due to evolving measurement methodologies, with underemployment and marginal attachment further inflating the \u201creal\u201d rate. When conditions become sufficiently adverse, Congress reliably implements durable relief programs, beginning with cash transfers such as UBI, provided unemployment remains elevated.\n\n### The Policy Response Ladder\n\nPolicy responses escalate along a familiar three-stage ladder: monetary, fiscal, and finally, structural interventions, each employed as the effectiveness of the previous is exhausted.\n\n- **Monetary policy:** The Federal Reserve reduces rates to zero and initiates quantitative easing. This provides only short-term relief and cannot be sustained indefinitely.\n- **Fiscal policy:** Temporary stimulus payments are deployed to revive demand, but their impact diminishes with repetition, and sustainability issues arise, including funding and inflation.\n- **Structural reform:** Permanent, asset-based income sources\u2014such as dividends and UBI\u2014anchor long-term economic stability once monetary and fiscal measures are no longer effective.\n\nEach stage\u2019s limitations force escalation to the next, with historical experience demonstrating that increasing economic hardship induces policymakers to adopt progressively broader reforms.\n\n### The Initial UBI Stimulus\n\nA preliminary UBI\u2014$300 per month for every U.S. adult\u2014is sufficient to stimulate aggregate demand while more substantive, dividend-based reforms are developed. With 250 million adults, such a program would be nearly frictionless to administer, as demonstrated by the recent stimulus checks. The amount is modest enough to be politically feasible, yet significant enough to provide tangible relief. A more gradual phase-in, starting at $50 per month, may be advisable; even such a small amount ensures basic nutritional needs are met for many. The annual cost, roughly $900 billion (3% of current GDP), is substantial but manageable, especially when offset by automation taxes levied on corporations.\n\nInflation risk is frequently raised. However, widespread job loss and technological automation are inherently deflationary. UBI may, in fact, be necessary to counteract downward pressure on prices. If the economy trends toward deflation and conventional monetary policy is exhausted, direct cash transfers may become the preferred remedy. This approach serves as a transitional mechanism: while wages will continue to dominate near-term income, starter UBI provides a stabilizing influence and an opportunity to refine implementation.\n\n### Bootstrapping Local Wealth Funds\n\nCounties and states can initiate future dividend streams before federal action by converting untapped corporate equity and public assets into perpetual income sources. Two primary mechanisms are proposed:\n\n- **Share Grant Tax Credit:** Firms receive a 15% state tax credit for donating company stock to county trusts, aligning corporate interests with local economic resilience. This incentivizes companies operating locally to contribute to community wealth in exchange for tax benefits.\n- **Dormant Asset Leasing:** Public assets such as bandwidth, carbon sinks, or land can be leased rather than sold, retaining long-term value for communities and ensuring sustainable revenue.\n\nTrusts can then begin distributing modest dividends on a per capita basis, piloting post-labor income models at the local level. Many counties and cities already operate such royalty and land trusts, so this approach extends proven mechanisms.\n\nCoalition-building among beneficiaries\u2014residents and participating firms\u2014creates a constituency supportive of broader structural reforms. This \u201ccopy-paste template\u201d can be adopted by any locality with taxable firms or public assets, enabling nationwide dissemination.\n\n### Timeline for Implementation\n\nThe transition is envisioned as a ramp-up from 2025 to 2035, unfolding in three phases, each triggered by economic indicators and paced according to AI and automation developments:\n\n- **Phase One (2025\u20132028):** Launch county wealth fund pilots and enforce short-week, job-share arrangements to mitigate initial displacement. While such labor adjustments may be of limited efficacy and potentially resisted by employers, they are included for completeness.\n- **Phase Two (2029\u20132032):** Enter a hybrid income era, with shrinking wages supplemented by $300\u2013$600 in monthly dividends as unemployment and reduced working hours persist.\n- **Phase Three (2033\u20132035):** Achieve a mature system in which dividends account for over 50% of median consumption, rendering work optional for basic needs. Although aggressive, this trajectory may be necessary. The timeline for robotic and AI adoption may extend into the 2040\u20132050 period, but wage erosion will continue as automation scales.\n\nKey metrics to monitor include the official unemployment rate (U3), year-over-year declines in hours worked, and the ongoing divergence between wages and profits.\n\n### Stakeholder Game Plan\n\nEach of the four principal economic actors\u2014households, firms, banks, and government\u2014plays a critical role in the transition to a post-labor economy:\n\n- **Households:** Enroll in county wealth funds and advocate for trigger-based UBI, thereby shaping political priorities. Even without explicit awareness of post-labor theory, declining job opportunities will drive political demand for change, likely dominating the 2028 presidential election.\n- **Firms:** Contribute equity for tax credits, pilot four-day work rotations, and pre-commit to dividend contributions from automation gains. While voluntary corporate participation is unlikely, targeted incentives can make such contributions rational.\n- **Banks:** Both commercial banks and local credit unions should underwrite dividend-backed consumer credit and package wealth fund shares as low-risk assets, making these income streams accessible and secure.\n- **Government:** Implement dashboards for economic triggers, authorize tax-incentive share grants, and mandate caps on working hours as necessary. Ultimately, government action is indispensable for enacting UBI and facilitating participation by all stakeholders.\n\n### The Final Income Portfolio\n\nThe mature post-labor household income portfolio will draw from three principal sources: modest residual wages, predominant property-derived dividends, and a stable transfer floor. Diversification across banks, local funds, and federal programs will spread risk and preserve individual agency\u2014a core value that must not be surrendered to prevent authoritarian outcomes.\n\n- **Residual Wages (20%):** This estimate reflects jobs that appear robust to automation; the aggregate may shift, with some individuals retaining high wage income while others receive none. High-liability and licensed professions, as well as attention economy roles, will persist, but most routine jobs will vanish.\n- **Property Income (60%):** The bulk of income will derive from trust fund dividends and share-based distributions.\n- **Government Transfers:** Safety net programs, including unemployment insurance, Social Security, and UBI, will continue, providing a universal floor. In some countries, such as Germany, transfers approach 25\u201330% of income; the U.S. is likely to retain a lower proportion due to prevailing political attitudes.\n\n### Failure Modes to Avoid\n\nThe following five risk channels represent potential pitfalls that could impede or reverse the transition; each must be vigilantly managed:\n\n1. **Rapid Automation Surge:** If AI and robotics scale faster than society can adapt, households may face temporary income gaps. Implementation lags, regulatory hesitancy, and business skepticism are likely to be the main bottlenecks rather than the technology itself.\n2. **Elite Wealth Capture:** Regulatory or corporate obstruction could concentrate new income streams at the top, depriving the general populace of dividends even as consumer demand collapses. The pyramid model helps identify and mitigate elite capture at each level.\n3. **Policy Paralysis:** Government inaction or entrenched partisanship may freeze necessary trigger responses, stranding workers. However, historical precedent suggests that severe unemployment eventually breaks through political gridlock.\n4. **Slow-Boiled Complacency:** Gradual, less-visible displacement may foster societal complacency, repeating decades of wage stagnation. In reality, automation has undermined wages for over seventy years\u2014a fact substantiated by historical data.\n5. **Demagogic Backlash:** Populist leaders may exploit voter anxiety, promising to restore lost jobs and obstructing structural reforms with unrealistic pledges.\n\nEach layer of the pyramid can be structurally reinforced to prevent elite capture:\n\n- **Universal Basic Income:** State and federal UBI schemes have demonstrated low corruption risk, as observed with stimulus check distribution. Universal eligibility and reliance on existing records reduce opportunities for manipulation. UBI is robust, though overreliance on government support is not ideal.\n- **Public Wealth Fund Dividends:** These instruments can be governed transparently, as evidenced by successful national and subnational funds worldwide. The principal risk is governmental corruption, which can be mitigated through best practices and oversight.\n- **Collectively Owned Private Assets:** Market-based assets, such as land and DAOs, remain vulnerable to elite capture. Regulatory mechanisms\u2014such as ownership caps on single-family homes by institutional investors\u2014can mitigate this risk on an asset-class basis.\n- **Personally Accumulated Assets:** This layer is largely unchanged; individuals can continue to invest in treasuries, stocks, bonds, and real estate. The advantage for individuals is augmented through collective institutions like credit unions, enhancing collective purchasing power and counterbalancing large-scale investors.\n- **Residual Wages:** This category is self-explanatory, reflecting ongoing but diminishing opportunities for labor-derived income.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis presentation clarifies the proposed pathway for post-labor economics.
