Each of these is suited to someone with a strong background in mathematics:\n\n1. **\"Complex Analysis\" by Lars Ahlfors**  \n   - A classic and rigorous text that provides a deep understanding of the fundamentals of complex analysis. It covers key topics like conformal mappings, harmonic functions, and analytic continuation. \n\n2. **\"Functions of One Complex Variable I & II\" by John B. Conway**  \n   - These two volumes are highly recommended for a detailed treatment of complex analysis. Volume I focuses on foundational concepts, while Volume II dives into more advanced topics, such as the Riemann Mapping Theorem and analytic continuation.  \n\n3. **\"Complex Analysis\" by Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi**  \n   - Part of the Princeton Lectures in Analysis series, this book covers complex analysis with a clear and elegant approach. It discusses complex integration, power series, and applications, and includes exercises to strengthen understanding. \n\n4. **\"Theory of Complex Functions\" by Reinhold Remmert**  \n   - This book provides an in-depth and formal treatment of complex function theory, focusing on topics like Weierstrass theory, meromorphic functions, and elliptic functions. Remmert\u2019s approach is rigorous and thorough.\n\n5. **\"Geometric Function Theory\" by Steven G. Krantz**  \n   - Ideal for readers interested in the geometric aspects of complex analysis. This book discusses topics such as conformal mappings, the Schwarz lemma, and Hardy spaces, blending complex analysis with geometric function theory.\n\n6. **\"Analytic Function Theory\" by Einar Hille**  \n   - This classic text, in two volumes, covers topics like the theory of analytic functions and singularities, providing both depth and rigor. Hille\u2019s treatment is elegant and includes various advanced topics not found in standard texts.\n\n7. **\"Introduction to Complex Analysis in Several Variables\" by L. Hormander**  \n   - For an exploration beyond single-variable complex analysis, this book dives into the multi-variable theory, covering important results in the function theory of several complex variables. \n\n8. **\"Advanced Complex Analysis: A Comprehensive Course in Analysis\" by Barry Simon**  \n   - This book is part of Simon's multi-volume set and covers advanced complex analysis topics in great detail, including asymptotic expansions, the Riemann mapping theorem, and analytic continuation. \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like specific recommendations for particular subtopics or applications within complex analysis, such as potential theory, analytic number theory, or geometric aspects."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"8131e7c9-fcae-4b24-afc4-bf34a2405db6","request_id":"8d90d7e15afacde9-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8131e7c9-fcae-4b24-afc4-bf34a2405db6","children":[]}}}
