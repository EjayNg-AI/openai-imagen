","### Prologue: The GPU Black Market and US\u2013China Tech Cold War\r\n\r\nInterviewee: If they don't have it, they come here.\r\n\r\nInterviewee: These CPUs are assembled in China. So they apparently, I guess, have spares, and they buy it from these warehouses which are on the upper floors of the building. They just have cartons. There are probably a dozen tall and about the same deep. They're quite well utilized.\r\n\r\nNarrator: One of them sent me this price sheet. We're multiple administrations deep in a technological cold war over processing power between the United States and China. China's cyberspace administration has labeled some US graphics processing products as a security risk, seeking answers about US government back doors in silicon. Meanwhile, the United States has imposed heavy restrictions on exports of graphics processing units, or GPUs, being sold to Chinese companies by American companies. The sale requires rarely granted licenses for each import scenario to legally export GPUs above a certain performance level, with the stated objective being to restrict progress of private and government projects, including AI development in China, while trying to maintain the US's AI leadership. The United States takes this so seriously that just this week, the Department of Justice had two Chinese nationals arrested in California for what it alleges is the smuggling of tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of GPUs. Because where there's prohibition, there's smuggling.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We spoke to everyone about this Nvidia AI GPU black market in China and the US. We found middlemen who connect buyers and sellers.\r\n\r\nNarrator: This is it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Cool. Wow.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Users who can understand the demand and explain it using the most dystopian definition of wealth: how many GPUs they have.\r\n\r\nInterviewee: They have much more GPUs than the university.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Which GPU?\r\n\r\nNarrator: Wow.\r\n\r\nInterviewee: And we got them quite cheap.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What model?\r\n\r\nInterviewee: This is the A1\u2014A100.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Oh, A100. These are A100.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We also found independent repair shops who, simply doing their jobs, salvage valuable silicon components from dead PCBs of banned GPUs, innovatively hand-modifying them to be better than and have more VRAM than Nvidia's own official product SKUs.\r\n\r\nTechnician: They should make one right now.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Okay. Okay.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We met multiple people who, when asked the same question, gave the same passcode-like Chinese idiomatic expression\u2014Nvidia.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you think Nvidia knows? Do they try to stop it?\r\n\r\nNarrator: And among others, we even spoke with a US-based Chinese national buying video cards in the US to strip them and ship the GPUs to companies in China, violating US export control law.\r\n\r\nViewer: I haven't seen someone have a computer in a car for a long time.\r\n\r\nNarrator: These nervous laughs come from a viewer of ours while meeting in Arizona with a GPU smuggler we'll call The Plug. The smuggler spoke limited English, but they both understood one universal truth.\r\n\r\nThe Plug: Oh, the temperature is too hot.\r\n\r\nViewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Okay, two universal truths. The second one is money. In this battery-operated Prius-mounted GPU testing rig, FurMark is the least suspicious thing in his car, with a spare license plate in the trunk. We'll come back to The Plug later. Black market is normally a phrase associated with drugs or guns, but there's a new kind of black market, and it's high-end AI GPUs. And this particular black market is worth billions of dollars a year. It's hiding in plain sight.\r\n\r\nNarrator: This is Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n### The Big Adventure: Asia Itinerary and Setup\r\n\r\nNarrator: This was our latest big adventure, and it began when we booked a 24-hour ticket to Hong Kong. Twenty days of hotels across Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Janjjo, Hujo, Donguan, Taipei, and more. At least one of us got detained by at least one of the governments involved in this video, but we can't talk about these indecipherably singular or plural instances or instance of any aforementioned detainment. Next, we talked to a lawyer about the previous sentence, loaded into a cab that secured our luggage like this, then investigated whether or not GPUs are actually smuggled with lobsters into Hong Kong. Nvidia was right. We've checked the lobsters for sensitive electronics, and there aren't any in there. So, good move, Jensen.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We found a pile of GPUs that are now export controlled and met a professor who really wants to make sure you know these are legally obtained. Legally obtained. We came to a sudden realization that if a banned GPU is assembled in China, then what's to stop them from just taking it off? Actually, very good question, because what's preventing these GPUs from falling off of the line? Line. Exactly. We made friends with three different cats in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What do you think of the temple guards? Tannon, they're very good at their job. We said goodbye to this RGB city. We then booked a boat to Shilo, China. I told Tannon what Shoko means.\r\n\r\nTannon: What does that mean?\r\n\r\nNarrator: Snake's mouth. Sounds inviting, right?\r\n\r\nTannon: Yeah. Awesome. Can't wait.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We arrived in Shenzhen, made small talk with hotel room service.\r\n\r\nNarrator: So, how long have you worked at the hotel?\r\n\r\nNarrator: We immediately got trapped in the hotel elevator by my new friend.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Traffic jam.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We almost witnessed a workplace accident, got kicked out of a warehouse.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We got kicked out.\r\n\r\nCompanion: Yes, we did.\r\n\r\nNarrator: And then we instantly became fans of using high-speed rail at hundreds of miles an hour to go deep into China to meet a guy who really thinks that desoldering a GPU and rebaling it is no big deal.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Really?\r\n\r\nTechnician: That's the easy part.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Oh, really? Okay.\r\n\r\nTechnician: It's a lot easier than doing this.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We got a ton of information in this video about GPU smuggling, including from this guy named Five. After that, we went back to Shenzhen for the third time in two weeks. Met this guy\u2014supported game natures, supported Jesus.\r\n\r\nInterviewee: Yeah. Yeah. I'm the\u2014he\u2014his father.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We went back to Hong Kong, flew to Taiwan, got some street food, and got on a plane back to the US.\r\n\r\n### Background: Why AI GPUs Are Banned\r\n\r\nNarrator: Before we get to any of those interviews, we need to establish the basics of this geopolitical mess. The story is complicated, so we'll start with defining these key facts: why these GPUs are banned, the new 15% license which only applies to two GPU models, who buying and selling is legal or illegal for, and then the timeline. AI GPUs have been in even the mainstream news constantly. China has spent decades modernizing its military with the express goal of catching up to the US. AI-enabled drones are key to achieving that goal.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We still sell billions of dollars a year of semiconductors to China. We just cannot let them access the most sophisticated, cutting-edge artificial intelligence chips. The export ban did prevent China from getting the highest-end American chips, but it did not stop China from catching up in the AI race. China's AI technology is getting a lot better. The concerns over Chinese focus on AI. China's China. China's China. China. China.\r\n\r\nNarrator: This story has been a complete mess to follow. It spanned years and now two US administrations. We ended up with over 400 pages of research and maps and finding sources and trying to understand the laws. Here's why governments care about AI GPUs. Nvidia functionally holds a GPU monopoly in our sector of the industry, which is building computers to play video games. That now feels relatively innocent by comparison to AI. The company leveraged decades of gaming domination to build a foundation for what it now focuses on, which is making the most powerful GPUs for AI in the world. Reports warn of Nvidia product use in nuclear weapons research, facial recognition technology allegedly used in Russia to suppress dissent, and growing concerns of AI facial recognition use in the US for similar deployments, alongside reports of use in international spying and in drone warfare. Nvidia finds itself in the middle of all of this.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Even though Nvidia disputes selling to some of these entities\u2014for example, it says that it doesn't sell GPUs to Russia\u2014the products still find their way there. So Nvidia is making money one way or the other. Someone is buying it, maybe from someone else who bought it from someone else. And much like we're talking about today, it might be transacted through smuggling. But Nvidia does end up selling the device ultimately to somebody. Regardless of who they sell to, Nvidia plays a big part in this worldwide obsession with AI. AI, AI, AI, AI, AI, AI, AI, AI, AI, AI, AI will also create AI using AI to create AI. And we think it's playing all sides. We'll talk about that more at the end, though. And besides, when there's a gold rush, it's better to sell the pickaxe than swing it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: There are so many companies that would like to build. They're sitting on gold mines. Gold mine. Gold mine. It's a gold mine. Gold mine. Gold mine. It gives me tremendous joy if you just buy something from Nvidia. We're going to be rich. Although the US doesn't talk too much about its own use of AI, it spends a lot of time talking about China's. These semiconductors are unbelievably powerful and we can't let them get into the wrong hands. We want the most other countries using our technology because again, it's a zero-sum game. The concern of course in Washington and particularly amongst the Defense Department and the Pentagon is that these chips and this hardware and software end up with the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese military, and will help them accelerate in terms of innovations on that front. The restrictions are really on advanced semiconductors that could have potential military applications, and the goal is really to choke China's AI sector and its broader AI ambitions.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The US restricts Nvidia's GPUs through export control rules that ban the sale of certain GPUs into China. That means the sale of GPUs by American companies or companies which want to transact business in America to companies that are in China or the Chinese government itself. Some examples of export-controlled GPUs include gaming GPUs like the RTX 5090 and the RTX 4090, which are useful in AI applications mostly for their high VRAM capacity. It also includes specific data center and AI GPUs like the A100, H100, H200, and B100, with the letter being the signifier for the architecture, as well as other GPUs shown on the screen. Now, this list is in flux. There are some new and incoming exceptions for the Nvidia H20 specifically, which has faced Schr\u00f6dinger's GPU ban depending on whether CEO Jensen Huang had a $1 million dinner at Mar-a-Lago with Donald Trump on a given week.\r\n\r\n### Timeline: Export Controls, H20 License, and Policy Whiplash\r\n\r\nNarrator: A timeline would help, but we have nine years to recap. So, we'll do it quickly. Even at the end of the Obama administration in 2016, the US government was just starting to talk about AI in relation to national security in this Wired interview.\r\n\r\nObama: Developing international norms, rules, protocols, verification mechanisms around cybersecurity generally and AI in particular is in its infancy. You\u2019ve got a lot of non-state actors who are the biggest players. Part of the problem is that identifying who\u2019s doing what is much more difficult. If you\u2019re building a bunch of ICBMs, we see them. If somebody\u2019s sitting at a keyboard, we don\u2019t. And so, we\u2019ve begun this conversation. A lot of the conversation right now is not at the level of dealing with real sophisticated AI but has more to do with essentially states establishing norms about how they use their cyber capability.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Who are you more afraid of, Big Brother in the state or the guy who\u2019s trying to empty out your bank account?\r\n\r\nObama: Part of the reason that\u2019s so difficult is that if we\u2019re going to police this wild west\u2014whether it\u2019s the internet or AI or any of these other areas\u2014then by definition, the government\u2019s got to have capabilities. If it\u2019s got capabilities, then they\u2019re subject to abuse. And at a time when there\u2019s been a lot of mistrust built up about government, that makes it difficult.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Those were the early days. The first Trump administration started a commission advising Congress on maintaining AI leadership, including simply banning the sale of some advanced semiconductor equipment and chips to China. Several years of back and forth, a pandemic and election, and ChatGPT\u2019s launch later, and the Biden administration took major action in 2022 by restricting exports to China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture A100 and newer code name Hopper H100 GPUs and systems were all restricted. Nvidia shed tears for $400 million worth of lost sales as a result. And it was especially sad when many of its export compliant alternatives to these also got banned, like its newly created A800, H800, and L40S in addition to Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4090 gaming card. Nvidia said it didn\u2019t expect \u201cnear-term meaningful impact\u201d on its financials. Nvidia responded by designing a workaround to the previously worked-around workaround, leading to the H20. Then the government added new rules for high memory bandwidth cards and the Biden administration tried to come up with an AI chip diffusion rule that would limit the quantity of GPUs being sold into different countries rather than only by processing power metrics, because the government really didn\u2019t know how to measure these things and Nvidia, knowing more about GPUs, could tweak any dial it wanted to just barely be compliant.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Then DeepSeek came out, everyone panicked, stocks plummeted, and the government scrutinized the role of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in it. In February 2025, fiscal year 2025 results are posted and Nvidia\u2019s Singapore revenue rockets to 18% of total revenue based on customer billing location despite shipments to Singapore being claimed to be less than 2% of fiscal year 2025 revenue, causing people to say, \u201cWait a minute.\u201d Unrelated, several GPU smugglers are arrested in Singapore one day after the fiscal year report was posted, causing people to say, \u201cAh, that makes more sense.\u201d AMD spawns out of nowhere to say it wrote down $800 million of inventory due to export controls. Nvidia one-ups it with a write-off of $5.5 billion. In May 2025, Trump implements wide sweeping tariffs and rescinds the Biden chip diffusion rule that would have limited how many AI GPUs Jensen could sell to other countries.\r\n\r\nJensen Huang: It\u2019s just an incredible vision. I think this is going to be a transformative idea for the next century for us. These two initiatives are completely visionary and it\u2019s going to be transformative for America.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The H20 GPU that was created to comply with the rules was still okay. Then Jensen had dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago for a million dollars. Then the H20 got banned. Must have chosen a really bad restaurant. In July, Jensen Huang meets with Trump and is permitted to sell H20s again, presumably choosing a better restaurant this time. Huang goes to China. China says Jensen\u2019s GPUs have tracking devices\u2014back doors. Nvidia says, \u201cNuh-uh.\u201d Jensen goes to Washington.\r\n\r\nTrump: Jensen, will you stand up? What a job.\r\n\r\nNarrator: He loves him. He loves Nvidia. He loves Lisa Su. And more importantly, he hates Intel\u2019s CEO. Intel\u2019s CEO goes to Washington. Trump likes him now. Tim Cook materializes from the Infernal Plane to give Trump a 24 karat gold \u201cgift,\u201d and gift is in scare quotes because that\u2019s not what that\u2019s called. Then we get to this past week when Trump asked Nvidia and AMD to pay 20% to the US government for sales specifically of the H20 and AMD Instinct MI308, not all GPUs, as some erroneously reported previously. Cousins Jensen Huang and Lisa Su negotiate Trump down to 15% and now they\u2019re allowed to sell two specific cards that were originally created to comply with the laws before they changed. And somehow everyone walks away a winner. Except now China doesn\u2019t want them anyway.\r\n\r\nNarrator: That about sums it up. Except one last thing that happened as we were filming this. The Department of Commerce doesn\u2019t yet know the legality of the deal, with Tom\u2019s Hardware highlighting legal expert arguments over Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution. That\u2019s not our area, so we\u2019ll move along from it, but just know that this is being publicly discussed still. If you want the full details with all of the in-between, we did collect it. There will be a massive timeline article on the website. We\u2019ll link that below when it\u2019s up within a couple days.\r\n\r\nNarrator: There was also recent news about a 15% revenue share between Nvidia and AMD with the United States government for sale of some AI GPUs.\r\n\r\nTrump: This is an old chip that China already has, and I deal with Jensen, who is a great guy, and Nvidia. The chip that we\u2019re talking about, the H20, it\u2019s an old chip. China already has it in a different form, different name, but they have it, or they have a combination of two that will make up for it and even then some. But the H20 is obsolete. You know, it\u2019s one of those things. But it still has a market. So I said, \u201cListen, I want 20% if I\u2019m going to approve this for you, for the country, for our country, for the US. I don\u2019t want it myself.\u201d You know, every time I say like 747, I want\u2014I want\u2014for the Air Force. So I just wanted\u2014so when I say I want 20, I want for the country. I only care about the country. I don\u2019t care about myself. And he said, \u201cWould you make it 15?\u201d So we negotiated a little deal. So he\u2019s selling essentially an old chip that Huawei has a similar chip, a chip that does the same thing. And I said, good, if I\u2019m going to give it to you\u2014because they have a stopper, what we call a stopper\u2014are not allowed to do it. A restricted is really known as a restrictive covenant.\r\n\r\nNarrator: If you were to only read the headlines, you might think this applies to all GPUs and that the ban is over. And then you might think that a market in China, or in the US\u2019s eyes an illegal market in China, would cease to be so illegal. That\u2019s not the case.\r\n\r\nTrump: I release them only from the H20.\r\n\r\nNarrator: This new 15% revenue share would, if it\u2019s legal\u2014and they\u2019re not sure yet\u2014allow Nvidia to specifically sell the Nvidia H20 GPU to approved Chinese entities; they likely can\u2019t be on the entity list. It would allow AMD to sell specifically the Instinct MI308 GPU to approved Chinese entities. The proposed license would not affect any other GPU that currently does not have a license. The government hasn\u2019t made clear yet if Nvidia\u2019s partners would also be permitted to make these sales. That means that other banned GPUs, including the RTX 4090, RTX 5090, H100, B100, B200, and so forth, remain banned. The H20\u2019s extremely high 96 GB memory capacity would enable large models to fit in memory and actually run, especially with multiple GPUs in a single rack, even if it\u2019s slower. That means companies can achieve performance targets by stacking GPUs, which are lower clock and core count but higher capacity, and doing Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s favorite thing: scaling in that way.\r\n\r\nTrump: Now Jensen also has a new chip, the Blackwell. Do you know what the Blackwell is? The Blackwell is super duper advanced. I wouldn\u2019t make a deal with that. Although it\u2019s possible I\u2019d make a somewhat enhanced\u2014in a negative way\u2014Blackwell. In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it. But that\u2019s the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won\u2019t have it for five years on the Blackwell. I think he\u2019s coming to see me again about that. But that will be an unenhanced version of the big one.\r\n\r\nNarrator: For now, these super duper GPUs are not licensed for sale. In short, the H20 and MI308 were compliant with the US government\u2019s original rules. Then the rules changed during design and production. They were banned. Then AMD and Nvidia collectively declared over $6 billion in financial impact as a result. Then the US government said, \u201cWait a minute. We can help with that if you cut us in.\u201d It reminds us of our tariffs documentary.\r\n\r\nNarrator: And with this, if I see a tariff of 20% or 40% one week, 50% to 60% a day later, then I see it 120%. Then I see, well, electronics are maybe exempt in Bloomberg, and then I see on Truth Social, no, that\u2019s not actually happening. I have no idea what that means. So, I can\u2019t make decisions because it\u2019s not about it being a high tariff. It\u2019s about not having a clue what\u2019s going on. The H20 most certainly is not obsolete, though. It\u2019s still very desirable in China, and with a lot of them, they become particularly potent.\r\n\r\n### Calculating the Ban: TPP, Memory Bandwidth, and Moving Goalposts\r\n\r\nNarrator: Setting a threshold for banned hardware should be objective since it can be tested. This is a graph from the Department of Commerce that visualizes the original threshold at which a computing product became automatically banned for export to parts of the Middle East and China without a granted license. There have been some changes since, but back when this was made, the total processing performance score on the Y-axis was used to determine cards in need of a license. The government needed a metric to calculate against, so it created its own.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Accelerators and video cards have a lot of metrics in their spec sheets, including memory capacity, which is critical and as simple as a pass/fail for certain AI and training use cases. They have hard numbers for memory bandwidth, GPU clock speed, GPU or CU count, TPCs, tensor cores, ROPs that are sometimes randomly missing on Nvidia devices, teraflops, TOPS, petaflops, gigaflops, gigabits, power, and more. So then banning a product could probably be based on some sort of benchmark rather than a random metric from a spec sheet. But the US government, illustrating what an absolute cluster [__] this situation was and now remains, decided to instead multiply one random metric from a spreadsheet against the bit length of the operation being executed. FLOPS or floating point operations per second and TOPS or tera operations per second are calculated by the company making the spec sheet and aren\u2019t a great measure of actual performance. These numbers are based on both marketing and whether we\u2019re talking about FP8, half-precision floating point 16, single-precision floating point 32, double-precision FP64, integer performance, or tensor performance or otherwise.\r\n\r\nNarrator: So the government says, \u201cthe rate of MAC TOPS is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible,\u201d and, \u201cthe rate of MAC TOPS is assumed to be the highest value the manufacturer claims in brochures for the integrated circuit.\u201d So it\u2019s not based on a bunch of real-world benchmarks of applications or something. The government also references MAC TOPS as the theoretical peak of tera ops in multiply-accumulate computations. The Biden administration used this total processing performance, or TPP, score in 2023, with the government later adding a performance density metric dividing the TPP by the die area in square millimeters. In other words, the government didn\u2019t want Nvidia to be able to sell more of a lower-performance GPU to make up for the loss of high-performing parts with multi-GPU solutions.\r\n\r\nNarrator: There are a lot of reasons this doesn\u2019t capture the full picture, like sparsity, APIs, different methods to calculate FLOPS, and different performance for different applications. But the government needed a way to define a threshold, so this is what they made. The limit was a TPP score of 4,800, exceeded by even the RTX 4090 when calculated using tensor performance. Now, if this doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, that\u2019s okay because it probably doesn\u2019t mean anything to people signing the laws either. Or maybe that\u2019s not okay, but you get the idea. Something like a higher memory capacity, lower-FLOPS-performance GPU, or even a series of GPUs like 3060 12 GB cards, might be able to get the work done more effectively if it only needs memory. Memory wasn\u2019t factored into the TPP calculation. That was the point of the Nvidia H20.\r\n\r\nNarrator: But then the absurdity of the situation expanded because the government introduced an opaque memory bandwidth requirement. Per The Register: \u201cUnlike with previous export controls, the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security hasn\u2019t issued specific guidance on how much IO or memory bandwidth is too much.\u201d But they did decide that there would be a limit. So to recap, it seems like across two administrations, the United States is creating formulas based upon numerical calculations, and then when Nvidia and AMD tweak the numbers to fit within that box, it\u2019s retconning those rules in a guess-and-check process.\r\n\r\n### Our Informants and the Smuggling Pipeline\r\n\r\nNarrator: We spoke to a lot of people for this story to go on record and learn about the dystopian world of high-tech GPU smuggling. We spoke to people ranging from owner-operator trading companies to professors of economics building data centers. In order of appearance today, the discussions come from Dr. Vinci Chow, senior lecturer in the department of economics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, responsible for building his department\u2019s machine learning servers and sourcing the GPUs from middlemen suppliers. Dr. Zu Ha Fu, a research assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and an affiliated lecturer at the University of Cambridge. Zuhao specializes in both computer science and linguistics. Various retail workers at computer markets in Hong Kong to get a ground-level understanding. Joe, the creative director of product at video card manufacturer Yeston, who worked with us for a separate piece\u2014not this one\u2014but he showed us his factories and suppliers. So, we\u2019ve included clips here, as we relied on those tours for an understanding of how GPUs are brought into China for assembly on PCBs. An anonymous seller who goes by the pseudonym of Silver, based in Shenzhen Bao\u2019an, and managing a warehouse in Hong Kong that receives and processes smuggled GPUs. Vincent, a resourceful fence who lives next to the warehousing and markets filled with GPUs and accelerators. He buys and sells these devices in Shenzhen Hua and his job is to know people, in addition to Vincent\u2019s cousin, the fixer\u2019s fixer. If someone needs a component to fix a broken video card or to build a new one, they go to people like him to get integrated circuits. Mr. 5, a Billy Billy hardware reviewer with a specialized focus on thermal solutions. Like us, Mr. 5 has had run-ins with Nvidia that have ended in a soured relationship over disputes regarding independent reviews and editorial independence. Junga, a renowned Billy Billy uploader\u2014basically a YouTuber in China\u2014who runs a video card repair shop in Jano. In addition to repairs, he regularly gets large orders from customers asking him to build them custom unofficial higher VRAM capacity Nvidia GPUs for large language model tasks. Companies in Singapore and Taiwan who act as intermediaries between Nvidia, Nvidia\u2019s partners, and companies in China. The Singaporean and Taiwanese companies are able to bring banned GPUs and servers into their own warehouses and resell them to Chinese companies, skirting export controls. We\u2019re unable to disclose their identities because there would be punishment from multiple governments and Nvidia. The Plug, a US-based Chinese citizen who drives around the country buying hardware from American end users and resells it to companies in China and Hong Kong. And finally, a special thanks to our translator, Raymond Woo of the Black Soda Agency in Taiwan.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Here\u2019s the pipeline. If a GPU doesn\u2019t fall off the back of a truck in China after it was assembled, or if it isn\u2019t a QC defect that disappears from the scrap pile, it may instead have been moved by ants to get to China. May Banana is a linear pipeline. Each ant in the fire line serves a specific role. It\u2019ll help to name those roles to keep everything straight. Here\u2019s what we came up with. The source has access to GPUs. This could be as innocent as you unknowingly selling your card on Facebook Marketplace to The Plug. The Plug is responsible for acquiring from the original source and reselling the hardware to the China-based distributors. In between, there\u2019s a mule. Sometimes this is The Plug himself doing a trip home. We learned that overseas students also regularly return with what are feasibly defended as personal GPUs that they bought at Best Buy and then may get resold for markup and profit. In either case, the mule gets the GPU into the country either by shipping it without interception or by hand-carrying it. Next is the middleman, receiving the GPUs and often interfacing with or managing the warehouses that store the cards. The middleman buys from multiple plugs, including factories that get rid of rejects with fixable or unimportant QC defects, then sells those devices to more localized distributors. That\u2019s when we get to the fence, who buys and sells GPUs between middlemen and warehouses to end users in China. Then we have who we\u2019re calling the fixer, except this time it\u2019s literal. The fixer is an optional step that may involve soldering and modifying a GPU to improve it beyond its original specification and make it more marketable for domestic AI uses. They might also just fix QC defects from factories. Finally, we have the user. This is self-explanatory. The user is the demand driver, and oftentimes large enterprises want dozens or hundreds of GPUs or more, while smaller users like the university may just want individual units or small batches. With everyone\u2019s role named, let\u2019s continue. And now we start our journey. First stop, Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n### Part 1 \u2014 Hong Kong: Demand Drivers and University Cluster\r\n\r\nNarrator: Upon arriving in Hong Kong, after checking out the local wildlife, we set out to understand the demand side of the market. We found Dr. Vinci Chow through a Reuters story from a couple of years ago. Vinci works in the economics department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and he\u2019s responsible for having built many of the servers and machine learning systems that are in use daily. He has a whole blog detailing his process, including the difficulty of sourcing components and the ease of fixing problems when so close to Shenzhen, such as having custom PCIe riser cables built and basically done the same day. Dr. Vinci Chow is the right person to start us off with this story and educate us on where to go next. We\u2019re here to learn the user\u2019s perspective, because before there could be any kind of market for it, there has to be demand, and that is what the university and organizations like it generate.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Hi.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: How you doing? Nice to meet you.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Good to meet you. This is Tannon.\r\n\r\nTannon: Hi. Nice to meet you, sir.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We can set up shop here. It\u2019s a construction site right now. We are renovating.\r\n\r\nNarrator: An interesting anecdote is that Dr. Vinci Chow actually went to school with someone important at Nvidia today, the vice president of applied deep learning research.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: I was actually in Berkeley the same time as Bryan Catanzaro. We\u2019re forum buddies.\r\n\r\nNarrator: That\u2019s cool.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Yeah, I know him.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We won\u2019t be able to do much talking in here because of the noise.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: These are legally obtained. These are legally obtained.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We got it.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Actually very interesting, because we got these right before the ban\u2014no, right before ChatGPT was released. Around several years ago. And we got them quite cheap. One of them was actually modified from SXM before everything GPU became such a scarce resource. There was a period of time right after crypto crashed that GPUs were actually quite cheap. Even A100 was actually quite cheap. We were able to get these for less than $10,000. And then Chinese chat came out and everything went crazy. Even now, if you go on AliExpress, you still see a lot of 2080 Ti being modified. For teaching we use a 3060 because, without modification, in that generation it has the highest memory capacity.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Right.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: But it\u2019s all gone. Clearly there\u2019s demand. It probably makes sense for us to get the mics on.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Because of the way we shot this, you get to see something you don\u2019t normally get to see in our stories, which is all of the conversation leading up to formally filming. Sometimes there\u2019s more interesting information when we\u2019re just spitballing.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: I guess even universities have become more secretive. In the past, universities have been very open in terms of what we\u2019re doing, what we are capable of. These days, I think there are second thoughts. The collateral damage is in, and on the other hand, it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s an export ban. It\u2019s illegal to export to China without a permit, but then it\u2019s completely legal on our side. There\u2019s nothing that says that you cannot buy high-end GPU. So from our end, as long as we follow all relevant procedures, there\u2019s absolutely nothing illegal about us over here buying these GPUs. That makes for a very interesting environment.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Yeah.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: If you look at university documents, obviously these universities have been purchasing GPUs. It\u2019s completely legal on our side. Yet this is clearly not supposed to happen from the perspective of the US government. For universities, it once again depends a lot on how committed a particular researcher or a particular unit is when it comes to approving GPUs. If you pay enough, supply is there. Maybe not if you want to build a super cluster. For research, most researchers are talking about one or two GPUs. And if they have the funding, then it\u2019s possible to obtain that. Everything is more expensive.\r\n\r\nNarrator: That makes sense.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: I\u2019m in the department of economics, which is kind of interesting for someone in the department of economics to talk about GPUs. We started building our own cluster during COVID. Well, not just we, but me. I\u2019m responsible for that. It\u2019s \u201cwe\u201d because the department has to fund it. I plan these things out, but the department funds it. I started building my own desktop computers back when I was in high school. Hong Kong is a small place. You can physically visit computer malls where you can just pick whatever parts you want. During COVID, we had this idea that we probably have to provide remote access to computing power. The first GPUs we have were 1080s that we obtained from the computer mall. $500 each. Back then I was thinking, that\u2019s so expensive\u2014$500 for a GPU.\r\n\r\nNarrator: If you were to ask a local supplier how much, let\u2019s say, an H200 is going to cost?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: It\u2019s going to be about 30K US. There\u2019s a big premium for data center GPUs. Even if you obtain an aging A100, that\u2019s still going to be almost 20K.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is anything from Blackwell over here yet?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: No. Not yet. It\u2019s illegal for a company like Nvidia to sell them into China, but not for anybody here to buy them.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We\u2019ll get to the supplier process shortly. First, we wanted the user\u2019s view from another department.\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): Hi, I\u2019m Steve. I\u2019m currently working in the linguistics department. My focus is still doing some programming and running on GPU. My background is computer science, so I need a lot of GPUs.\r\n\r\nNarrator: So you\u2019ve got the computer science background.\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): Yeah, I got a computer science background in this university.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you have your own server cluster? Is it separate from econ?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): Yeah. I think they have the best one. This is the best one in this university.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Who built the one for the arts department?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): Actually we use the university\u2019s GPU. The university has a central GPU and everyone can use that. If you buy some GPU, they can help you to manage that GPU.\r\n\r\nNarrator: So it\u2019s shared.\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): I believe they have much more GPUs than the university. GPU richer.\r\n\r\nNarrator: GPU rich.\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): Yeah.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What are the things you use them for normally?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): Training and inference, large language models. My research is about language model. If you want to train a model, teach the model to gain more knowledge, you need to fine-tune. Before, maybe a few years ago, we trained from scratch, but now it\u2019s not that popular. We still need GPU to fine-tune models.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What are the common uses for the models themselves? Do students use them for research?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): If you are in the university, it\u2019s for research. A large language model can do a lot of things. A lot of research departments will focus on using that. A lot of research will be focused on how the large model can help them. For example, cleaning the data and doing some basic inference, or imitating humans to do some research. Something like this.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you ever end up working with each other?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: No, we haven\u2019t. Our two faculties are in talk of collaboration. A lot of demand really comes from researchers using these models for processing large amounts of text data. In the past, researchers would hire junior research assistants to go through text data manually. It\u2019s a very expensive and slow process. These days, all you have to do is feed the text data to an LLM, and that really drives an explosive growth in demand for these LLMs. Because OpenAI is not interested in serving Hong Kong, which is part of China, there\u2019s a lot of demand for on-prem solutions.\r\n\r\nNarrator: In linguistics, is it mostly analysis and simulation?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): If you want to do research in linguistics, you will be interested in what the language model is thinking. We try to explain what happens inside the language model. Another research direction is using the language model to process data. For example, you want to know how children learn language\u2014children learn bilingual or many languages\u2014how they do it. You can use the language model to imitate the learning procedure. So there are a lot of things to do.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What kinds of GPUs do you use?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): Currently for our group we have A40, I guess, with 48 GB memory, maybe\u2014I forgot. Sometimes we have an A6000 and then some gaming GPUs, RTX series.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The gaming GPU is much faster?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): Actually, yes. I have used the 4090, but not 5090. Memory is the most important part for researchers. If it\u2019s running slow, then you can wait for one day or two days, it doesn\u2019t matter. But if the memory is small, then you cannot do anything. You cannot put your model inside the GPU. It just doesn\u2019t run at all. So I need larger memory. The speed is okay. Currently it\u2019s fine.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you get bottlenecked by availability?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: It does happen. As much as we have GPUs\u2014we have something like 30 top-of-the-line GPUs\u2014if we want to load, say, DeepSeek R1, that takes probably 60. That\u2019s half our capacity. If one of our teachers says \u201cI need DeepSeek R1 for two months,\u201d then it takes a bit of planning because we have to balance the needs of other users. It\u2019s not going to be enough if you want state-of-the-art, given how big these models are. All researchers would love to scale up what we do, but the reality is it might not be possible to get the hardware to support what we want to do.\r\n\r\nNarrator: If you had unlimited budget, would you be able to get as many GPUs as you want, or is there still a supply constraint?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Even if somehow we obtain millions of dollars of funding, there\u2019s still the problem of the export ban. Before the export ban, it could be done. Another local university, HKUST, obtained a full H800 superpod at a considerable cost, but the university was able to fund it and they managed to get it right before the ban. From today\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They did it and they benefit from it. Their researchers get a full 400 GPU cluster to work with. It\u2019s university-wide, centrally funded. It\u2019s just not something we can do right now.\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): In CUHK it\u2019s managed by each group, I believe. The computer science department also has a very big one. Here it\u2019s a bit decentralized.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Part of the problem, as I\u2019ve mentioned, is that with the export ban, departments are not necessarily willing to publicly list their computing capabilities.\r\n\r\nNarrator: I think the next thing we should probably check out is the server.\r\n\r\n### Part 1 \u2014 Hong Kong: How Suppliers Get GPUs and Data Center Tour\r\n\r\nNarrator: I messaged some sellers on Alibaba and one of them sent me this price sheet. Tell me what you make of this. Do you have any H200s in your servers?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We want some. We want some.\r\n\r\nNarrator: I can connect you to the supplier.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We want some. After tax, they want 213,000. What is that in US? Let\u2019s see. That is $29,700 US. That\u2019s about right. For the few companies that actually list a price, the premium is, as I said, surprisingly low. It\u2019s almost the same as the MSRP as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you know how these companies\u2014the suppliers\u2014get the GPUs? I came across a Chinese phrase in one of the Baidu searches I did. I think it was \u201cma yi ban jia,\u201d the idea being that a bunch of people move one GPU at a time.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: These GPUs are almost certainly moved one at a time. It\u2019s very hard to get a full HGX system. These days, most recommend getting the PCIe versions of the GPUs because it\u2019s so difficult to smuggle in a full HGX system. Now, if you want an HGX system, for example, the companies that have ways of obtaining them would recommend that they be installed in a different country. Basically, acquire HGX and have it installed in Southeast Asia. It would actually be physically located somewhere else and then you remote into it. That\u2019s what they would recommend if you want that. If you actually want it on-premise\u2014if you want it here\u2014then almost every one of them would recommend that you just get the PCIe version.\r\n\r\nNarrator: When you put in an order to buy something, is it already guaranteed here at that point, or do they have to get it?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Depends. Some companies have limited stock. We\u2019re talking about maybe a dozen. If you want more, then it would probably have to be ordered with a deposit and shipped in from somewhere else.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Any idea what happens if they get caught? I mean, to your money.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We don\u2019t pay until delivery. Actually, we have to pay a deposit. But I presume if they cannot deliver, you get it back. We would be able to get it back locally. We\u2019re not doing anything illegal, so we can just go to the court.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do the local governments even care? If it leaves the US\u2014if Nvidia decides to ship it straight from Santa Clara to Shenzhen\u2014that would be a problem. But on the receiving side, do they care?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: In Hong Kong, I would say we probably don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think the government is going to obtain these GPUs now that there\u2019s an export ban. In Hong Kong, we have basically the government-funded two H800 superpods, but they are both legally obtained, right before the ban. Since then there hasn\u2019t been news that they\u2019re going to expand their capacity. I would say the government\u2019s probably not going to do it themselves. The only thing they care about is if someone brings it in, they pay the import taxes.\r\n\r\nNarrator: But there\u2019s no import tax in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We are a free trade port. You can pretty much bring whatever you want\u2014normal exclusions like firearms. Macau is the same. Free trade port.\r\n\r\nNarrator: I\u2019m pretty sure these GPUs don\u2019t go straight from the US to Hong Kong. They probably go through Singapore.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Singapore comes up a lot. Malaysia is another place that comes up. I saw a story from The Economist where they referred to \u201cdata smuggling,\u201d bringing data from countries with the export ban to Singapore to have it processed locally. It\u2019s similar to what some companies have offered us to consider: given how hard it is to bring in a large system, it\u2019s easier either to fund a system in Malaysia or Singapore, or you just rent capacity there and remote access. If the reason you have to take physical hard drives back and forth is due to the size of the data, it\u2019s going to be hard to transfer remotely. Otherwise the idea is the same: given that you cannot bring the system in, just have it somewhere you can access.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Well, in a university the working language is English and then Mandarin, right?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: The university\u2019s name\u2014I have to clarify because people always ask this question\u2014the Chinese University of Hong Kong. We teach in English. \u201cChinese\u201d means Chinese culture, Chinese heritage, not Chinese language. That\u2019s what a lot of the exchange students were confused about. They thought we teach in Chinese. No, we teach in English.\r\n\r\nNarrator: So this is your cluster.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: They\u2019re quite well utilized. This is actually not part of the cluster\u2014this is our non-cluster stuff like web server and such. These two racks are the cluster.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Did you have to do anything special for the air conditioning?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: These GPUs are very hot. A single 8-GPU system can put out like 4,000 W\u2014like two hair dryers. A 4U unit these days\u2014these ones\u2014these are all 8-GPU systems. Our cluster was built up over almost five years. We have some really old systems from five years ago, and we keep adding things. That\u2019s a bit different from, say, a full superpod, which is purchased in one go; everything will be the same. Here we just keep adding capacity and leave the old components until they\u2019re not useful anymore.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Did you have to do special power design, power delivery?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Yes. You cannot just plug these GPUs into a wall socket. It would blow the fuse immediately. We need two three-phase power lines specially installed in this room. They have these massive plugs for power. You can see the flex duct work pulling in all the exhaust from the servers and piping that up. They\u2019re basically circulating it with the flex duct work. And there\u2019s more AC going up to the mini-split up top.\r\n\r\nNarrator: How many A100s or H100s?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We have something like 30 A100-class GPUs, and then we have a bunch of 3090s and 3060s. In total we\u2019re talking about 50 or 60 GPUs. The top-of-the-line GPUs are for teachers.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What are the 60-class cards for?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Teaching. We have undergraduate machine learning courses and we let students load Hugging Face models. These 3060s are for them. We don\u2019t want them to occupy the A100s. The good 3060s have 12 GB of memory. That\u2019s more than enough to load some of the smaller models we want the students to work on. We make sure we get the 12.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Does memory bandwidth matter a lot?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: It matters. To better utilize the resources, we offer the option for each researcher to load their own model, but we also have a centralized local ChatGPT-like thing. We use Open WebUI with vLLM as a backend. For getting high throughput, bandwidth matters. For the export control, the US government does a calculation\u2014some amount of points\u2014they made up a system, and memory bandwidth is one of the components of the formula. They\u2019re getting smarter because there have been multiple versions of the ban. The very first ban was targeting NVLink\u2014the A100 to A800. That has little effect. It\u2019s a bit slower, but it\u2019s still okay. Then they switched to targeting FLOPS. There was a certain amount of FLOPS you couldn\u2019t exceed. Depends on workload. I don\u2019t think it worked as well as they might have hoped because the H20s still sold really well.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The government hasn\u2019t really caught up to what these are, so they don\u2019t know how to ban it. They just pick a number.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: It\u2019s developing very fast. If you go back five years, everyone probably thought that FLOPS is a very important metric to consider. Turns out when it comes to loading large models, what we all care about is how much memory\u2014how much VRAM\u2014you have. You simply cannot load a model if you don\u2019t have the VRAM. So now H20 becomes a very attractive option.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What\u2019s the spec on the H20 again?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: H20 has drastically lower FLOPS, but it actually has more memory than the original H100\u201496 versus 80. So in some sense it\u2019s more attractive.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Everything you\u2019ve named so far is Nvidia. Are there any non-Nvidia GPUs in the university cluster?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Currently I didn\u2019t see any non-Nvidia ones, but AMD is promising. PyTorch also supports AMD. In the future it will be another choice.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The Instinct MI GPUs?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We always like to explore options to have more computing power. We actually expressed interest in AMD and asked around to the incoming suppliers, and they said that the risk is too high for them because they have to support it. There\u2019s one supplier who told me they had tried to sell an Instinct GPU in the past and the customer returned it because they couldn\u2019t figure out how to make it work. They realized they don\u2019t really want to carry the risk of having a GPU that people are going to return, so they would rather just not deal with it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What about Intel?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We like to explore options, but right now, support-wise, it\u2019s not there for us.\r\n\r\nNarrator: If it\u2019s a smuggled device and you have a problem, what happens?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We obtain all these under university procedure, and part of that is that there should be warranty. The supplier is clearly going to promise you warranty. For the PCIe version, they\u2019re pretty confident they can support it. They just change it for a new one and move that one out\u2014one at a time. But if it\u2019s an HGX system, even if they manage to get it in, they don\u2019t promise anything. For contractual reasons they will promise warranty, but whether they can actually do it, they can\u2019t guarantee. We have a legally obtained HGX 800 system that we got before the ban, and as far as I know, after our initial five-year support contract ends, it\u2019s not possible to renew. That\u2019s a 4U system with eight H800 inside.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you ever physically go to pick up the GPUs when you\u2019re arranging from a supplier, or do they just ship it here?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: They usually ship here. It\u2019s totally normal commerce. They just ship it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: When you think about the concept of \u201cblack market GPUs,\u201d you\u2019d think of a dark alley and handing him cash and he hands you a GPU, but that\u2019s not how it works.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: No. They just ship it. It\u2019s good for personal usage. It\u2019s not quite good for a very big cluster.\r\n\r\nNarrator: So if it\u2019s that easy\u2014where it just ships to you\u2014does the ban seem effective?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Effective in preventing the building of a very big cluster. It\u2019s just not possible to get 100,000 of these GPUs like we heard about some of the other companies having. We don\u2019t really have that many. We don\u2019t have that many.\r\n\r\n### Part 1 \u2014 Hong Kong: Military Concerns, Huawei, and Circumventing the Ban\r\n\r\nNarrator: So if it\u2019s that easy\u2014where it just ships to you\u2014does the ban seem effective?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Effective in preventing the building of a very big cluster. It\u2019s just not possible to get 100,000 of these GPUs like we heard about some of the other companies having. We don\u2019t really have that many.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Why do you think the US government cares so much? What is it they\u2019re trying to prevent?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): I guess they just want to delay the speed of other countries training the model. But the ban is very weird, actually.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you feel like the ban is targeted at military uses\u2014where they\u2019re trying to prevent that\u2014and then it just happens to affect you as well? Or are they targeting just companies in general?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): I guess it\u2019s in general. Everyone is influenced by this. It just delays the speed of research. For example, if I can have a better GPU, I can finish in one day, but now two or three days. That\u2019s fine\u2014just wait a little bit and you get the same.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: I don\u2019t think from the US government\u2019s perspective there\u2019s this distinction between Chinese academia versus Chinese military versus Chinese commercial. I don\u2019t think they really consider there\u2019s a distinction. It\u2019s just a very general ban.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Huawei has the new Ascend. Is that interesting at all? Does it seem promising?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): Huawei\u2019s GPU\u2014they built that for many years and they also trained some language models based on that. Currently, none of my friends are using it, but maybe in the future they\u2019ll try if they still cannot get the Nvidia one.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you guys need CUDA for your stuff?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Oh yeah, definitely. If you want to train the model you need CUDA. We can still get by because we\u2019re not really needing that many GPUs. There\u2019s still enough Nvidia supply around for what we need. But if we want to scale up, then Nvidia is just not possible right now. Eventually something like Huawei Ascend would be a way.\r\n\r\nNarrator: You said you have an interesting GPU that was modded.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: We have several GPUs. This is one of those reference boards\u2014blower-style. This is a 3090. It\u2019s very Chinese-specific. I don\u2019t think they were popular in the US. You could get them, but not many, because they\u2019re noisy. The only reason to get these is because you want multiple of them packed closely together. It\u2019s designed for that purpose. One of these is a normal PCIe version of A100, and this one is actually a modded version\u2014but they use the same casing. This one is modded from an SXM version. If you install it and take a look at the Nvidia system information, this will show as SXM. But they look the same.\r\n\r\nNarrator: How is that possible?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: As far as I understand, these GPUs are assembled in China. They apparently have spare casings. If a banned GPU is assembled in China, then what\u2019s to stop them from just taking it? Even the H200 seems to be assembled in China. I have no idea what\u2019s preventing these GPUs from falling off the line.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Manufactured in China, but not allowed to be sold there.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Exactly. The boxes at least state they are manufactured in China. Nvidia is not allowed to sell it to China, but they can make it here and then ship it somewhere else, and then they can\u2019t ship it back. It just seems like if I\u2019m the factory, there\u2019s a lot of money. We had some QC defects, so my guess is they must be spares\u2014spare SXM modules, spare casings\u2014and then somehow these spare parts get assembled into a complete GPU and get sold. It has the flavor of that: all these high-end GPUs are still manufactured in China, but they\u2019re not allowed to be sold in China. Somehow the US government thinks that\u2019s going to work, and somehow the Chinese government also allows that to happen. I have no idea how actually that whole thing works.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The GPU silicon is made at TSMC in Taiwan. They make it there, they ship it to the factory in China, and then an SMT line must populate the board.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: One of the A100s we have that are modded\u2014I think one of the NVLinks doesn\u2019t work. My explanation is probably failed PCB. And then it just gets assembled. So you have two out of three NVLinks. It\u2019s just going to be slower, but for a bargain price. It was cheaper than a fully functioning one, but it doesn\u2019t make a difference if you\u2019re just using one GPU. So it\u2019s a bargain.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you think Nvidia knows that all of this is happening?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: I would be surprised if they don\u2019t. These are very expensive items. I would imagine you would keep track of everything. It\u2019s hard to know what they plan to do with all these defective parts, but I\u2019d be very surprised that no one has ever thought of the possibility that if it\u2019s something so valuable, someone would come up with a use for even a defective one.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Could we pull out one of the GPU servers if it doesn\u2019t disrupt you?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: This is one of our older ones because this one is basically assembled completely from retail parts. This whole system was obtained around the time when ChatGPT came out. Everything you can get from AliExpress\u2014the case, CPU, RAM. By far the hardest to get is the power supply.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What makes it difficult?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: It\u2019s very hard to get high-quality, high-power, server-grade power supplies. To support four A100s, you need something like a 2,000 W power supply and you need server-grade redundant PSUs. There\u2019s just no demand from retail customers for these kinds of power supplies. If you buy this case, mostly they come with something like 800 W power supplies and we need 2,000. That\u2019s the hardest part.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is this a redundant power supply?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: This is a redundant PSU. The CPU is an EPYC 7763 that you can get from AliExpress, and the board is from ASRock Rack. It\u2019s a server line with seven PCIe slots. We want an InfiniBand network, so we had these PCIe cables specially made to the length we need to support the InfiniBand card\u2014HDR 200 Gb. Our cluster is pretty much exclusively EPYC now. We had last-generation Xeon CPUs when we started five years ago, but we moved to AMD.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is all this stuff pretty high priority for the university at this point?\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): I think the university is realizing how important this is. They\u2019re beginning to buy more GPUs and trying to find some strategy to share with the whole staff. It\u2019s a good sign, but it\u2019s just a start. We\u2019ll try to catch up quickly.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Hong Kong is a free trade port, but mainland China is not.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Designed for Hong Kong. They don\u2019t sell it anymore. Hong Kong is a free trade port. Hainan and some parts of Shanghai also make similar policy\u2014no local tariffs, no import taxes, and relatively simple paperwork.\r\n\r\nNarrator: This is the university mall\u2014where you hold commencement and graduation ceremonies. That\u2019s the Science Park of Hong Kong, and you actually see one of the unicorns a little bit\u2014SenseTime.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: SenseTime does facial recognition\u2014AI, AI, AI\u2014but they kind of built their business on facial recognition, CCTV stuff. The Chinese government is a big customer.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you feel like you\u2019re locked in at this point to Nvidia because of CUDA? What matters more, the power of the hardware or the power of CUDA?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: If someone put in enough effort so that non-Nvidia hardware runs just as well as Nvidia hardware in PyTorch and then vLLM and stuff, it would not be too hard for us to switch. But that\u2019s harder to do than to say. Someone has to put in the effort to make the models run smoothly. There has to be a good reason to switch, and that part is hard.\r\n\r\nDr. Zu Hao Fu (Steve): If you switch to other devices, you will have a lot of bugs. Some bugs you cannot fix\u2014you need the whole community to help you. This is a very slow procedure. Definitely CUDA and Nvidia currently is the best you can choose.\r\n\r\n### Part 1 \u2014 Hong Kong: GPU Market Walkthrough and Wiring Money\r\n\r\nNarrator: After this discussion, Vinci brought us to one of his favorite tech spots in Hong Kong, the Golden Computer Centre and the outdoor tech flea market next to it. We asked if we could go find some supposedly banned GPUs like the RTX 5090, except available in public where in theory you shouldn\u2019t be able to find it. The hope was to find a shopkeeper with some ground-level or consumer-level knowledge. Everyone wants Jensen\u2019s flavor.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you still frequently go to the market?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Not as often as before. I\u2019ve mostly switched to using server components, and you can\u2019t get these components in these markets. Our cluster is pretty much exclusively EPYC, which was rare when we started building five years ago. My guess is these GPUs are probably smuggled in from Southeast Asia unless those countries try to enforce the ban. Most of them probably wouldn\u2019t care\u2014it\u2019s not their ban. Why cross the Chinese, right?\r\n\r\nNarrator: They\u2019ve got two choices, right? Piss off America or piss off China.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: That\u2019s why the Biden administration had this idea where you separate the world into different zones\u2014some zones are trusted and some are not. But this was scrapped. So now it\u2019s back to one by one by one. I haven\u2019t heard anything about countries having to prove themselves to be trustworthy anymore.\r\n\r\nNarrator: It must be frustrating for Nvidia on some level, because I\u2019m sure they would rather be able to sell whatever they want to China. If they come up with a product that is in high demand, that means it\u2019s useful for AI, and if it\u2019s useful for AI, the US government wants to ban it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you think the export controls are having their desired effect?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Yes, in terms of stopping China from building a comparable GPU cluster to the US. If you want to buy thousands, it makes it a lot harder. Even if you\u2019re buying, say, 400 for a superpod, Nvidia is likely going to be directly involved.\r\n\r\nNarrator: I do wonder\u2014if you make it hard enough to get US products, eventually China would just dump its own resources into helping a domestic competitor.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: China is already doing that. The Chinese government is trying very hard to come up with a competitive GPU.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We headed to Dragon Centre.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Watch your belongings.\r\n\r\nNarrator: I asked if it\u2019s safe to leave it in the car, and the first time we see \u201cbelongings\u201d is from the police.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: They\u2019re pretty transparent.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Parallel import.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Parallel import.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What does that mean?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Not imported by an official distributor. Practically, it means smuggling.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What are their prices?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: The ROG ones are always expensive, but it\u2019s not worth that much\u2014the price difference. When supply is tight, sure.\r\n\r\nNarrator: One is $5,223 US. That\u2019s almost two 5090s at home for us. The cheapest one is about $3,024\u2014$3,057 US. That\u2019s pretty close to the average price in the US. The average price is $3,500 right now. It\u2019s actually like the same.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: The 5080, I guess, is still okay. It\u2019s not banned. The 5090D wasn\u2019t that expensive at first, so the price has probably gone up. It\u2019s more expensive than the cheapest 5090. It\u2019s possible that it still comes with warranty. Three years Hong Kong warranty\u2014I think what that means is that the store promises they\u2019re going to help you. These ones were imported back when it was legal, so I think they actually have official warranty.\r\n\r\nNarrator: I wonder if you bought one when it was legal if you still get support.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: That\u2019s the case. At least that\u2019s the case with our data center GPUs.\r\n\r\nNarrator: There\u2019s a D. The D is banned now.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: They can come up with DD or D2. The price has gone up now. It\u2019s going to be better.\r\n\r\nNarrator: You can buy a 5090 FE here. It\u2019s supposed to be banned, but you can just buy it at retail in a store.\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: It\u2019s not illegal to buy them. What surprises me is how easy it is to buy them. The price is HKD 36,000\u2014over $4,000 US. About $4,600 US. You can get it there.\r\n\r\nNarrator: So the main impact of a ban is the price goes up.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Any idea how they get their 5090s?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: Same way we do. One by one. I\u2019ve heard that some students would buy one from Best Buy and bring it straight back. If the premium is great and they can double their money, they\u2019ll do it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is there any law against bringing it in for personal use in Hong Kong?\r\n\r\nDr. Vinci Chow: No. From the US side, if customs stops you, they\u2019d have to find it in your bag and know the model and care. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: We only get 5090 stock. The 5090 Founders Edition\u2014maybe not in stock. We directly order from other countries.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What\u2019s the most popular card?\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: 5090. Normally comes from Australia. Second is Thailand.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The 5090 normally comes from Australia and Taiwan?\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: Yeah.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Can you buy bulk\u2014a lot of them at once\u2014or is it just one at a time?\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: Very tricky. Some models you can\u2019t order from mainland China. For 4090, you can buy a lot. Recently we got the app from Facebook that are selling in Mong Kok. They will provide lots of 5090.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is it expensive?\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: Very interesting. 5090 sometimes cheaper than 5090D.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you ever sell RTX 6000?\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: RTX 6000 ADA Edition. Replacement will be ADA Edition, but no Blackwell.\r\n\r\nNarrator: For 5090, do you have to get it from a different supplier than the ADA cards?\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: Some models yes, some models no. Because of the card problem, the distributor can only send back to the original place. But a local distributor can do DOA or RMA. Because of the US problem\u2014like 4090 or 5090\u2014if they got problems, they cannot get back to China.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you have any idea how the mainland suppliers get the 5090s?\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: No idea. Too many suppliers. They are doing trading. They can transfer from other regions to Hong Kong. We have no idea what way they come, but we can know which region. Australia, Taiwan, Thailand get lots of stuff. Last generation 4090\u2014the price rose very high. I don\u2019t think that in 50 generation they can make lots of offers. But it\u2019s not like what they thought.\r\n\r\nNarrator: It is still funny to me how much it flies in the face of US export control that you can just walk around in a public-facing mall and buy a 5090. Given that it is very expensive, but it\u2019s not like you just can\u2019t buy it anymore. If you really need it, you can get it. I don\u2019t think locals think much about buying the GPU. It\u2019s just added in price. It\u2019s expensive. But the fact that there\u2019s an export ban\u2014I don\u2019t think it crosses the mind. They don\u2019t really consider it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: One of our next stops sent a message the night we were planning to hitch a ferry to Shekou Port in Shenzhen. He told me they had just received a batch of GPUs to their Hong Kong warehouse and that they were en route to their Shenzhen facility, and that we could buy a GPU as soon as tomorrow as long as we wired him money immediately. That seems like the responsible thing to do. And because it\u2019s fully above board as a buyer, and because he also texted me a photo of an RTX Pro 6000, which was very intriguing since it\u2019s Blackwell, we decided the best way to learn about buying export-controlled GPUs in China would be to just do it. So far, all the contacts we spoke with were aware that some form of factory repurposing, theft from the line, QC reject repurposing, repair, and actual by-hand smuggling are involved, but none of them knew for sure how the GPUs actually move. To get closer to the source of the movement, we decided to wire those funds and get an address.\r\n\r\nNarrator: You there, Stephen?\r\n\r\nStephen: Yes.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Stephen?\r\n\r\nStephen: Yeah.\r\n\r\nNarrator: How\u2019s it going? All right, you ready to help here?\r\n\r\nStephen: Yeah.\r\n\r\nNarrator: So I\u2019ve got $3,289 going out.\r\n\r\nStephen: Perfect.\r\n\r\nNarrator: That\u2019ll be from the GN account, and then it\u2019s going to their bank. The account number is\u2014SWIFT, I guess, is what you need probably.\r\n\r\nStephen: Okay. Good to go. I will get this done for you.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Perfect.\r\n\r\nStephen: Okay. Thank you.\r\n\r\nNarrator: All right. Have fun. Be safe.\r\n\r\nStephen: Thanks. See you.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Bye. We\u2019ll see if the money\u2019s gone in two days. That\u2019ll be our next adventure. We packed the hotel, said goodbye to the famous Hong Kong junk boat, potentially said goodbye to $3,000, and boarded a ferry to Shekou Port. But we\u2019re going to take a quick detour in the story here because we have a source who says he has more information on how GPUs get into China. Before checking with our GPU middleman and our fence, we\u2019re first going to meet up with someone else.\r\n\r\n### Part 2 \u2014 China: Mr. Five on Smuggling and Nvidia\u2019s Blind Eye\r\n\r\nNarrator: Next up, we took a couple-hour car ride to Hujo to meet with a guy known as Mr. Five. Hujo is a city with some serious grit. The city has grown to take some of Shenzhen\u2019s factory industry as it\u2019s been pushed out over the years with Shenzhen\u2019s expansion and as it\u2019s turned into more of a metropolis. This is a complete 180 from the finance hub that we were just in. We\u2019ve spent a good amount of time in Hujo over the last decade, mostly visiting case, painting, tempered glass, bending, and tooling factories alongside those for heat sinks like video cards. He\u2019s a cooling hardware reviewer and has specialist knowledge in factories that make video card cooling solutions, including Nvidia\u2019s. This experience allows him more access to information about the peculiar relationship between the factories making the cards and the companies that on paper can\u2019t sell them to the country where they\u2019re made. We instantly related to Mr. Five for his own editorial dispute with Nvidia\u2019s review sampling process, where we\u2019ve both felt that the company seeks to control review direction. His username is 51972 on Bilibili. Even if you can\u2019t speak Chinese, you should check it out because he\u2019s got charts and everyone can read those. Most of this interview is in Chinese, but we\u2019ve transcribed it in subtitles and there are English sections as well. The next interviews will be a mix of both languages.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: We are joined by Five\u2014that is his English name. I noticed when we came to China in SEG market, I noticed a lot of 5090s. Do you think most of the banned GPUs come in one at a time?\r\n\r\nMr. Five: Mhm.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: It seems a little bit weird that these products are made in China. They\u2019re made here, but technically they\u2019re not allowed to be sold here.\r\n\r\nMr. Five: Mhm.\r\n\r\nMr. Five: So essentially, China is the lead manufacturer for thermal solutions, but once you get into politics, it\u2019s just something where you don\u2019t have much control. Given the entire global political situation, this is not a surprise anymore. So even though, on a logic standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense, it\u2019s politics.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Do you think Nvidia knows about this?\r\n\r\nMr. Five: Turn a blind eye.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\nMr. Five: Just turn a blind eye.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: It\u2019s too much money to be made.\r\n\r\nMr. Five: Mhm.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So they\u2019re not going to address it directly or acknowledge it, but they know what\u2019s going on. Do you think Nvidia would want to stop it?\r\n\r\nMr. Five: No. No way.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. Cool. Viewers, where should they go to find his channel?\r\n\r\nMr. Five: 51972.\r\n\r\nNarrator: This was an interesting conversation. First of all, I learned a new idiom. Secondly, we turned it into a t-shirt. So if you\u2019re liking this content so far, please take this brief intermission to head over to store.gamersnexus.net and grab our Blind Eye t-shirt to directly support this content if you like it. Long-form content is hard to do on YouTube, and we can do it because of your support. We try to make some pretty damn cool stuff to get you something useful in return as well. And if you\u2019re watching this sometime close to when we publish, we\u2019ve still got the digital reward tiers available for our backer tiers for this project. We really want to produce more stuff like this. But from our point of view, we need to earn that. If you think we have, head over to store.gamersnexus.net and grab one of our new Blind Eye t-shirts, Black Market sticker packs, GPU VRAM glassware, or even our GPU Shredder t-shirt for the paper launch. Thanks for the intermission. Let\u2019s get back to it. Up next, Shenzhen.\r\n\r\n### Part 3 \u2014 Shenzhen: Middlemen, Distributors, and Buying a Blackwell Card\r\n\r\nNarrator: Our first stop will be in Shenzhen, Bao\u2019an, to meet with a trading company that sits between Hong Kong and Shenzhen warehouses. They\u2019re the trading company\u2019s trading company, and we\u2019re buying an RTX 5090 from them\u2014if they exist, hopefully. Shenzhen was a fishing village just 40 years ago. Now it\u2019s one of the most technologically advanced cities on Earth, and it\u2019s grown unbelievably fast. Shenzhen got growth from pushing farming and fishing out and bringing factories in. Now it\u2019s even starting to push some of the factories into the outskirts. Shenzhen has some extreme cyberpunk vibes with its mix of technology and surveillance. It has packed tech markets in Huaqiangbei, including some of the weirdest computer parts we\u2019ve ever seen in our prior visits. There are entire buildings dedicated only to small phone repair shops with their own kiosks. Another building dedicated to a mix of computer hardware, gaming, and miscellaneous components. More still for just integrated circuits\u2014literally an entire building where people pretty much only sell things like capacitors and MOSFETs. And all of these places have people who know people. That\u2019s their job.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Shenzhen\u2019s technological rise comes with it an uncomfortable omnipresence of CCTV and facial recognition, which feels more fitting today than ever before now that we know worldwide government facial recognition is a big user of AI GPUs. We started the day by meeting up with our translator for the next two days, Raymond, who\u2019s helped us on factory tours for years. Because Uber doesn\u2019t work in China since it uses the Google Maps API and Google is blocked by the firewall, Raymond was also our man with the locally compatible apps to get us places. This became especially important now that even cash is becoming less acceptable by some cafes and restaurants. Everyone\u2019s moved to paying with the WeChat app. With our ride booked, we\u2019re off to see if the wired funds turn into a GPU.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We\u2019re going to go meet our GPU supplier. These guys seemed to understand that we\u2019re media and we wanted to film, but we weren\u2019t 100% sure. So we walked in with the cameras off, and once we established that, we proceeded.\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: We can talk, but please don\u2019t show face, name, or company.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Talking about it is fine. Okay. This is the card. I guess this is the one that I bought.\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: Yes.\r\n\r\nNarrator: From the Hong Kong warehouse, what\u2019s the most common GPU your customers buy?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: Black\u2014uh\u2014GB\u2026 GB\u2026 mayo.\r\n\r\nNarrator: How popular are 5090s versus AI parts like H100 and H200?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: 5090 very popular. AI cards also, but depends on stock.\r\n\r\nNarrator: I heard the 5090D is\u2014Nvidia started making it specifically for here?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: Mhm.\r\n\r\nNarrator: You sent me the RTX 6000. That\u2019s 96 GB, right?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: 96, yes.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What\u2019s the price in your country?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: Do you need to pay the tax fee for\u2026?\r\n\r\nNarrator: Yeah.\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: We buy from the distributor. The agent.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is the most common user AI companies, robotics companies?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: We don\u2019t really sell to users\u2014more like trading companies.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Does anyone buy AMD AI GPUs or AMD high-end?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: Very few. AMD\u2026 mayo.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Intel?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: Intel\u2026 mayo. No. People don\u2019t want it. Support problem.\r\n\r\nNarrator: There\u2019s no restriction?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: Correct. Mayo.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you think Nvidia knows about people buying and selling the banned GPUs in China? Do they try to stop it?\r\n\r\nTrading Company Rep: They know. But\u2014\u201cyou guys can sell it, but we don\u2019t want to know about it.\u201d\r\n\r\nNarrator: Funny. I wonder how many people they see walk out just with a GPU. They definitely shared more than I thought they would, so that was good. It also connects the pieces really well with the professor we spoke to. That guy shared everything new. Now we probably just go basically back to Huaqiangbei. Our next stop is ten minutes away from the hotel. The next one is even more unknown if they\u2019ll talk to us, because I didn\u2019t buy anything from them. I didn\u2019t offer either, and I explained the whole situation. He replied to every single message with \u201cokay, okay, okay,\u201d except for the address. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to talk about, but I can try,\u201d which is maybe a good sign. Hard to gauge until you see him.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We\u2019re not 100% sure where we\u2019re going, but we\u2019ll get there. I think our biggest takeaway is these GPUs are banned for sale into China, and I just walked into an office and bought one. So the efficacy of the ban is maybe questionable. This still tracks with what Dr. Vinci was telling us, which is that the difficulty comes from buying lots and lots of them. But even the people we just bought this from were like, \u201cYeah, if you want more, just ask and we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d The whole concept of this being a thing you cannot own or purchase in China really doesn\u2019t appear to be as strictly true or simple as we might otherwise think. From the surface of an export control or a ban, you\u2019d think you just can\u2019t get it. That\u2019s not the case. You can get it, and it\u2019s not even that much more expensive than what I would have paid in the US. In fact, their RTX 6000 Pros are the same price; they\u2019re actually cheaper after taxes and shipping in the US if you buy it here.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The most important thing we learned here was where to go next. Just like the ants moving the GPUs piece by piece, we\u2019ll have to collect our information piece by piece. Recapping the parts of the hour-long conversation more efficiently and in one language, the company said that some cards have become more difficult to get, but they can still get them. More expensive or not, it is the reason that their job exists. The fact that they texted me a photo of the brand new at the time RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell card\u2014the very same one that we just bought for $8,500 in the US and that was hard to get at home\u2014shows that this company and their distributor are resourceful. Their price is about $8,600 US, which is actually cheaper when factoring in US taxes and shipping. This company isn\u2019t used to a single GPU sale like ours today. It mostly transacts with other trading companies in high volume. They interfaced with a Hong Kong distributor to bring the cards into Shenzhen, moving it across one more border, another ant in the chain. That meant they could connect us with their distributor, who would be familiar, we were told, with where we could find smugglers to talk to. But this company itself neither knew many smugglers directly nor knew many end users. And that\u2019s okay, because each link in this chain will get us one ant closer to the information we need.\r\n\r\n### Part 4 \u2014 The Fence: Vincent, SEG Market, and IC Suppliers\r\n\r\nNarrator: We hopped in a car and drove forty minutes to meet up with a GPU trader we found in Shenzhen. Huaqiangbei is home to the world-famous SEG Market where we\u2019ve found some of the strangest computer parts we\u2019ve ever seen in past videos. It has the highest concentration of technology and integrated circuits and electronics in the world, with a never-ending maze of multiple disconnected multi-story malls specializing in all electronics. If your life depended on getting a complete product made in a single city block, Shenzhen\u2019s Huaqiangbei is your best bet.\r\n\r\nNarrator: This time we\u2019d be with this guy. This is Vincent. His profile picture on a messaging app is Van Gogh, so he has a sense of humor. This guy wheels and deals with dozens of GPU trading companies near the bustling Bay Plaza. He has a reputation around here for being the smooth talker.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Our first impression was that this guy knows people, and they already know him, and that\u2019s what we need.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): He\u2019s pretty open about it. Whatever he knows.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is it difficult to get the GPUs?\r\n\r\nVincent: High-end GPUs\u2014you do it piece by piece.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): He says from Taiwan, one by one. From Hong Kong, too.\r\n\r\nVincent: One by one.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is there any consequence for bringing them in? Does China care or does Hong Kong care?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): In China it\u2019s not a real restriction. It\u2019s more from the US side. Hong Kong is the closest and most common. It\u2019s the easiest to bring it in.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What\u2019s the normal order amount? How many cards does a company normally buy?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): One or two. Single units. Sometimes small batches.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Would you be interested in us following you to SEG if you have any need to go buy stuff? We could accompany you\u2014just to see some of your favorite spots or the most interesting ones.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): He says okay. He can take us.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is it walking distance?\r\n\r\nVincent: Yeah.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Vincent led us over to various large wholesale and consumer retail markets. His office is about ten minutes away from SEG Market, which is his daily haunt.\r\n\r\nNarrator: There\u2019s one peculiar detail in all of this. Vincent has customers both in and outside of China, but his foreign customer base is relatively high. He mostly deals in RTX 4090s, which seems to be a trend, as you\u2019ll see with our smuggler contact at the end of this. That means Vincent is buying 4090s that either never left China but were supposed to, or were likely illegally exported to China, which would mean he is then re-re-exporting them to his foreign customers. It\u2019s like an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nNarrator: He\u2019s an interesting guy. He talked about multiple business ventures in Uganda and Kenya.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): He went to Kenya before. He wanted to go there and start a business. He was looking around to see if there\u2019s any opportunity. The people couldn\u2019t afford it\u2014the things he wanted to sell were out of the market range. Too expensive for the locals.\r\n\r\nNarrator: He used to work as a shopkeeper in the mall itself and would interface with factories or anyone else who wandered in.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): It\u2019s pretty simple to set up a business or start running a company like his. Low cost, and very scattered. He used to own a shop in there.\r\n\r\nNarrator: These days, he\u2019s closed shop and is a buyer instead. He mostly takes orders online, doesn\u2019t keep much inventory, and just walks across the street when an order comes in that day. It\u2019s basically like a concierge GPU pickup service.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Vincent did what he soon learned he does best, which is connect us with people. He brought us to a friend of his who sells Bitcoin mining hardware and GPUs. This is where we learned the relationship. She thought he was bringing us here as customers, so she didn\u2019t want to share his cost with us.\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: It\u2019s up to him to tell you what the price is, and then I\u2019ll tell him the cost.\r\n\r\nNarrator: A 4090?\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: 19,800.\r\n\r\nNarrator: That\u2019s not bad, honestly. That\u2019s pretty close to US pricing\u2014about $2,600. The average price for a 5090 right now in the US is $3,500. It\u2019s actually cheaper than average.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Like with other interviews, we learned that people rarely want AMD and basically nobody wants Intel.\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: AMD\u2014no. Intel\u2014no. Support problem.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): She does what he does. Very similar. He knows her. He started off doing mining machines, so she\u2019s still doing it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We told Vincent that we were getting ready to travel six hours north to check out a GPU repair shop that buys small components for not only repairing broken video cards to keep them in service\u2014especially the expensive banned ones\u2014but also modifying and building new video cards that Nvidia doesn\u2019t make. He said he had an idea for us.\r\n\r\nVincent: Nothing special, but we can go check it out. Protect peace. Protect peace.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): That\u2019s my translation. It is exactly.\r\n\r\nNarrator: That\u2019s like finished goods, and this is like pre-assembled.\r\n\r\nNarrator: This is it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Cool. Wow. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been in here before. This is cool.\r\n\r\nNarrator: MLCCs\u2014capacitors. You find those on GPUs everywhere. SMD\u2014surface mount device. DIP.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): They\u2019re relatives.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Okay. Cool.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): They are selling across different platforms. It\u2019s more like e-commerce.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do they sell on Alibaba also?\r\n\r\nVincent\u2019s Cousin: Yes.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): This is like a central place for a lot of factories to come buy stuff. All the vendor suppliers are here. They just come here and grab this from this guy, grab this from this other store.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Factory usually?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): And repair shops.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Everything is sold online?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): Everything is sold across platforms. As long as they make money, they like it. If they don\u2019t make money, they look for something else. He\u2019s saying Chinese are different\u2014it\u2019s more practical.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Vincent\u2019s cousin connected a missing link for us. People like him selling FETs, inductors, capacitors, resistors, MLCCs, and so on for repair shops can help to supply the parts needed for upfit or modifications for GPUs. Someone doing this kind of work but specializing in video cards might source additional VRAM, for example. He told us about how 5090s are easy to get because the local factories supply them, matching Mr. Five\u2019s comments earlier. Some of the sellers here told us that they\u2019re capable of sourcing devices like A800s or even A100s. They just didn\u2019t have them on site. They have them in a more secure spot. There\u2019s a separate area for the warehousing. Fortunately, we learned where they are from our new friends in SEG. Like every other link in this chain, we\u2019re getting closer to understanding the full story with each person who pours some tea for us.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): He likes chatting or hanging out. They enjoy chatting with different types of people\u2014just to learn from different culture\u2014and they really enjoy that.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We agree, but it was time to head back, because tomorrow we had a morning to kill.\r\n\r\n### Part 5 \u2014 Warehouses: Upstairs Stock and Getting Kicked Out\r\n\r\nNarrator: We had a morning to kill. We wanted to find those warehouses to figure out how many GPUs there are. This seems like the right area. You can breathe hot air on it and it\u2019ll help equalize it. We only had a couple hours before our high-speed rail appointment. SEG\u2019s guards have never been particularly friendly toward filming to begin with, but ultimately they\u2019re not police. The worst that happens is we get asked to leave. Besides, there weren\u2019t any signs saying we couldn\u2019t be there. I mean, I can\u2019t read Chinese, but I assume there weren\u2019t.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Great. The elevator looks promising for the warehouses. Colorful distributor.\r\n\r\nCompanion: What were you thinking?\r\n\r\nNarrator: I was thinking that was like racks and racks. I was imagining that. I think we\u2019ve got our GPUs to the left in these cartons. If they don\u2019t have it, they come here and they buy it from these warehouses which are on the upper floors of the building. They just have cartons\u2014probably a dozen tall and about the same deep\u2014where each one should have five or six cards in it. And then all those feed into SEG and they get distributed to Alibaba sellers like Vincent and then get sent out from there. So it\u2019s a lot of GPUs. Not all of them are banned, but I did see a couple 5090s. Motherboards, too. I just didn\u2019t expect this. It was this kind of secretive. A little bit more mysterious. No lights.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The perspective is amusing. From the perspective of the United States, this floor is filled with highly illegal items. They didn\u2019t have export licenses. From the perspective of people working here, this is just their job. It\u2019s not shady. It\u2019s not some subterranean refuge of firearms. It\u2019s just a poorly lit warehouse like any number of other warehouses around the world. But the perspective of the American government here would be different from people working here. They just want to sell these things and go home. On the other hand, from the perspective of the people working here, we are the shady ones. Walking around filming and specifically trying to not draw attention is not normal. We\u2019re just noticing how nobody cares that we\u2019re here. Nobody gives a [__]. And that is called foreshadowing.\r\n\r\nNarrator: It\u2019s all individual companies. All these doors are different warehouses. Should we go up to four or six?\r\n\r\nCompanion: Six. See what we\u2019ve got.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The feeble electricity. There are a couple GPU cartons in there, too. It was around here that we were asked to stop recording, so we didn\u2019t capture what they said, but it was, \u201cNima, what are you doing?\u201d We smooth-talked our way out of it. We gave our b\u00f9 h\u01ceo y\u00ecsi, and we called it a successful shoot.\r\n\r\nCompanion: What did they say?\r\n\r\nNarrator: They\u2019re like, \u201cYou can\u2019t record in here. You have to get permission to record here.\u201d So we\u2019re like, we\u2019re just documenting what we\u2019re seeing just for fun. Travel vlog. Yeah, travel vlog. Travel vlog.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Raymond, we got kicked out.\r\n\r\nRaymond: Yes, we did.\r\n\r\nNarrator: You did your best to smooth talk them. We just told them that we\u2019re documenting a vlog and walking around. They didn\u2019t really care. They just kind of wanted to make sure that nothing crazy was going on, because they didn\u2019t escort us out. They just walked away.\r\n\r\nCompanion: They were like, \u201cOh yeah, okay. No worries,\u201d and then they walked away.\r\n\r\nNarrator: They were nice about it. They knew we weren\u2019t really doing anything. We\u2019ve learned a lot about GPUs and now we\u2019re back out into Shenzhen, outside of SEG Market and a couple other places. Next up, we\u2019re going to go to Junjo and meet with a repair shop who builds custom 48 GB GPUs. We\u2019ll do that next. Up next, Junjo.\r\n\r\n### Part 6 \u2014 The Chop Shop: Repair Culture and 48 GB 4090 Builds\r\n\r\nNarrator: We regrouped with Raymond and left Shenzhen, heading to the biggest train station any of us had ever been in\u2014Shenzhen Bay, which is a high-speed rail station. For the journey ahead, we had a five-hour-fifty-minute, extremely comfortable high-speed rail ride up to Junjo. The train goes several hundred kilometers per hour, which is good because we had to travel somewhere around 1,700 kilometers to get to where we were going. This ended up taking about the same time as a flight would have taken with all the airports factored in. But the reason we were doing this day trip was to visit Jung\u2019s repair shop\u2014or Brother John\u2019s repair shop. He\u2019s famous for repair on Bilibili. His independent repair shop has some Rossman-like vibes in some ways. He\u2019s got video cards all over the place, spare parts everywhere. He saves everything that he can salvage and then rips the good components off of the boards to reuse them for other ones. But John is an interesting guy in this chain because he\u2019s not directly part of the GPU black market. What he does is fix video cards. He does that for consumers and for companies. Sometimes that means people want him to modify video cards to double the VRAM, for example. That\u2019s where it starts getting into the territory that\u2019s interesting for our movie today.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We\u2019re in Junjo. It\u2019s about 6:00 a.m., scorching hot\u2014about 30\u00b0C already. We just got breakfast. Now we\u2019re going to see our repair shop guy to check out the 48 GB GPUs and see what he knows about the AI GPUs and how they get in. It\u2019s really hot. We\u2019re just walking in the road to get the car. This is how you do it here\u2014or at least this is how Raymond does it here.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We are at John\u2019s repair shop. He\u2019s up there right now working on GPUs. You can see him in the blue vest. We\u2019re going to go in and work with them on counterfeit GPUs and 48 GB 4090s.\r\n\r\nBrother John: Okay.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is it because there aren\u2019t that many 5090s yet that you don\u2019t see many repairs?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): There are some 5090s, but because there aren\u2019t that many, there aren\u2019t that many to repair. The older cards\u2014past warranty\u2014are more common. AMD cards, yes. For Intel, even if someone wants to repair it, they\u2019re unable to because there isn\u2019t enough information or experience.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Are most of the cards that come in local to Junjo, or are they from all over China?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): From all over China through his channel\u2014through Bilibili.\r\n\r\nNarrator: This is cool. This is a schematic. Is it short circuits or missing circuits that you\u2019re chasing?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): For the newest ones it usually takes a while for schematics. For older models, easier.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you ever do GPU swaps?\r\n\r\nBrother John: That\u2019s the easy part.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Really?\r\n\r\nBrother John: It\u2019s a lot easier than diagnosing this kind of board-level failure.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We spent another two hours touring Junga\u2019s shop. It\u2019s pretty amazing. We\u2019ll have a full separate video for that because it\u2019s so damn cool. But the real reason we\u2019re here for this specific topic is to see how these cards are modified. Because if there\u2019s an export ban on GPUs going to China, then it becomes critical for China to be more self-sufficient on keeping those GPUs that they do manage to get in service. Most of the repairs are more typical things you\u2019d expect of soldering. There are board heaters, soldering irons, surface-mount components gathered from suppliers nearby, similar to the one that we saw in Shenzhen, and a lot of test stations. One thing that\u2019s unique to China and especially to this shop is the ability to take an existing model video card and completely modify the SKU into something that Nvidia doesn\u2019t even make. Nvidia is intentionally restrictive with how much RAM it puts on cards. Part of that is to upsell people to more expensive models. At shops like this one, they double the VRAM on some of the cards that come through. It\u2019s a fully custom SKU.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do you have one lying around that you can show us?\r\n\r\nBrother John: I can make one right now.\r\n\r\nNarrator: If it\u2019s not too inconvenient.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): He can do the 24 to 48 GB right now.\r\n\r\nNarrator: I think we\u2019re going to make a 48 GB 4090 right now. This is a 24 GB 4090 that\u2019s been through a lot of repair steps. Up here they track the repair history on the card in order. It\u2019s been through six repair steps. The board\u2019s been through a lot. It originally didn\u2019t work at all, then had a memory problem, then other problems in between. Now it\u2019s actually working. It\u2019s functioning now and you can see it even turns on. It\u2019s a 4090 and it\u2019s got all 24 GB detected. But because this board has been through so much trauma from repairs, it\u2019s better to harvest the expensive components and put them on a new board so they don\u2019t have to worry about it failing again in the future from something else. The next step is going to be to put the extra memory on it to go to 48 GB.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What\u2019s the success rate of the swap?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): Ninety-nine percent. There\u2019s still like a one percent chance of failure.\r\n\r\nNarrator: That\u2019s really good. They\u2019re protecting from static with the cover on the PCIe slot. Now we\u2019re going into the lab.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Because Nvidia doesn\u2019t make a 48 GB 4090, the repair shop has to source its own PCB. It needs something that has enough pads for all the memory modules they\u2019re adding to it. They work with a third-party supplier that builds a PCB, uses an SMT line to place all the VRM components, and has the extra wiring, circuitry, and pads to support 48 GB of memory. That\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at here. It\u2019s a custom board just for this.\r\n\r\nNarrator: First is disassembly. He\u2019s going to take apart the old card. Sometimes people buy 10 or 20 at a time and these go into servers for AI\u2014running models or whatever they\u2019re doing.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Does Nvidia care? This isn\u2019t an official SKU.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): They can\u2019t do anything anyway. It\u2019s aftermarket\u2014like souping up your car. Sometimes Nvidia blocks stuff in firmware or BIOS to try and block a modification.\r\n\r\nNarrator: How long does this step normally take?\r\n\r\nNarrator: He\u2019s heating the GPU to about 260\u00b0C\u2014really similar to what we saw with EVGA\u2014just blasting the GPU with heat. It takes about five minutes and then he\u2019ll be able to pull the GPU off. Now he\u2019s pulling the GPU. It happens really fast. He puts it on a metal stand.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Now they\u2019re using a board heater. There\u2019s a temperature reading on the front\u2014currently at 133\u00b0C\u2014then up to 320\u00b0C. The hot air station is at 396\u00b0C. He\u2019s going to heat the board and then use the hot air station to heat pinpointed memory modules and remove them without risking damage to other components on the board. They keep the original memory modules. He\u2019ll pull these and keep them, and they also have new modules they bought\u2014from Tao, basically\u2014and they\u2019ll add those to the board so they can double the memory capacity.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Now they\u2019re working the reballing process. There\u2019s a template for the solder balls. He\u2019s cleaning with rubbing alcohol, pours solder balls into the stencil, does eight at a time, and bakes the new solder balls onto the memory modules, which they can then attach to the PCB. He\u2019s already applied flux and is wetting the solder balls. Now he\u2019s using a wick\u2014a solder wick\u2014to pull off excess solder and smooth the surface.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What do 48 GB cards normally sell for?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): Twenty thousand RMB\u2014about $2,800 US.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Now they\u2019re adding heat again\u2014hot air at about 390\u00b0C\u2014holding the memory while pressing it into the hot plate, which is at 195\u00b0C. He can only do eight at a time, so he\u2019ll repeat the process.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Is it hard to get 4090s or 5090s for him?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): Customers bring them. He doesn\u2019t actually buy\u2014he just repairs.\r\n\r\nNarrator: It\u2019s crazy how in the US there are a couple shops that can do repairs, but they don\u2019t really do this level of repair. I don\u2019t know of a single shop in the US that does the memory modding.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): Labor cost is a huge issue in the US. For him, it\u2019s worth it. For the customers, it\u2019s worth it. The service cost here is not as high.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Next stage: at this point they\u2019ve reballed all of the memory and the GPU. Now he\u2019s cleaning the surface to prep it to mount to a new PCB. We saw the new PCB earlier\u2014it\u2019s a brand-new custom PCB they just ordered from Tao. He\u2019s adding flux now. As Lewis Rossman says, you can never have enough flux.\r\n\r\nNarrator: There\u2019s a custom template for the GPU just like for the memory. He applies that to the surface, uses a tray to catch the excess, and sifts it. He wipes off the extra and carefully removes the template while leaving the balls in place, held by the flux. This is a jig to hold the GPU in place.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Now the GPU is on there. We\u2019re at the final stage. This whole process is about two hours. Now we\u2019re doing the opposite of earlier\u2014adding the GPU back. He\u2019s very carefully positioning the GPU to precisely align the BGA with the solder balls. He starts to reach steady state on temperature\u2014a couple hundred degrees. There\u2019s a ton of bubbling at the edges, but they\u2019re baking the GPU back on. At this point, the PCB has been swapped. The PCB already had all the VRM components and the I/O populated\u201412VHPWR high power. They\u2019ve added new memory to the front and the back\u2014one side reused, one side brand new\u2014and the GPU has been pulled and swapped and is now being remounted. They\u2019re telling us this is a 99% chance of success.\r\n\r\nNarrator: He\u2019s going to cool it off with a fan. Do they reuse the same cooler that they took off the old board, or do they need a new cooler?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): They reuse. There\u2019s only one choice for the cooler. No options.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Moment of truth. He\u2019s just going to hold the heatsink on and see if it powers on. It\u2019s got a green LED, the display debug up top. We\u2019ve got display up top, so it is functional. Now it\u2019s just a question if everything detects.\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): We\u2019re lucky. Usually it doesn\u2019t turn on the first time in a while. They know we have a train to catch.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Do the customers who buy these mostly put them in servers?\r\n\r\nTranslator (Raymond): If the customer buys multiple units, then it\u2019s probably for servers. That\u2019s why the blower fan would be better\u2014they pack them in so tight. But there\u2019s only one cooler\u2014they don\u2019t really have a choice.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Next step: one of the last steps in the process. Since it booted and worked, they\u2019re pulling the protective film from the thermal pads. There\u2019s a pre-applied paste\u2014it looks like it was silk-screened on there.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Looks like it works. Within two hours, start to finish, we have a working 4090 48 GB. At the beginning of this process, the card was working, but it had been through so many repairs that it was very likely it\u2019d break again at some point from something they couldn\u2019t really predict. From a waste standpoint, it\u2019s way better to figure out a way to save that card because the PCB is kind of the least valuable thing and is also the least precious of the resources. Being able to save the silicon that\u2019s in the memory and in the actual GPU itself\u2014that has a lot of value, especially in China where they just don\u2019t have as much supply. Even though the supply looks pretty damn good from what we saw, it\u2019s still intentionally restricted. Purely from the perspective of the people living there, not only is this better than what Nvidia shipped to begin with and really not that far off in price when it was at its most scalped, it\u2019s also a good way to keep the silicon in circulation even as things like MOSFETs, capacitors, or PCBs die. The silicon tends to be pretty resilient and it doesn\u2019t really die that often on GPUs.\r\n\r\nNarrator: What this tells us is that this is maybe an alternative method to getting more GPUs into supply. If they take the broken boards and then put functional silicon back into circulation, it\u2019s a certain level of ingenuity, and there aren\u2019t many places that are set up to handle it. Brother John\u2019s shop is impressive. After finishing at the repair shop, we rushed over to the high-speed rail, spent six hours traveling back to Shenzhen Bay, adding another thousand miles or so to our travel log here, and then we took a car over to visit the next stop.\r\n\r\n### Part 7 \u2014 Factory: How GPUs Are Assembled and Disappear\r\n\r\nNarrator: After finishing at the repair shop, we rushed over to the high-speed rail, spent six hours traveling back to Shenzhen Bay, adding another thousand miles or so to our travel log here, and then we took a car over to visit this guy. He calls himself the Chinese Eminem. Eminem in China. So, this is Joe. He works as a creative director of product at the video card manufacturer Yeston, most famous for their waifu video cards. You know the ones.\r\n\r\nJoe: Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m the\u2014he\u2014his father.\r\n\r\nNarrator: She\u2019s father.\r\n\r\nJoe: She\u2019s father. Yes. She\u2019s father.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Anything else you want to talk about on camera?\r\n\r\nJoe: I think we got it all. Game natures.\r\n\r\nNarrator: I also have the same nickname.\r\n\r\nJoe: Which one? Yes. Tough guy. Tough guy. All for I will put your head on the ground.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Now, Joe and Yeston were not officially contributing to the black market side of the research here, just to be clear to their own partners. Instead, they showed us around their factory. This will be a separate upload later with an actual factory tour with them showing how the waifus are made. But in this particular video, there were a few interesting things we learned that fit here pretty well. The big takeaway from the factories is that they receive their GPU supply, of course, from their partners\u2014that would be AMD, Intel, or Nvidia\u2014and the memory is often packaged with it. But for the most part, everything else that they use, unless they\u2019re buying reference PCBs, comes from whatever sources they want to find for their supply.\r\n\r\nNarrator: We were also informed that there\u2019s very little oversight in terms of the management of the rejects at these places. They can file for refunds if, for example, a chip is bad. But if they screw up a board in their own process\u2014like the SMT line is miscalibrated and optical inspection doesn\u2019t catch the error and they place a MOSFET on backwards and blow something up\u2014then it\u2019s going to be on them to deal with the defect. This type of thing basically never happens. All of this stuff is highly automated. The point of pointing it out, though, is that for at least the gaming-class cards, which the 5090 more or less is one of, there\u2019s enough volume and Nvidia\u2019s hands-off enough that it would be pretty easy to make these disappear. The biggest reason for this is that there are partners for the 5090s. It\u2019s not like a card that only Nvidia makes, such as the RTX Pro 6000 in the Blackwell edition. And since there are partners, Nvidia is only tracking when they sell them the GPUs. They don\u2019t necessarily keep tabs on where those get distributed once they\u2019re done being manufactured. So, for this reason, if a factory wants to just sell it domestically in China and they think they can get away with it without being added to the entity list, which would very likely kill their business with Nvidia, then they can go ahead and sell them domestically. That might be how some of these trading companies get a hold of them. It\u2019s an easier way to make them disappear than through channels that are more publicly visible from Nvidia and government. Now, Yeston doesn\u2019t make 5090s, but the processes they taught us about illustrate how that could happen.\r\n\r\nNarrator: As for the server-grade solutions, there are manufacturers for those that are pretty tightly controlled. Basically, the silicon is made in Taiwan. It\u2019s shipped to wherever it\u2019s going to be assembled. Almost all of the other components are sourced in China, and as a result, it\u2019s easiest to keep the whole supply chain there, including the assembly. The assembly involves the same stuff you\u2019re seeing for the lower-end cards and the AMD solutions we\u2019re looking at from this factory line. They use surface-mount technology, or SMT lines, with conveyed inflow of PCBs, reels upon reels of components that are placed smallest to largest, with the most valuable typically at the very end\u2014that would be the GPU\u2014and then manual placement for heat sinks. There is often manual assembly even for Nvidia\u2019s high-end stuff. Although we can\u2019t show you that here, we have seen it being made. That\u2019s in different factories.\r\n\r\nNarrator: At the end of the process, it\u2019s possible they find a defect. Again, Dr. Vinci Chow had one where he has a broken link on his board. There\u2019s a good chance that stayed in China and never left. If it was reported as a defect to Nvidia, then it may have effectively just been written off and considered trash. But after seeing how a highly skilled group like Brother John\u2019s repair shop can repurpose all those components that are still good, you can see how there would be value in figuring out a way to make that board disappear, even if it\u2019s supposed to be in the trash. This comes back to Nvidia\u2019s turning a blind eye because they\u2019d eventually notice it from the serial number popping up somewhere, but maybe they choose not to. And besides, once someone has it\u2014especially in China\u2014there\u2019s not a ton they can do anyway. That\u2019s a look inside the manufacturing process, which we felt was an important piece to this story.\r\n\r\n### Part 8 \u2014 Taiwan and Singapore: Intermediaries and Pass-Throughs\r\n\r\nNarrator: My favorite place to go in the world, Taipei, Taiwan. Most of our stay in Taiwan was for other stories. However, we did accidentally unturn one stone with something interesting under it. We can\u2019t show any B-roll for this because we do protect sources, so we\u2019re just showing some other footage instead. A B2B company in Taiwan noted to us that it\u2019s commissioned by Chinese companies to import servers for pre-testing and pre-assembly and setup steps. When we asked what the GPUs were that the servers ran, having just done all the rest of this, we realized that all of the hardware is export controlled. Once the B2B agency completes its testing, it ships the system out to the original buyer. Basically, they act as an intermediary to buy the machine, mark it up, and reship it to the original purchaser, maybe with actual testing. We also spoke with a company that conducts business in Singapore. The company informed us that they are also aware of similar pass-throughs for so-called testing or data services.\r\n\r\n### Part 9 \u2014 The Smuggler: The Plug\u2019s U.S. Operation\r\n\r\nNarrator: Our last link in this chain is actually the first\u2014the smugglers\u2014bringing it full circle. And the smugglers themselves also put us back in the United States. We didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to find someone doing the dirty work here, but in the final hours, a viewer had a lead. This led to about a 12- or 16-hour production delay as we were wrapping the project, but as far as we\u2019re aware, this is the first content piece that actually features someone doing the highest-risk dirty work. Everyone else we spoke to is in China. They\u2019re safe from US retaliation. But large-scale smugglers get arrested, fined millions of dollars, and can spend years in prison if they were really serious.\r\n\r\nNarrator: A viewer contacted us to say that he\u2019d connected with a traveling GPU buyer. The story went that this guy drives around buying specifically RTX 4090s. He doesn\u2019t care about anything else, including 5090s, because those don\u2019t sell as well to China. 4090s are ideal, he told us, because they can be modified into cost-effective 48 GB models like we saw at Brother John\u2019s shop. The smuggler was extremely open with us in text messages written only in Chinese, but wasn\u2019t open to us flying out to him. He did allow us to share this video of his car, though. The Plug, as we call him, has an ATX test bench, motherboard, simple downdraft cooler, and a gigantic battery in the trunk of his Prius. He also has at least one spare license plate in the trunk in addition to the one on the back of his car. We\u2019re not sure why, but better not to ask.\r\n\r\nNarrator: People like The Plug post on Facebook Marketplace and other common online reseller forums looking to buy GPUs, just like anyone else in your city would. The Plug offers $2,000 flat per 4090. It doesn\u2019t matter which model it is. It\u2019s not a bad price. He told us that he then finds ways to get them into China. He recently was scammed out of $5,500 of payments owed by a Hong Kong buyer, and that buyer resells in Hong Kong. He\u2019s been considering hand-carrying the devices in luggage instead. Margin is slim. He makes just under $300 US per GPU profit, but that\u2019s before counting gas, potential hotels as he travels, and time. Our understanding is that some in his shoes will strip the GPU cooler off and ship just the PCB back to China, increasing their margin. Coolers are available in abundance where they\u2019re made, so it can be cheaper to do this than pay for the weight and the size. He sometimes buys entire computers just to take the 4090s out, as that\u2019s what the bounty\u2019s on. He then sells the remaining system back to whoever will buy it. He told us that 5090 prices in China are falling so fast due to oversupply, ironically, that he\u2019d lose money reselling it to China and would do better flipping it to Americans.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The Plug isn\u2019t rich. He seems to be doing okay, but it\u2019s not the type of wealth you might expect for taking such risk. We can\u2019t overstate how important it was to get this piece of the story, as this allowed us to fully complete the chain. And a huge thanks to our anonymous viewer who set that up. Many of the sources we met in Asia during this trip told us they simply don\u2019t know how the GPUs actually get in. Now we know people doing this on a small scale, like The Plug, are unlikely to be caught. But operations transacting millions of dollars\u2019 worth of GPUs would have a harder time getting them out undetected. And that brings us to the end of our travels, but not the end of this piece. We have two more entities to look at, and that\u2019s Nvidia and the US government.\r\n\r\n### Legality: Who Can Buy and Sell, and Where\r\n\r\nNarrator: The legality is simple. This is our understanding of it. There\u2019s no restriction on purchasers, only on sellers the US has control over. Even Americans buying GPUs in China are not violating any laws. It is not restricted. So, we\u2019ll start with selling. The simplest answer to who the sale of GPUs is restricted for is anybody who doesn\u2019t have a specific export license and who would be governed by US law, and Nvidia can\u2019t just bypass it by shipping from a different country instead. It has to do with the sale, not with the shipment location. That includes entities buying from US companies, like European companies, who would be under guidance from both Nvidia and, if they do business with the US, its government. It\u2019s also illegal for anybody in the United States, citizen or not, to sell these GPUs to China, Hong Kong, Macau, or companies in those locations if the seller does not have a re-export license. It is not illegal for a person of any nationality in America to sell a GPU to any non-restricted entity. As for buying, there\u2019s absolutely nothing illegal about for us over here to buy these GPUs, but it\u2019s also not illegal to sell them in China for a Chinese company. The Chinese government doesn\u2019t generally enforce American export laws. Other nations cooperating with the United States might, such as recent arrests in Singapore. But once the GPU is in China, the people in possession of it likely don\u2019t care\u2014buyer or seller, or someone who does both, like GPU dealer Vincent.\r\n\r\nNarrator: The only control over Chinese companies that the US has is the entity list, which would hurt their business prospects with American companies, but only if they care about that. Chinese GPU middleman Sutan Halei in Tianjin landed on the entity list for transacting banned GPUs and being found out. Sutan Halei purchases GPUs from anyone who can get them into China, and then they bid on domestic projects like data center buildouts. The entity list was used to restrict, for example, Deepcool previously, resulting in their American partners ceasing business with them for fear of frozen assets, audits, or collateral bans. So this hurts companies like Deepcool that want to operate in the US, and it even shut down their California office. But for Sutan Halei, they mostly want to do business with other Chinese companies, and so it would have limited impact unless they wanted to expand to do business with Americans. Beyond the entity list, the US really has no control over what happens inside Chinese borders. That means the only point at which a GPU could feasibly be intercepted and a person arrested would be operating in the US or in transit to intermediary countries such as Singapore, which may have their own export laws. The people buying and selling them within China are not breaking any of their own government\u2019s laws, though. And so, we come back to Nvidia.\r\n\r\n### Corruption: Nvidia, Governments, and the Fake News Playbook\r\n\r\nNarrator: At every turn, it really looks like Nvidia is playing all sides. If there\u2019s enough money to be made, anybody is Nvidia\u2019s friend. We think the story of AI GPUs has become a story of corruption between governments and the wealthiest company on Earth.\r\n\r\nNarrator: On April 30th, Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic called on the US government to increase export control restrictions to China. As part of this blog post, Anthropic said the government needs to improve its export enforcement to reduce smuggling. The company cited examples of chips being smuggled with \u201cprosthetic baby bumps\u201d and \u201clive lobsters.\u201d This upset Nvidia because Nvidia doesn\u2019t like restrictions to making money. So Nvidia shot back, seemingly taking a page out of Trump\u2019s playbook. Nvidia essentially called this fake news: \u201cAmerican firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in \u2018bumps\u2019 or \u2018alongside live lobsters.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nNarrator: Except Anthropic isn\u2019t telling tall tales. It\u2019s right. A 2022 video that we uncovered showed a security check at Zhuhai, a port in Guangdong not far from Shenzhen, wherein a woman with a prosthetic baby bump was shown to have been carrying CPUs and iPhones instead. The report made it to customs.gov.cn, stating that she arrived from Macau, a common go-between similar to Hong Kong. This story got international attention in technical media, and we reject the possibility that Nvidia wasn\u2019t aware of it. We found the official Chinese government posting about smuggling from Macau. Imports to most of China are taxed, and so tax evasion coupled with smuggling will increase margin on the electronics rather than sharing it with one of the two governments. If you\u2019re already breaking a US law, it seems some just go for a hat-trick and increase the profits.\r\n\r\nNarrator: As for the lobsters, that\u2019s real, too. We unearthed this official Hong Kong customs website detailing a white van busted driving on the Zhuhai\u2013Macau bridge filled with 280 kg of undeclared live lobsters and, yes, 70 smuggled GPUs, complete with photo evidence. The Hong Kong customs itself calls this \u201csmuggling\u201d and notes a maximum sentence of seven years. Nvidia\u2019s response to call these tall tales is not only defensive but serves to gaslight and grossly mislead, we think, and is tantamount to lying for sake of downplaying reality for its own benefit. But then this is a common Nvidia tactic, including its dishonest approach to reviews that we\u2019ve already detailed in our opinions and its deceptive and, we think, false advertising of the RTX 5070 as being equivalent to an RTX 4090, which is provably and comically false.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Following a July 24th publication by the Financial Times reporting that more than a billion dollars of Nvidia AI chips had been smuggled into China, Nvidia downplayed the issue and stated, \u201cTrying to cobble together data centers from smuggled products is a losing proposition, both technically and economically. Data centers require service and support, which we provide only to authorized Nvidia products.\u201d The last part sounds like something a company selling support would say, and the first part doesn\u2019t really match Nvidia\u2019s whole \u201cthe more you buy, the more you save\u201d thing. If your only option is a useless, insufficient data center or a cobbled-together sufficient data center, then a cobbled-together one is still a winning proposition by comparison. It\u2019s weird for them to pretend that this isn\u2019t worth doing. It\u2019s worth, like, lots of money.\r\n\r\nNarrator: That same day, whitehouse.gov posted an article titled \u201cWhy A to Claim for President Trump\u2019s Visionary AI Action Plan.\u201d Near the top of the post, it highlighted a sycophantic quote from Jensen Huang which read, \u201cAmerica\u2019s unique advantage that no country could possibly have is President Trump.\u201d We would call that sycophantic if it\u2019s about any president.\r\n\r\nNarrator: On August 5th, the US Department of Justice announced that it had arrested two people in California for smuggling \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of sensitive microchips used in artificial intelligence applications\u201d to China. The court documents say the shipments included the Nvidia H100 and the Nvidia RTX 4090. Rather than admit smuggling exists, Nvidia downplayed the situation again and stated this time, \u201cThis case demonstrates that smuggling is a non-starter.\u201d Except that anyone who made tens of millions of dollars before getting caught had a pretty good start\u2014and so did their customers. Nvidia also said, \u201cWe primarily sell products to well-known partners, including OEMs, who help us ensure that all sales comply with the US export control rules.\u201d Nvidia noted that \u201cany diverted products would have no service support or updates.\u201d Again, this is not fully true. Our own sources in this story noted that although something like an HGX system would be hard to service, a standalone PCIe GPU could be parted out and covered under a separate warranty, even in China.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Meanwhile, the US began scrutinizing Nvidia\u2019s technology for getting into China, whether or not the company itself was directly involved. In a bipartisan report called \u201cDeepSeek Unmasked,\u201d a government committee called DeepSeek a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d and said DeepSeek had used Nvidia\u2019s technology. \u201cAI model appears to be powered by advanced chips provided by American semiconductor giant Nvidia and reportedly utilizes tens of thousands of chips that are currently restricted from export to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). NVIDIA designed and manufactured many of these chips to create the most sophisticated possible chip while skirting US export controls. This has allowed these chips to be exported to China as the US government develops stricter restrictions. Since March 2024, it is estimated that Nvidia has produced over 1 million chips for the Chinese market.\u201d The government also examined Nvidia\u2019s significant revenue growth in Singapore compared to China based on SEC filings, particularly in years featuring restrictions. The government questioned \u201cwhether PRC customers are arranging for the diversion of sensitive chips that are reportedly sold through Singapore,\u201d stated because revenue from Singapore had grown from almost nothing since 2020 or 2021. Nvidia has defended its sales to Singapore by stating that \u201ccustomers use Singapore to centralize invoicing while our products are almost always shipped elsewhere.\u201d According to Nvidia, shipments destined to Singapore were only 2% of the company\u2019s total revenue in 2025. But we also know that Singapore has made numerous arrests relating to GPU smuggling, so there appears to be some reason for the concerns whether or not Nvidia itself wants to turn a blind eye to it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Despite the allegations, Nvidia downplayed any smuggling of AI chips. In this video uploaded two months ago from what appears to be either a potato or a VHS tape, Jensen Huang speaks on smuggling.\r\n\r\nJensen Huang: Governments understand that diversion is not allowed. And there\u2019s no evidence of any AI chip diversion.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Except that there is evidence of it\u2014not only in this very movie but in readily available reports online for years now.\r\n\r\nJensen Huang: Our data center GPUs are massive. These are massive systems. The Grace Blackwell system is nearly two tons. And so you\u2019re not going to be putting that in your pocket or your backpack anytime soon. And so these systems are fairly easy to keep track of. But the important thing is that the countries and the companies that we sell to recognize that diversion is not allowed and everybody would like to continue to buy Nvidia technology. And so they monitor themselves very carefully and they\u2019re quite careful about that.\r\n\r\nNarrator: He\u2019s right in that it is much harder to smuggle Grace Blackwell or Hopper HGX-class systems completely. Dr. Vinci Chow\u2019s statements align with this: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get a full HGX system.\u201d But it still happens. At least one of Nvidia\u2019s GPU and server customers in another country told us that they facilitate intermediary transmission to China and, in fact, showed us the server racks on site in their facilities. We weren\u2019t allowed to film them, so this footage is from Computex instead, but we saw them. A separate representative told us that document forgery through third-party countries can also disguise such trans-shipments. One middleman told us earlier that an Nvidia distributor gets parts into China. A down-chain factory\u2014not the one we\u2019re showing right now, in case Nvidia has its famed journal of retaliation out\u2014told us that Nvidia\u2019s QC rejects sometimes end up repurposed and kept in China, salvaging the GPU and the VRAM and scrapping the rest. Dr. Vinci Chow told us that one of his own devices had a defective link on it, contributing to this statement because he acquired said device\u2014it just happens to have a defect.\r\n\r\nNarrator: In one set of statements, Nvidia says that smuggling doesn\u2019t really happen because the export controls work and keep partners in line. But in another statement, Jensen Huang called the US export controls a \u201cfailure,\u201d talking out of both sides of his mouth. He spoke of competing Chinese GPU brands posing a threat to Nvidia: \u201cThe local companies are very, very talented and very determined, and the export control gave them the spirit, the energy, and the government support to accelerate their development. I think all in all, the export control was a failure.\u201d The stakes and the dollar signs for Nvidia had increased. Jensen said Nvidia\u2019s market share in China had dropped from 95% to 50%. In Nvidia\u2019s May quarterly earnings\u2014before the H20 exemption and revenue share\u2014Jensen Huang said the company\u2019s data center business in China was done: \u201cHowever, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry. The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China.\u201d Or as Jensen says, the China market is worth one Boeing. \u201cThe Chinese market in a couple years is probably about $50 billion. The market we\u2019ve left behind is utterly gigantic. $50 billion\u2014just so you have a feeling for that number. $50 billion is like Boeing.\u201d Probably not the best example, but okay.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Let\u2019s look back at the timeline one more time for these export controls on Nvidia, this time highlighting Nvidia\u2019s side of things\u2014its relentless appetite for global domination. The October 7th, 2022 Biden administration export controls had a stated goal of \u201cprotecting US national security and foreign policy interests\u201d by implementing new export controls restricting China\u2019s ability to build high-end semiconductors, including for the development of supercomputers. There was an included goal of staving off the potential for China to develop \u201cnuclear weapons and other military technologies.\u201d Blocking the H100 and A100 led to Nvidia creating an export compliant A800 at about 70% of the speed of an A100 for the Chinese market. A year later, on October 17th, 2023, the US Department of Commerce updated its export compliance and restricted Nvidia\u2019s A800 chip as well, alongside the newer China-targeted H800. Weeks later, on December 6th, 2023, Nvidia told reporters in Singapore that it would be working on another new chip that would comply with the US\u2019s new restrictions.\r\n\r\nNarrator: On July 13th, 2025, which was after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election but a week before he took office, the outgoing Biden administration tightened export controls by introducing national chip caps for many countries except for 18 allies. That\u2019s the AI diffusion rule we spoke of earlier, and it would have gone into effect in May. Nvidia, which had remained relatively quiet about the regulations up until this point, criticized the restriction and made an attempt to appeal to the president-elect: \u201cIt makes no sense for the Biden White House to control everyday data center computers and technology that\u2019s already in gaming PCs worldwide, disguised as an anti-China move. The extreme country cap policy will affect mainstream computers in countries around the world, doing nothing to promote national security, but rather pushing the world to alternative technologies. AI is mainstream computing, ubiquitous and essential as electricity. This last-minute Biden administration policy would be a legacy that will be criticized by US industry and the global community.\u201d Nvidia added, \u201cWe would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the US economy, set America back, and play into the hands of US adversaries.\u201d\r\n\r\nNarrator: This is where in the timeline we\u2019d hit the million-dollar dinner and then the ensuing ban/unban of the H20 chip, but we\u2019ve already covered that. Later that month, on April 30th, Huang said this of Trump: \u201cWithout the president\u2019s leadership, his policies, his support, and very importantly his strong encouragement\u2014and I mean strong encouragement\u2014frankly, manufacturing in the United States wouldn\u2019t have accelerated to this pace.\u201d\r\n\r\nNarrator: A month after the Mar-a-Lago estate dinner, on May 7th, the US Department of Commerce confirmed that it will not implement the AI diffusion rule that Nvidia campaigned against and that was created under the Biden administration. The rule was supposed to go into effect a week later on May 15th. This does not unban GPUs like the H100, 5090, B100, and so on. Following the termination of what was supposed to be a rule to address national security implications, the Department of Commerce, now under President Trump, stated, \u201cThe Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation. We\u2019ll be replacing it with a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance.\u201d Nvidia predictably celebrated this statement and took an America First posture: \u201cWe welcome the administration\u2019s leadership and new direction on AI policy. With the AI diffusion rule revoked, America will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution and create high-paying US jobs, build new US supply infrastructure, and alleviate the trade deficit.\u201d\r\n\r\nNarrator: Later that month, on May 28th, Huang spoke with Mad Money host Jim Cramer:\r\n\r\nJensen Huang: When he rescinded the AI diffusion rule, it was a visionary move. It was a bold move, and he recognizes that there\u2019s an AI race and we\u2019re not alone and he wants America to win.\r\n\r\nNarrator: On June 23rd via Reuters, an official of the US State Department warned of DeepSeek military and intelligence operations and warned of the use of shell companies in Southeast Asia to circumvent export restrictions. The report mentioned that DeepSeek had \u201clarge volumes\u201d of high-end H100 chips which are banned in China. Nvidia didn\u2019t like that and responded to Reuters, stating, \u201cWe do not support parties that have violated US export controls or are on the US entity lists,\u201d also saying, \u201cWith the current export controls, we are effectively out of the China data center market, which is now served only by competitors such as Huawei.\u201d Turning a blind eye to the situation, Nvidia added, \u201cOur review indicates that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 products, not H100.\u201d Three days later, on June 26th, The Information reported that DeepSeek\u2019s next AI model had been delayed due to a shortage of Nvidia AI GPUs in China. This directly contradicts Huang\u2019s comments that export controls, according to him, do not work.\r\n\r\nNarrator: On July 4th, Bloomberg reported that the Department of Commerce was preparing new export controls on Malaysia and Thailand to reduce chip smuggling. Interestingly, Singapore, which now comprises a significant portion of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, was not on that list despite being a known smuggling pass-through. On July 10th, Bloomberg reported that Huang and Trump were scheduled to meet again ahead of the CEO\u2019s planned trip to China. Days later, on July 14th, Nvidia confirmed that it will resume sales of H20 chips to China with Huang stating, \u201cThe US government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start delivery soon.\u201d On the 15th, a CNBC business news anchor said this:\r\n\r\nAnchor: He really just pulled off something that few tech CEOs have managed. He played both Washington and Beijing and he won. Jensen has stayed disciplined and diplomatic with a clear message, and that is Nvidia\u2019s dominance serves America\u2019s interest.\r\n\r\nNarrator: On the 28th, the Financial Times reported that the US Commerce Department was not going to make tough moves to tighten export controls to China. This is in spite of several congressional members warning the administration not to loosen the US export controls for AI GPUs. Several national security experts also voiced concern by sending a letter to the US Commerce Department which read, \u201cWe write to express our deep concern over the recent decision to resume exports of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China. As policymakers and professionals with a background in national security policy, we believe this move represents a strategic misstep that endangers the United States\u2019 economic and military edge in artificial intelligence.\u201d On August 11th, we got the comments about the US potentially allowing Blackwell chips to be sold to China as well for 30% to 50% of a revenue share. And that brings us to today.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Nvidia might have started off as a much more humble company, but it has become a savvy political player in a game that is seemingly pay-to-win. That seems only fitting for a gaming company to be particularly good at pay-to-win games. There\u2019s no one better equipped to play that game than the most valuable company by market cap in the world, now at $4 trillion, led by a man whose net worth is estimated at $148 billion. Nvidia knows when to bite its tongue and how to effectively appeal to the ego of politicians of all parties and all countries. We think Nvidia is playing all sides. We think it\u2019s greedy, manipulative, and carefully employs propaganda, such as its use of this fake news playbook for news which was literally reality. But we don\u2019t think Nvidia has a particular set of beliefs beyond just making more money. We think Nvidia will sell anybody out to make a buck.\r\n\r\n### Signoff: Findings, Methods, and Credits\r\n\r\nNarrator: Nvidia is in the big leagues now. It\u2019s not like the 1080 Ti days. Inside of one month, reportedly paying $1 million to a sitting president, after which followed the unlock of five and a half billion dollars of lost H20 revenue, followed next by a 15% split of that unlock going to the US government, is what raises these new questions of Nvidia\u2019s integrity, but we\u2019ve kind of already talked about that over the last year now.\r\n\r\nNarrator: As for the actual black market side of things and smuggling, that was a cool story. This was crazy exciting to work on. I loved actually being out in the field and meeting all these people. We set up some of it in advance, but a lot of people we met on the ground there, we were able to actually get to the bottom of something. It\u2019s pretty cool. We\u2019ve learned that common methods include factory so-called QC \u201cdefects,\u201d or sometimes real ones, where they repurpose hardware that might otherwise have been written off by\u2014especially\u2014Nvidia as just trash, but people with the right skills can reclaim it. We learned about the other method of hand-carrying items, like with students, or actual smugglers on the ground in the US facilitating the transfer of the GPUs. And of course, we learned about suppliers through third-party countries, among other methods. So we did answer the question that we had going into this, which was all about how these cards get in. Again, we loved working on this story and meeting all of these unique people. Each person played a key role in helping us find the next person and allowing us to complete the first public on-record start-to-finish cataloging of a smuggling pipeline for high-end silicon. Our sincere thanks to everybody who made this possible and appeared on camera with us, including our viewers who funded it.\r\n\r\nNarrator: And a big thanks to my team working on this project. Vitali, Andrew, and Mike spent about a month training Tannon how to use a camera because we needed a camera operator for this trip and he\u2019s a writer. Vitali helmed the overall production organization of the files and cutting of the 12 hours of footage initially. Andrew led the artistic efforts, worked on the new products, did the great scene transitions you saw, and general graphics. Tannon was on the camera and worked with me in Asia for three weeks on the story and during a lot of travel. Tim on the team handled the bulk editing of the informational sections and the timeline for this video. And Ben compiled hundreds of pages of research and worked directly with me throughout the process to figure out what the hell this story was going to be. A thanks to Ryan for doing the Black Market logo as well, and all the other contributions in between, like from Aaron Pauly and Matthew Kachihifi on some of the music contributions.\r\n\r\nNarrator: Thanks for watching.

GN mapped roles along the chain (\u201csource \u2192 plug \u2192 mule \u2192 middleman/warehouse \u2192 fence \u2192 fixer \u2192 user\u201d) and documented each link with interviews and field visits across Hong Kong, Shenzhen/Huaqiangbei (SEG Market), Taiwan, Singapore, and the US. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Retail visibility in Hong Kong**: banned gaming GPUs (e.g., RTX 5090/4090) were openly offered in shops as \u201cparallel imports,\u201d with price premiums but ready availability; supply commonly traced to Australia/Thailand/Taiwan and student hand-carry.  \n- **Warehousing in Shenzhen\u2019s orbit**: GN filmed floors of small \u201cupstairs\u201d warehouses feeding the markets with cartons of GPUs; traders emphasized **piecemeal ingress (\u201cants moving house\u201d)** rather than bulk shipments.  \n- **Intermediary pass-throughs**: B2B firms in **Singapore and Taiwan** pre-assemble or \u201ctest\u201d systems containing export-controlled accelerators before re-shipping to final Chinese buyers.  \n- **A US link (\u201cThe Plug\u201d)**: a US-based buyer drives city-to-city offering flat rates (~$2,000) for RTX 4090s, testing in a car rig and exporting PCBs/coolers separately to improve margins; reported profits are thin (~$300/card before costs) but scale accrues.  \n- **Factory leakage & QC salvage**: because **assembly of many Nvidia boards occurs in China**, GN\u2019s sources described \u201cfalling off the line\u201d scenarios and **QC-reject repurposing**; serializable silicon and VRAM are salvaged while PCBs/VRMs are replaced.  \n- **Aftermarket \u201cfixers\u201d upgrade cards for AI**: GN filmed a shop that routinely **converts RTX 4090s from 24 GB to 48 GB** on custom PCBs via reballing\u2014creating SKUs Nvidia doesn\u2019t offer but that are attractive for LLM fine-tuning.  \n- **University demand & constraints**: Hong Kong researchers reported **VRAM capacity** (not raw FLOPS) as the gating metric, finding H20 (96 GB) attractive; export controls hinder **very large-scale clusters** but not small/medium research use.  \n- **Policy mechanics are leaky and whipsawing**: GN walks through **TPP/perf-density thresholds**, later **opaque memory-bandwidth caps**, rescinded \u201cdiffusion\u201d proposals, and the **limited license/revenue-share carve-out** for H20/MI308\u2014highlighting how vendors tune SKUs around shifting rules.  \n- **Corporate stance**: GN characterizes Nvidia as \u201cturning a blind eye,\u201d juxtaposing the company\u2019s public minimization of diversion with evidence of smuggling arrests and visible gray-market activity; GN frames this as incentive-aligned behavior under massive revenue pressure.\n\n## What it means (my assessment)\n\n### 1) Export controls constrain **scale**, not **access**\n- **Efficacy:** The controls appear effective at **preventing super-scale (e.g., 10k\u2013100k GPU) clusters** by raising coordination risk, warranty gaps, and logistics frictions for full HGX racks.  \n- **Inefficacy:** They do **not** prevent **retail-through-meso-scale access**. Ant-trail logistics, student hand-carry, modular shipments (PCBs/coolers split), and third-country pass-throughs deliver a steady trickle sufficient for labs, SMEs, and provincial data centers.\n\n**Net effect:** China\u2019s **peak compute** is slowed; its **broad access** is not. That is a partial strategic success, not a blockade.\n\n### 2) Policy design choices inadvertently **privilege VRAM-heavy, lower-FLOPS** parts\n- FLOPS-oriented thresholds (later tweaked) pushed vendors toward **H20-style** specs: **lower tensor throughput, very high VRAM**\u2014exactly what LLM fine-tuning/inference needs in multi-GPU topologies.  \n- Opaque bandwidth caps add uncertainty, but **capacity is king** for many workloads; consequently, **smuggling + aftermarket VRAM doubling** blunt the intended performance ceilings by substituting memory for raw TOPS.\n\n**Net effect:** Rules aimed at \u201cspeed\u201d leave a hole for **capacity-driven AI** use; expect further rule iterations to target **HBM capacity**, **IO fabric**, and **attestation-gated firmware** rather than FLOPS alone.\n\n### 3) Controls catalyze **domestic substitution & ecosystem hardening**\n- By making Nvidia unreliable for sovereign planning, controls **accelerate** Huawei/others and sustain a **repair/mod industry** that lengthens asset lifetimes and increases self-reliance.  \n- CUDA moat persists short-term, but **PyTorch ROCm**, **OpenXLA**, and **framework portability** efforts gain policy tailwinds when access to CUDA is politicized.\n\n**Net effect:** Short-run frictions; **medium-term diversification** with still-material performance gaps vs. Nvidia.\n\n### 4) Corporate/governance risk\n- GN\u2019s reporting strengthens the case for **tighter serial-level provenance**, **export attestation**, **RMA/warranty gating by region & chain-of-custody**, and **transshipment enforcement** (esp. for HK, SG, MY, TH).  \n- Nvidia faces **reputational and regulatory pressure** if legislators treat \u201cblind eye\u201d narratives as credible; expect more **entity-list expansions** and **compliance audits** of distributors and SI partners.\n\n**Net effect:** Vendors likely move to **cryptographically enforced device activation**, per-region firmware, or **data-center attestation** (with real costs and collateral damage for legitimate refurb/repair).\n\n### 5) Market/pricing\n- The investigation shows Hong Kong retail **price premiums but not scarcity**\u2014implying **elastic gray-market supply**.  \n- Smugglers\u2019 **thin margins** mean the trade is **volume-sensitive** and **enforcement-sensitive**\u2014small crackdowns raise risk cost and can whipsaw availability.\n\n**Net effect:** Expect **periodic volatility** rather than persistent droughts.\n\n## Strengths & limits of GN\u2019s work (objectivity check)\n\n**Strengths**\n- **Direct evidence chain** from US buyer \u2192 HK/China traders & warehouses \u2192 mainland fixer \u2192 institutional users.  \n- **Method triangulation**: filmed purchases, price quotes, physical warehouses, factory context, and university cluster ops\u2014rare in tech reporting.\n\n**Limitations / caveats**\n- Some claims (e.g., factory \u201cfall-off-the-line\u201d) rely on **anonymized sources** and are **inherently hard to quantify**.  \n- **Selection bias**: Shenzhen/HK markets are outliers in visibility; findings may **overrepresent** availability relative to other regions.  \n- **Causality vs. correlation** in the political timeline: GN\u2019s \u201cplaying all sides/corruption\u201d frame is **editorial**; the factual substrate (policy whiplash; carve-outs) is real, but motive inference remains **contestable**.  \n- **Performance claims** for modified cards (e.g., 48 GB 4090) aren\u2019t benchmarked here; **stability, yield, thermals, and ECC absence** matter for production AI.\n\n## Forward look \u2014 what changes next\n- **Enforcement migrates to the edges**: expect **more transshipment arrests**, **controlled-goods audits** in HK/SG/MY/TH, and closer **parcel analytics** for \u201cparts-only\u201d shipments.  \n- **Device-level controls**: **activation servers**, **CC-mode + attestation** as preconditions for driver updates/warranty, and **RMA segregation** by jurisdiction.  \n- **Metric shift**: regulators pivot from FLOPS to **VRAM/HBM capacity, interconnect bandwidth (NVLink/PCIe-Gen5/6, IB-NDR/XDR)** and **rack-level caps**.  \n- **Ecosystem response**: more **ROCm/Ascend** maturation; **LLM pipelines** optimized for **memory-frugal training (LoRA, MoE, 4/8-bit)** to fit within permitted SKUs.  \n- **Repair/mod formalization vs. crackdown**: either tacit tolerance as a circular-economy valve or tighter **custom-PCB/BIOS** controls and **marketplace policing**.\n\n## Bottom line\nGN convincingly demonstrates that **smuggling and gray-market diversion are real, routine, and structurally embedded**, and that **US export controls have shifted from \u201cdeny access\u201d to \u201cdampen scale.\u201d** The investigation also shows how **market incentives (VRAM-first AI), policy instability, and globalized assembly** create durable leakage paths that are hard to close without **device-level attestation and transshipment enforcement**\u2014both of which carry costs for legitimate users and refurbishers. The piece\u2019s **hard findings** (pipeline, availability, aftermarket upgrades, intermediaries) are strong; its **normative claims** about Nvidia\u2019s intent are plausible but **not dispositive**, and will likely be litigated in policy and press rather than in court."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":499,"end_ix":520,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"GN.md","id":"file-HiLD3n4uVryWHcPswq3k7L","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":8,"cited_message_id":"767bcf36-e732-438f-9738-0497f3a411e1","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}}],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":499,"end_idx":520,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"GN.md","id":"file-HiLD3n4uVryWHcPswq3k7L","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":null,"journal_name":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"767bcf36-e732-438f-9738-0497f3a411e1","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null}],"request_id":"974620749b7f5f3f-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"3d6127e0-85aa-4220-a2a2-017f052cfe36","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"3d6127e0-85aa-4220-a2a2-017f052cfe36","children":[]}}}
