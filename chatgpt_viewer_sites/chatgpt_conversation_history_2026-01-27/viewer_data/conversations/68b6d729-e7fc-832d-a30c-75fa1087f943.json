Notice the political tightrope he (and the Singapore Government) is walking.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Immediate recognition of a Palestinian state may not help the Palestinian cause: Shanmugam\r\n\r\nSeveral conditions would need to be met including having a viable government, said Singapore's Coordinating Minister for National Security. \r\n\r\n02 Sep 2025 02:16PM\r\n(Updated: 02 Sep 2025 06:03PM)\r\n \r\nSINGAPORE: The immediate recognition of a Palestinian state would not change \u201cthe facts on the ground\u201d in favour of the Palestinians, and could likely harm them instead, said Coordinating Minister for National Security K Shanmugam on Tuesday (Sep 2). \r\n\r\nHis remarks came amid recent plans by Australia and G7 members Canada, France and the UK to recognise Palestine at the next United Nations General Assembly later this month. \r\n\r\nMore than 140 out of 193 UN member states recognise a Palestinian state. The United States does not; and in Asia, Japan, Singapore and South Korea also do not formally recognise Palestine as a sovereign state.\r\n\r\nSingapore has said since at least last year that it is \u201cprepared in-principle\u201d to recognise a Palestinian state, and that it would do so at an appropriate time. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, Mr Shanmugam said: \u201cYou have to ask whether recognising Palestine very immediately, where there is no viable government and there is no viable two-state solution, hurts or advances the Palestinian cause.\r\n\r\n\u201c(If) you recognise - what counter actions do you expect, and how do you think that it's going to actually change facts on the ground?\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"My suggestion to you is it's not going to change it in favor of the Palestinians. It's likely to harm them.\" \r\n\r\nHe was speaking at the Middle East Institute's annual conference, in response to a question on what it would take for more countries including Singapore to recognise a Palestinian state.\r\n\r\nMr Shanmugam said three conditions need to be met: There needs to be a physical space, which Israel is \u201cdoing its best to prevent\u201d; a population, though \"current actions seem designed to destroy\" a large number of the population or move them out of Gaza; and a viable government. \r\n\r\n\u201cWhat it really needs is support in the Palestinian Authority, giving them legitimacy and building them up to a stage where they can govern,\u201d said Mr Shanmugam, referring to the government body which partially rules the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut again, the fact on the ground, I think, prevents the international community from doing that.\u201d \r\n\r\n\"GROWING FEELING\" IN SINGAPORE \r\n\r\nThe situation in the Middle East has also affected Singapore, including through the rising threat of radicalisation, said Mr Shanmugam.\r\n\r\nHe said Muslim communities in the region are paying greater attention to the events unfolding in Palestine, and are angry about it. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe transition from that to people wanting to do something violent about it, either by going over to the Middle East or doing something in Singapore, we have seen some of it,\u201d he said, citing how a handful of youths as young as 16 have been detained over their radical ideologies. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe fact that, you know, they\u2019re picking up 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds, tells you that there is a growing feeling,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"That is the threat of terrorism, and people wanting to take things into their own hands.\"\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, he was also asked a few times about the role of the US in the Israel-Palestine conflict.\r\n\r\nThe minister said the US was probably the only country in a position to dictate Israel\u2019s actions. \r\n\r\n\u201cNevertheless, the United States has not taken any action, as far as I can tell, any significant action to prevent or change Israel\u2019s cause of action or trajectory,\u201d he added. \r\n\r\nHe also questioned if countries like Singapore or even larger countries could \u201covercome\" American viewpoints \"set in concrete\u201d over decades, one of which was to \u201cfundamentally to go along with almost anything that Israel does\u201d. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not realistically a believer that we can alter that course,\u201d said Mr Shanmugam. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Israel's actions in Gaza have gone too far and will probably be judged harshly by history: Shanmugam\r\n\r\nMr Shanmugam reiterated Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's earlier comments that Israel's actions in Gaza may be a \u201clikely breach of international humanitarian law\u201d. \r\n\r\n02 Sep 2025 03:32PM\r\n(Updated: 02 Sep 2025 06:06PM)\r\n \r\nSINGAPORE: History will likely be harsh in its judgment of Israel's actions in Gaza, said Coordinating Minister for National Security K Shanmugam on Tuesday (Sep 2). \r\n\r\n\"Looking at it today, I think there seems to be, at least at where the levers of power are in Israel, a desire to take actions which will prevent a Palestinian state,\" he said during a speech at the Middle East Institute's annual conference.\r\n\r\n\"And Israeli leaders, some of them, now categorically reject a two-state solution.\" \r\n\r\nMr Shanmugam, who is also Home Affairs Minister, reiterated Prime Minister Lawrence Wong\u2019s comments in May that Israel's actions in Gaza may be a \u201clikely breach of international humanitarian law\u201d. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe have made it very clear several times that, at least as of now, Israel's response has gone too far,\u201d said Mr Shanmugam.\r\n\r\n\u201cMany, including I, think that history will probably be harsh in its judgment of Israel's actions.\"\r\n\r\nLast month, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Israel\u2019s plans to expand military operations in Gaza, describing the move as \u201cdangerous and unacceptable\u201d.\r\n\r\nMr Shanmugam added on Tuesday that Singapore has consistently supported the right for Palestinians to have a homeland, based on a two-state solution. \r\n\r\nWhile it is difficult to see at present any viable pathway, it is the only way a comprehensive, just, durable solution to the conflict can be achieved, he said. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Palestinians deserve no less, so we have to hold out hope.\u201d \r\n\r\nTIES WITH ISRAEL\r\n\r\nMr Shanmugam was also asked at the conference if downgrading or breaking off relations with Israel, as a show of disapproval, was an option for Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe said that this may not help the Palestinian cause, as well as being inconsistent with Singapore's approach to other countries involved in humanitarian crises elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay we cut off ties with Israel, how is that going to help the people of Gaza? How will that give us any hope of continuing to speak with the Israeli government and putting forward our viewpoints?\u201d Mr Shanmugam asked. \r\n\r\nHe said that while Singapore was not the most significant player, it was also \u201cnot completely insignificant\u201d in the eyes of Israel, because of the long relations between the two. \r\n\r\n\u201cThey do listen, as long as we are sensible. It doesn't mean they follow; but at least they listen.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe then pointed to how Singapore has not cut off ties with countries involved in civil conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Myanmar; nor the Russia\u2013Ukraine war.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you want to cut off ties with Israel, you should be cutting off ties with Russia, and on the basis of what I just outlined, you should be cutting off ties with the United States, France, Britain; all of whom have been supplying weapons to many of these conflicts,\" said Mr Shanmugam.

U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Miroslav Jenca warned the U.N. Security Council such actions could have catastrophic outcomes, especially for hostages still held in Gaza, and emphasized Gaza's role in a future Palestinian state under international law. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly favors a full military takeover of Gaza, fueling these concerns. China's deputy U.N. envoy urged Israel to halt aggressive actions and called for an immediate ceasefire, with support from influential countries.\n\nMeanwhile, tension surrounds international efforts toward recognizing Palestinian statehood. Israel's Foreign Minister condemned moves by several nations (including France, Canada, and Britain) to recognize a Palestinian state as undermining hostage negotiations and prolonging the war. At the same time, the U.S. criticized a recent U.N. conference backing a two-state solution as counterproductive.\n\nIn a poignant appeal, Ilay David, the brother of a hostage seen in a disturbing Hamas video, urged the Security Council to act swiftly for the hostages\u2019 release and ensure aid reaches them, warning of dire consequences with each delay.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754433868.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-recognise-palestinian-state-united-nations-september-2025-08-11/","title":"Australia to recognise Palestinian state at United Nations in September","snippet":"Australia announced it will formally recognize the State of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that this move aligns with international momentum advocating for a two-state solution, a ceasefire in Gaza, and the release of hostages, especially following similar recognitions by France, Britain, and Canada. Australia's recognition comes with assurances from the Palestinian Authority that Hamas will not be involved in a future Palestinian state. The decision follows criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration, particularly regarding plans for military control of Gaza and expanding settlements. Foreign Minister Penny Wong notified U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, although the U.S. and Israel have criticized the decision. Albanese emphasized that political solutions, not military ones, are essential to ending violence in the region. The recognition also allows Australia to independently aid reconstruction efforts in Gaza and engage in bilateral treaties. The move has been positively received by Palestinian representatives and former Australian officials, while prompting New Zealand to reexamine its stance. The ongoing conflict has resulted in significant casualties and humanitarian crises in Gaza.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754898301.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b6d75e21fc8007a659ccf11e62ae84","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Critical Analysis of K.

A 15-year-old girl was apprehended in February for planning to join the terrorist group ISIS, while a 17-year-old boy was detained in March for targeting mosques with the intention of committing acts of violence.

The statements came amid mounting global pressure on Israel to ease its 11-week siege on Gaza, which has resulted in severe shortages of food, fuel, and aid for over two million Palestinians, many of whom are starving. Wong reiterated that Australia has provided over $100 million in humanitarian aid, much of which has been obstructed by Israeli forces. Calls for concrete action have intensified from the Palestinian delegation in Australia and political figures like UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who suspended trade talks with Israel over the offensive. Though Australia joined a 24-country appeal for unhindered humanitarian access, it has not yet matched Britain's sanctions or trade suspension. Far-right Israeli ministers have escalated rhetoric supporting continued military operations and displacement, sparking international condemnation. Gaza's health ministry reported over 53,000 Palestinians killed since October 2023, as the humanitarian situation deteriorates rapidly. Calls continue for Australia to impose sanctions and end arms trade with Israel in response to the escalating crisis.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1747808692.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jul/27/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-richard-marles-aukus-defence-talisman-sabre-israel-gaza-ntwnfb","title":"Wong calls withholding aid from civilians 'morally' wrong - as it happened","snippet":"On 27 July 2025, Australia\u2019s political and international landscape was marked by intense focus on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared Israel\u2019s blocking of food aid to Gaza a breach of international law, a stance strongly supported by Foreign Minister Penny Wong, emphasizing the moral imperatives involved. Protests erupted nationwide in support of Palestinians, while DFAT confirmed two Australians were aboard an aid vessel seized by Israeli forces.\n\nDomestically, Albanese distanced the easing of US beef import restrictions from political maneuvering, amid speculation about links to recent U.S. trade tensions. The government remained undecided on including YouTube in a potential social media ban targeting youth.\n\nEconomically, upcoming inflation data is poised to shape Reserve Bank interest rate decisions. Meanwhile, the housing market remains resilient, and Sydney\u2019s Callan Park remains entangled in development debates. NSW Police were lauded for their life-saving organ transport efforts, and multiple incidents drew public concern, including a fatal racing accident, a sunken vessel mystery, and a successful alpine rescue of lost hikers.\n\nAdditionally, Hong Kong\u2019s arrest warrant for Australian academic Feng Chongyi drew sharp rebuke as political persecution, while consultations and treaty spending sparked

In Mariupol, Russian troops have reportedly encircled the city as Ukrainian officials tried to defend crucial areas. Outside Southeast Asia, countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines are urgently working to evacuate their citizens from Ukraine. Oil prices have surged past $110 per barrel despite an agreement to release 60 million barrels of reserves to temper prices. In the U.S., President Biden condemned Russia's actions in his State of the Union address, advocating further sanctions and measures to hold Russia accountable, including shutting US airspace to Russian flights. Simultaneously, major U.S. companies like Apple and Boeing have curtailed their operations in Russia. The conflict has led to significant displays of international support for Ukraine, with various governments imposing sanctions on Russia and showing readiness to accept Ukrainian refugees.

Twenty-two entities connected to the Zimenkov network have been targeted. The Treasury Department used an April 2021 executive order as the basis for these actions, coordinated with the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs Task Force. Authorities believe these sanctions complicate and increase the costs for Russia\u2019s military resupply efforts. The sanctions are part of broader measures to enforce restrictions against Russia\u2019s defense sector and its supporters. As the first anniversary of the invasion approaches, Russia is reportedly preparing for an offensive in eastern Ukraine, while Ukraine seeks additional Western military aid and has secured pledges for advanced battle tanks from several Western nations.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1675269715.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Singapore_relations","title":"Russia\u2013Singapore relations","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756797988.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b6d75e21fc8007a659ccf11e62ae84","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Analyzing Singapore's Diplomatic Actions and Sanctions","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"978cb86e9e43fd9a-SYD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"6d86ea25-bd17-4625-81fd-aacbaed283f2","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6d86ea25-bd17-4625-81fd-aacbaed283f2","children":["df9cfbad-d0f4-48a8-a39a-065bce8ae7ba"]},"df9cfbad-d0f4-48a8-a39a-065bce8ae7ba":{"id":"df9cfbad-d0f4-48a8-a39a-065bce8ae7ba","message":{"id":"df9cfbad-d0f4-48a8-a39a-065bce8ae7ba","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756813253.45889,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"Singapore humanitarian aid to Gaza 2023 2024 Singapore Red Cross government donation amount 505,000 2023 statement\"}, {\"q\": \"MFA statement humanitarian aid Gaza Singapore 2025 July denial of aid violation international humanitarian law\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"Singapore humanitarian aid to Gaza 2023 2024 Singapore Red Cross government donation amount 505,000 2023 statement"},{"type":"search","q":"MFA statement humanitarian aid Gaza Singapore 2025 July denial of aid violation international humanitarian law"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching Singapore's humanitarian aid to Gaza 2023","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"978cb86e9e43fd9a-SYD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"1e3315fd-4a3e-4c9b-8747-09663730c3ce","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"1e3315fd-4a3e-4c9b-8747-09663730c3ce","children":["9b28c316-7824-4cdb-bd7d-af5bebfae002"]},"9b28c316-7824-4cdb-bd7d-af5bebfae002":{"id":"9b28c316-7824-4cdb-bd7d-af5bebfae002","message":{"id":"9b28c316-7824-4cdb-bd7d-af5bebfae002","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1756813259.4521444,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.straitstimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-red-cross-pledges-205k-for-relief-efforts-amid-israel-hamas-war","title":"S'pore Red Cross and Govt pledge $505k for relief efforts ...","snippet":"Oct 16, 2023 \u2014 SINGAPORE \u2013 The Singapore Government and Singapore Red Cross (SRC) have pledged a total of $505,000 in humanitarian aid to support relief ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.straitstimes.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-calls-for-immediate-gaza-ceasefire-amid-unconscionable-civilian-suffering","title":"Singapore says prolonged suffering of civilians in Gaza is ' ...","snippet":"Jul 24, 2025 \u2014 Permanent forced displacement is a further violation of international humanitarian law,\u201d said the MFA spokesperson.

Over 60 aid delivery requests were denied in July alone. Oxfam said Israel obstructed $2.5 million of its supplies, while Care reported $1.5 million in vital resources\u2014food, medicine, and hygiene kits\u2014were barred since March. Aid is reportedly stranded in warehouses in Jordan and Egypt amid growing famine and malnutrition in Gaza\u2019s two million-strong population, exacerbated by nearly two years of conflict and a full blockade reinstated in March 2025.\n\nIsrael defends its new aid regulations, which require detailed information from NGOs for security purposes. Those failing to comply face expulsion of international staff. Israel claims 20 registered groups\u2014including the UN and WHO\u2014are delivering aid daily and accused non-compliant NGOs of potentially aiding Hamas. The new rules have drawn criticism from EU countries and allies, who caution that restrictions worsen the humanitarian crisis.

This move aligns Belgium with over 140 countries, including several European nations, that support Palestinian statehood. The official announcement is scheduled for September 9 at the United Nations General Assembly. However, Belgium's recognition is contingent upon two conditions: the release of all Israeli hostages held in Gaza and the removal of Hamas from political power. Pr\u00e9vot also revealed plans to ban goods from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and designate certain Hamas leaders, violent settlers, and far-right Israeli ministers as persona non grata. This development adds to growing international pressure on Israel amid its military operations in Gaza. While France and the UK are also moving toward recognition, many countries, including Australia and Canada, tie recognition to reforms within the Palestinian Authority, which faces criticism for corruption and governance issues. Israel, staunchly opposed to Palestinian statehood, criticized Belgium\u2019s stance, with strong rebukes from far-right Israeli ministers. The issue continues to strain diplomatic relations within the EU and beyond.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756807465.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-putin-china-visit-europe-live-news-updates","title":"Europe live: Putin claims he never opposed EU membership for Ukraine but draws line at Nato","snippet":"On September 2, 2025, European political developments centered on Ukraine, Russia, and broader geopolitical tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a visit to Beijing where he met Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, claimed Russia never opposed Ukraine\u2019s EU membership but reiterated that Ukraine joining NATO remains unacceptable. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized increasing threats from Russia, underscoring urgency in providing Ukraine with long-term security guarantees. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is set to meet key EU and NATO leaders in Paris for discussions on these guarantees.\n\nIn other major developments, France ordered actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu to stand trial for a 2018 rape allegation, following an earlier suspended sentence for unrelated sexual assaults. In Ukraine, reports emerged that a suspect in a lawmaker\u2019s murder admitted the act was motivated by personal revenge, not Russian collaboration. GPS jamming in Bulgaria, allegedly linked to Russia, disrupted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s flight, prompting concern from NATO leaders.\n\nBelgium announced it will recognize Palestine at the UN General Assembly and impose sanctions on Israel, driving EU diplomatic debates. Finally, tension within the EU emerged over Hungary\u2019s opposition to Ukraine and Moldova\u2019s EU accession process, while leaders warned of a prolonged and precarious European security landscape.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756812677.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/24/france-to-recognise-palestinian-state-at-un-general-assembly-macron-says","title":"France to recognise Palestinian state at UN general ...","snippet":"Jul 24, 2025 \u2014 France will recognise a Palestinian state in September at the UN general assembly, Emmanuel Macron has said.

Both Israel and the U.S. argue that Macron\u2019s recognition could fuel tensions and anti-Semitism, further complicating the peace process. Washington firmly backs Israel's opposition to the unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood. The move has further strained diplomatic ties between France and its traditional allies, with critics expressing concern that it may destabilize the region and hinder peace efforts.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756618619.0,"attribution":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"commonslibrary.parliament.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10323/","title":"UK, Canada, France statements on recognising a Palestinian ...","snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 In July 2025, the French, Canadian, and UK governments announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state at the next UN General Assembly meeting ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"commonslibrary.parliament.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-statement-on-the-middle-east","title":"Foreign Secretary statement on the Middle East","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756681200.0,"attribution":"www.gov.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/we-are-determined-to-protect-the-viability-of-the-two-state-solution-foreign-secretary-statement-at-the-un-two-state-solution-conference-on-gaza-and","title":"Foreign Secretary statement at the UN Two-State Solution ...","snippet":"Jul 29, 2025 \u2014 And so, it is with the hand of history on our shoulders that His Majesty's Government therefore intends to recognise the State of Palestine when ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753743600.0,"attribution":"www.gov.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.aljazeera.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/30/canada-will-recognise-palestinian-state-at-un-general-assembly-carney","title":"Canada will recognise Palestinian state at UN General ...","snippet":"Jul 30, 2025 \u2014 \u201cCanada intends to recognise the State of Palestine at the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025,\u201d Carney told ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753912607.0,"attribution":"www.aljazeera.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.fdd.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/07/25/frances-macron-announces-intent-to-recognize-palestinian-state/","title":"France's Macron Announces Intent to Recognize ...","snippet":"Jul 25, 2025 \u2014 ...

He frames \u201cappropriate timing\u201d around viability and rebuilding the PA\u2019s legitimacy. \ue200cite\ue202turn14search2\ue201  \n- **Sharp censure of Israel\u2019s conduct.** He says Israel\u2019s response \u201chas gone too far,\u201d may amount to breaches of IHL (echoing PM Lawrence Wong), and will \u201cprobably be judged harshly by history.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn10search7\ue201  \n- **On leverage:** Only the US can truly move Israel; others (including Singapore) have limited ability to alter its trajectory. \ue200cite\ue202turn14search2\ue201  \n- **On cutting ties:** Severing or downgrading relations with Israel would neither help Gazans nor be consistent with Singapore\u2019s approach to other conflicts; staying engaged preserves a channel to press views. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n## The tightrope Singapore is walking\n1) **Normative signalling vs. practical constraints.** Singapore has condemned Hamas\u2019 Oct 7 terror attacks and called for hostages\u2019 release; at the same time it has increasingly criticised Israeli conduct and denial of aid as violating IHL, while pushing a two-state end-state. That mix aims to keep Singapore on the legal/moral high ground without abandoning engagement. \ue200cite\ue202turn15search0\ue202turn15search1\ue202turn14search14\ue202turn14search7\ue201\n\n2) **Domestic cohesion and security.** Authorities have repeatedly warned about radicalisation spillovers; ISD cases in 2024\u201325 include youths and adults radicalised in part by the Gaza war. That domestic risk helps explain the government\u2019s careful rhetorical calibration and its emphasis on law-and-order messaging alongside humanitarian concern. \ue200cite\ue202turn18search4\ue202turn18search1\ue201\n\n3) **Strategic relationships.** Singapore\u2019s historic security ties with Israel are real; at the same time, most ASEAN and many Muslim-majority partners recognise Palestine. The government is trying to condemn conduct, maintain channels, and avoid actions that rupture long-standing defence/diplomatic linkages. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search4\ue201\n\n4) **Timing relative to major powers.** France, the UK and Canada have announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state at the UNGA in September; Australia has similarly signalled a shift. Singapore is signalling \u201cprepared in principle\u201d but \u201cnot yet,\u201d pending viability\u2014an explicit hedge as G7 positions evolve. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search5\ue202turn13search24\ue202turn13search8\ue202turn0news36\ue201\n\n## Strengths of his position\n- **Consistent with Singapore\u2019s small-state, legalist foreign policy.** The emphasis on IHL, two-state solution, and practical viability aligns with long-stated positions and with MFA\u2019s recent language on aid denials and ceasefire. \ue200cite\ue202turn14search14\ue202turn12search5\ue201\n- **Realist about leverage.** Acknowledging that Washington is the decisive actor is factual, not fatalistic. It avoids performative steps that won\u2019t move the needle on ground conditions. \ue200cite\ue202turn14search2\ue201\n- **Engagement, not isolation.** Maintaining ties preserves channels to press humanitarian access and restraint\u2014consistent with Singapore\u2019s practice in other crises. (Also note: while Singapore sanctioned Russia in 2022, it did not sever diplomatic relations.) \ue200cite\ue202turn11search0\ue201\n- **Domestic risk management.** Clear condemnation of terrorism + strong criticism of excessive force aims to reduce polarisation at home while upholding principled lines abroad. \ue200cite\ue202turn15search0\ue202turn14search7\ue201\n\n## Real tensions and weak points\n- **Recognition pre-conditions risk circularity.** Demanding a viable government and territorial control *before* recognition risks granting the occupier a veto: if Israeli policy is (as he says) to block Palestinian statehood, waiting for \u201cviability\u201d may mean waiting indefinitely. A counter-view is that coordinated recognition could *help* consolidate Palestinian governance and legal personality, as several Western capitals now argue. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search5\ue202turn13search24\ue201\n- **Uneven coercive toolkit.** Singapore imposed autonomous financial/export sanctions on Russia for Ukraine\u2014an exceptional step framed as defence of sovereignty and the UN Charter. If IHL violations in Gaza are acknowledged, the choice not to adopt even narrowly-tailored measures (e.g., settlement-goods restrictions or visa bans on extremist actors) opens Singapore to charges of inconsistency, even if circumstances differ. \ue200cite\ue202turn11search0\ue201\n- **Betting on US movement.** If Washington\u2019s stance remains largely static, Singapore\u2019s \u201cwait for viability\u201d position could become isolated as more allies recognise Palestine, eroding normative credibility with domestic and regional audiences that expect stronger action. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search5\ue202turn13search24\ue202turn13search8\ue201\n- **Channel vs. influence.** Keeping ties so \u201cthey listen\u201d is useful, but the government should be candid about what specific asks have been made and with what effect\u2014especially on humanitarian access, which MFA now explicitly says Israel must restore. Otherwise, \u201cengagement\u201d risks looking symbolic. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn12search5\ue201\n\n## What would change Singapore\u2019s calculus?\n- **A credible Palestinian technocratic unity arrangement** (e.g., PA reforms with security guarantees and a transition plan for Gaza) \u2192 makes \u201cviability\u201d less hypothetical and recognition more defensible. \ue200cite\ue202turn14search2\ue201\n- **A durable ceasefire + humanitarian access regime** verified multilaterally \u2192 lowers the risk that recognition is purely symbolic and raises its utility in a political process. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search5\ue201\n- **Convergence among key partners** (UK/France/Canada follow-through at UNGA, plus movement by Japan or South Korea) \u2192 reduces diplomatic cost for Singapore to move in tandem. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search24\ue202turn13search5\ue202turn13search8\ue201\n- **Escalating abuses documented by credible bodies** with no remedial action \u2192 pressure to align tools (e.g., targeted measures) with stated principles grows. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search3\ue201\n\n## Bottom line\nShanmugam\u2019s line is a classic Singapore blend of **legal principle + strategic caution**: condemn Hamas\u2019 terror and Israel\u2019s excesses, push two-state orthodoxy, keep humanitarian aid flowing (Singapore has sent multiple tranches), maintain channels, and delay recognition until governance and territory are more concrete. That is coherent and domestically stabilising\u2014but it carries **reputational risk** if recognition by close partners proceeds and \u201cwaiting for viability\u201d becomes an indefinite holding pattern effectively conditioned on Israeli consent. If Singapore wants to keep its moral authority *and* its room to manoeuvre, it should define **clear, public triggers** for when \u201cprepared in principle\u201d becomes \u201cnow,\u201d and consider **narrow, principled measures** aligned with its Russia precedent should IHL violations persist. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search10\ue201\n\n**Sources:** CNA coverage of his remarks and MFA/PM statements;

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that this move aligns with international momentum advocating for a two-state solution, a ceasefire in Gaza, and the release of hostages, especially following similar recognitions by France, Britain, and Canada. Australia's recognition comes with assurances from the Palestinian Authority that Hamas will not be involved in a future Palestinian state. The decision follows criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration, particularly regarding plans for military control of Gaza and expanding settlements. Foreign Minister Penny Wong notified U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, although the U.S. and Israel have criticized the decision. Albanese emphasized that political solutions, not military ones, are essential to ending violence in the region. The recognition also allows Australia to independently aid reconstruction efforts in Gaza and engage in bilateral treaties. The move has been positively received by Palestinian representatives and former Australian officials, while prompting New Zealand to reexamine its stance. The ongoing conflict has resulted in significant casualties and humanitarian crises in Gaza.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn14search14\ue202turn12search5\ue201","start_idx":2980,"end_idx":3015,"safe_urls":["https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-israel-gaza-conflict-violation-international-humanitarian-law-5256406?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/05/Spokespersons-comments-gaza-20-may-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Home](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/05/Spokespersons-comments-gaza-20-may-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-israel-gaza-conflict-violation-international-humanitarian-law-5256406?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"MFA Spokesperson's Comments on Gaza, 20 May 2025","url":"https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/05/Spokespersons-comments-gaza-20-may-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"May 20, 2025 \u2014 Singapore calls for the immediate full resumption of humanitarian aid for the Palestinian civilians in Gaza and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Home"},{"title":"Singapore says denial of aid in Gaza violates international ...","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-israel-gaza-conflict-violation-international-humanitarian-law-5256406?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jul 24, 2025 \u2014 \"The denial of humanitarian aid has caused mass starvation and a dire lack of essential medical services.

Ground and air strikes have targeted the Zeitoun and Shijaiyah neighborhoods, transforming once-populated areas into devastated combat zones. Israeli forces emphasize Gaza City as a Hamas stronghold, hosting both leadership and tunnel networks, while hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped, facing both conflict and famine.\n\nThe offensive sparked domestic protests, particularly in Tel Aviv, where reservists question the political motives behind the operation. At least 47 people were killed across Gaza on Tuesday alone, including airstrike victims in Tel al-Hawa. Strikes also claimed lives near humanitarian aid sites, with aid seekers frequently caught in deadly incidents. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry reports over 63,000 Palestinian deaths and rising malnutrition-related fatalities due to famine conditions.\n\nOn the Israeli side, the conflict began with a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and resulted in 251 hostages, about 48 of whom remain in Gaza.

Despite international condemnation and opposition from Israeli military chief Eyal Zamir, Netanyahu is moving forward with what critics say is a potentially devastating and futile campaign. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have escalated airstrikes and positioned troops on the city's outskirts, instructing civilians to evacuate, although many face dire conditions and limited space in southern Gaza.\n\nUp to 60,000 reservists are being mobilized, potentially rising to 120,000. Analysts anticipate urban warfare fraught with Hamas resistance across rooftops, alleys, and tunnels, despite claims that most of the group\u2019s forces are broken. Critics warn of a humanitarian crisis, as over 80% of Gaza City's homes are already damaged, and the UN has declared famine conditions. Church leaders and humanitarian groups warn that forced evacuations could amount to ethnic cleansing.\n\nNetanyahu is demanding Hamas\u2019s full surrender, but experts doubt military success will end the conflict.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing to accelerate the campaign, which was approved by the security cabinet weeks earlier, even as military chief Eyal Zamir warns against the move. Zamir has expressed concern that a full assault on Gaza City could further jeopardize hostages and strain military resources already stretched thin. Some reservists have also criticized the operation\u2019s lack of clear objectives and strategy.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli airstrikes have intensified, killing at least 86 people in the past 24 hours, including several children. Civilian casualties and starvation-related deaths in Gaza continue to mount, with the Gaza health ministry reporting at least 361 starvation deaths, including 130 children. Israel disputes these figures, citing other medical causes. The conflict, which began on October 7, 2023, following a deadly Hamas attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and resulted in 251 hostages, has now reportedly resulted in over 62,000 Palestinian deaths.

However, it does not affect those with existing visas or Palestinians applying with other national passports. This move follows a broader pattern of restrictions amid the ongoing Gaza conflict, including the suspension of all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza and the revocation of visas for dozens of Palestinian officials, such as President Mahmoud Abbas. The administration has faced criticism from humanitarian groups and international backlash, while countries like France, Canada, and the UK are considering recognizing Palestinian statehood.

Foreign Minister Maxime Pr\u00e9vot stated that the official announcement would occur at the UN General Assembly on September 9. However, Belgium's recognition is conditional on the release of all Israeli hostages held in Gaza and the removal of Hamas from power, making immediate recognition unlikely. In addition, Belgium plans to ban imports from Israeli settlements and designate Hamas leaders, violent settlers, and two far-right Israeli ministers persona non grata. Pr\u00e9vot emphasized that these measures target Israeli policies, not its people, and urged the EU to suspend the Association Agreement with Israel to increase pressure.\n\nThe move has been met with sharp criticism from Israel, especially from far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. Belgium joins several European countries, such as France and the UK, in signaling support for Palestinian statehood, though many await reforms from the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians aim to establish a state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza\u2014territories occupied by Israel since 1967.

The court clarified that imposing tariffs isn\u2019t among the powers IEEPA grants the president. The ruling could affect Trump\u2019s trade deals and the billions in collected tariffs.\n\nIn other news, the U.S. denied visas to senior Palestinian officials, including Palestinian Authority leader Mahmud Abbas, ahead of the UN General Assembly, escalating tensions and aligning further with Israel. This move comes amid continued conflict in Gaza, with the Israeli military declaring Gaza City a \u201cdangerous combat zone\u201d and recovering the remains of two hostages.

That\u2019s the tightrope Shanmugam was sketching: signal clear limits on conduct, keep channels open, and avoid symbolic moves that don\u2019t improve the situation on the ground. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news47\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\nHere\u2019s a hard-nosed read of that approach\u2014strengths, frictions, and what a defensible \u201cpolicy we can live with\u201d actually looks like.\n\n# Why this calibration is defensible\n- **Security first, at home.** ISD\u2019s recent cases (including youth) and the 2025 threat assessment underline real spillover risks from Gaza into online radicalisation here. A cautious posture plus visible humanitarian action is aimed at lowering domestic temperature while upholding norms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- **Maintain leverage by staying engaged.** Singapore has condemned excesses and pressed IHL compliance, but it also keeps ties and channels\u2014backed by practical aid and a Ramallah office\u2014to do useful things (training PA officials; getting aid in). That\u2019s not hand-wringing; it\u2019s the small-state playbook. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn2search14\ue201\n- **Consistency with past principles.** The government\u2019s line matches its legalist instincts (UN, IHL) and the \u201cprepared in-principle\u201d recognition stance\u2014recognise when it helps a real pathway, not when it\u2019s performative. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search8\ue202turn2search2\ue201\n\n# Where the tightrope frays\n- **Recognition \u201cviability\u201d risks circularity.** If viability requires governance and territorial control *first*, an occupying power effectively wields a veto. As close partners (UK, France, Canada) shift toward recognition at UNGA in September, Singapore\u2019s hedge could start to look like indefinite deferral. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search15\ue201\n- **Tools vs. principles.** Singapore applied autonomous sanctions on Russia in 2022 to defend the UN Charter. If it now accepts \u201clikely IHL breaches\u201d in Gaza but refuses even narrowly-tailored measures (e.g., settlement-linked restrictions or visa bans on extremist actors), critics will allege double standards\u2014even if contexts differ. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n- **\u201cEngagement\u201d needs outcomes.** Without demonstrable wins (e.g., more aid access, hostages, de-escalation commitments), keeping ties risks looking symbolic rather than instrumental. (To be fair, Singapore has delivered repeated aid tranches, including airdrops.) \ue200cite\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn2search14\ue201\n\n# A pragmatic policy Singapore can live with (now), with clear \u201cnext steps\u201d\n**No-regrets actions (immediately):**\n- **Concrete humanitarian delivery + transparency:** Keep the airdrops/air-bridge through Jordan and publish monthly metrics (tons delivered, corridors opened). This shows engagement has *operational* payoffs, not just rhetoric. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn2search14\ue201  \n- **Domestic risk management:** Scale up targeted counter-radicalisation comms and community outreach tied to the **2025 Threat Assessment**, with regular public updates on ISD trends (age profiles, vectors) to inoculate communities against online recruitment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n- **Multilateral legal signalling:** Keep voting and speaking on IHL obligations (aid access, hostages, proportionality, settlement expansion), including explicit references to hostage-release imperatives while ceasefire talks stall. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search8\ue202turn0news47\ue201\n\n**A \u201cconditionality ladder\u201d short of immediate recognition:**\n1) **Upgrade political recognition without full state recognition:** Elevate Ramallah representation (staffing/budget), expand PA capacity-building on public finance/policing, and set public milestones the PA must meet (anti-corruption, unified security chain-of-command). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search6\ue201  \n2) **Targeted, principle-based measures:** Consider narrowly-scoped restrictions aligned with international law (e.g., treatment of settlement-linked entities) that don\u2019t sever ties but make clear Singapore\u2019s IHL red lines\u2014mirroring the proportional toolset used in 2022 without copying it wholesale. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n3) **Hostage-centric diplomacy:** Publicly weight Singapore\u2019s next diplomatic steps to measurable hostage progress (ICRC access, proof-of-life cadence, exchanges), acknowledging the enduring moral and operational constraint that hostages impose. Current estimates put **~48\u201350** still in captivity; build your policy clock around that reality. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news47\ue202turn0news45\ue201\n\n**Clear triggers for *when* \u201cprepared in-principle\u201d becomes \u201cnow\u201d:**\n- **Governance:** A credible PA-led (or technocratic) unity framework for Gaza/West Bank with defined security arrangements and third-party monitoring.  \n- **Security/Humanitarian:** A durable ceasefire + verified aid access regime (including UNRWA resumption) sustained for a set period.  \n- **International alignment:** If core partners actually execute recognition at UNGA (not just signal), Singapore moves in calibrated tandem (e.g., recognition with an implementation roadmap and explicit expectations on non-violence and mutual recognition). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search18\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search15\ue201\n\n# Bottom line\nYour framing is the right one: **choose a stance Singapore can live with**\u2014one that dampens domestic risk, preserves strategic latitude, and still advances norms. The government\u2019s current posture is coherent on those terms. The **risk** is drifting into **permanent postponement** as partners move ahead. The mitigation is to publish **explicit, measurable triggers** (hostages, governance, humanitarian access) and to align **narrow, lawful tools** with stated principles.

Israeli forces emphasize Gaza City as a Hamas stronghold, hosting both leadership and tunnel networks, while hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped, facing both conflict and famine.\n\nThe offensive sparked domestic protests, particularly in Tel Aviv, where reservists question the political motives behind the operation. At least 47 people were killed across Gaza on Tuesday alone, including airstrike victims in Tel al-Hawa. Strikes also claimed lives near humanitarian aid sites, with aid seekers frequently caught in deadly incidents. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry reports over 63,000 Palestinian deaths and rising malnutrition-related fatalities due to famine conditions.\n\nOn the Israeli side, the conflict began with a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and resulted in 251 hostages, about 48 of whom remain in Gaza.

Your framing\u2014condemn terrorism and hostage-taking; insist on international humanitarian law; uphold a two-state end-state; and maintain channels rather than take performative steps\u2014reflects the core instincts of Singapore\u2019s foreign policy: a small-state realism anchored in law, consistency, and domestic cohesion.\n\n### Why the stance is deserving of merit\n\n1) **Principled consistency.** Singapore\u2019s emphasis on international humanitarian law (IHL), proportionality, and a negotiated two-state solution matches our longstanding, law-first posture. It rejects both impunity and nihilism.\n\n2) **Security-minded prudence.** By avoiding dramatic symbolism that does not alter facts on the ground, the Government protects internal cohesion at a time of heightened emotions and real risks of online radicalisation. This is fully aligned with our whole-of-society security paradigm.\n\n3) **Preserving channels in service of outcomes.** Maintaining ties\u2014even amidst censure\u2014offers avenues to press for humanitarian access, restraint, and eventual political movement. For a small state, practical access often matters more than maximalist signalling.\n\n4) **Recognition as an instrument, not an end.** \u201cPrepared in-principle, at an appropriate time\u201d is a defensible hedge: recognition should help build a viable Palestinian polity and a credible process, not become a consolation prize that entrenches stalemate.\n\nThese are sound pillars. That said, the same caution can\u2014if left unsharpened\u2014create vulnerabilities. I offer the following in a constructive spirit.\n\n---\n\n## Potential weaknesses\u2014and how to remedy them\n\n### 1) A **viability pre-condition** that can become circular  \n**Risk:** Requiring functioning governance and secure territory *before* recognition can, in practice, hand a veto to the occupying power. As more partners contemplate recognition, Singapore could look perpetually \u201calmost ready,\u201d eroding normative credibility with key regional audiences.\n\n**Remedy:** Publish a **Recognition Readiness Framework** with objective triggers and a review cadence (e.g., quarterly):\n- **Governance:** a PA-led or technocratic unity arrangement with a defined security chain-of-command, audited public-finance controls, and an agreed transition plan for Gaza.  \n- **Security/Humanitarian:** a durable ceasefire; verified aid access and deconfliction; ICRC access/proof-of-life cadence for hostages.  \n- **Diplomatic alignment:** meaningful convergence among core partners (e.g., a small coalition moving in tandem).  \nState up-front that *partial* progress on two of three tracks could justify **graduated political recognition** (e.g., mission upgrade, treaty-level cooperation) short of full de jure recognition\u2014so momentum is encouraged rather than punished.\n\n### 2) **Consistency gap** in tools vs principles  \n**Risk:** Having labelled conduct in Gaza as having likely breached IHL, yet taking no targeted measures at all (even where they are narrow and lawful), invites allegations of double standards when compared with past sanctions episodes.\n\n**Remedy:** Adopt **narrow, principle-based measures** that stop well short of severing ties but align tools with law:\n- An **enhanced due-diligence advisory** for Singapore companies on activities linked to settlement expansion or clear IHL risk zones.  \n- **Public-procurement exclusions** for entities credibly tied to serious IHL breaches.  \n- **Targeted visa restrictions** for individuals credibly implicated in extremist violence or incitement, applied consistently across conflicts.  \nEach step should be procedurally tight, evidence-based, and explicitly reversible\u2014underscoring that the goal is conduct change, not punishment for its own sake.\n\n### 3) Over-reliance on **U.S. leverage**  \n**Risk:** Realistically acknowledging Washington\u2019s decisive influence is sound; *appearing* to wait upon it can reduce Singapore\u2019s agency and compress our policy space if U.S. politics stall.\n\n**Remedy:** Build a **minilateral lane** with like-minded middle powers (e.g., Japan, ROK, Australia, Canada, select EU/Nordics) to:  \n- Coordinate humanitarian access demands and deconfliction expectations;  \n- Back a **security-guarantees working group** for a future PA-led force in Gaza;  \n- Sequence a **recognition-with-roadmap** option if the UN track moves and U.S. policy lags.  \nThis complements, rather than confronts, U.S. centrality\u2014and preserves our flexibility.\n\n### 4) \u201cEngagement\u201d without **demonstrable outcomes**  \n**Risk:** Keeping channels is only persuasive if it yields tangible effects; otherwise it can look like symbolism.\n\n**Remedy:** Move to **metrics-based transparency**:\n- Publish monthly figures on humanitarian contributions (tonnage, corridors opened, convoy/air-bridge throughput) and specific diplomatic asks tabled through our channels.  \n- Tie any future upgrades in bilateral engagement to concrete improvements (aid access, reductions in civilian harm, hostage milestones).\n\n### 5) Domestic cohesion under **sustained psychological stress**  \n**Risk:** Prolonged war coverage, graphic content, and grievance narratives can steadily increase polarisation, especially among youth.\n\n**Remedy:**  \n- Expand **IRCC-style** community dialogues focused on media literacy and non-violence norms; co-design modules with youth leaders rather than speak *at* them.  \n- Strengthen **online early-warning** partnerships with platforms and civic groups to flag escalating rhetoric and redirect to credible counselling and discourse spaces.  \n- Sponsor **interfaith humanitarian initiatives** (e.g., joint fundraising/medical missions), turning empathy into constructive action.\n\n---\n\n## A forward-looking, Singapore-style roadmap\n\n1) **Define the \u201cconditionality ladder.\u201d** Publicly set the sequence: (i) governance and humanitarian triggers; (ii) political upgrade; (iii) time-bound review; (iv) possible recognition with a compliance annex (non-violence, mutual recognition, security cooperation). This clarifies that \u201cprepared in-principle\u201d is real, not rhetorical.\n\n2) **Operationalise humanitarian diplomacy.** Commit to a transparent, steady humanitarian pipeline and deconfliction advocacy, with regular reporting. Pair this with technical assistance to the PA on public finance, policing standards, and border management\u2014areas where Singapore has comparative advantage.\n\n3) **Hostage-centred signalling.** Make the release and welfare of hostages a visible lodestar in our public diplomacy and in how we time escalations or relaxations of measures. This aligns moral clarity with practical sequencing.\n\n4) **Minilateral ballast.** Convene or join a discreet Track-1.5 process in Singapore\u2014Israeli, Palestinian, U.S., Arab, and Asian middle-power experts\u2014to maintain dialogue on a realistic end-state (security guarantees, reconstruction finance, borders, and Jerusalem arrangements). Quiet convening is a niche Singapore can credibly own.\n\n5) **Communicate the why.** Explicitly link every external step to **domestic security and social harmony**: that our choices are designed to reduce civilian harm *and* keep Singaporeans safe and united\u2014because for a small, open, multiracial society, foreign policy begins at home.\n\n---\n\nMinister, Singapore\u2019s approach has been coherent: legalist, security-first, engagement-oriented. The risks arise not from its principles but from **drift**\u2014where caution becomes an open-ended holding pattern as others move. The remedies above keep the centre of gravity the same while adding clarity, conditionality, and credible levers. They preserve our relationships, protect our internal cohesion, and keep faith with the rules-based order that small states ultimately rely on.\n\nThank you for your leadership and for speaking with candour about both limits and responsibilities. I hope these suggestions are useful as the Government continues to calibrate a policy Singapore can live with\u2014one that is principled, pragmatic, and forward-leaning.\n\nYours sincerely,  \nE-Jay"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":8168,"end_idx":8168,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"channelnewsasia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/palestine-state-israel-gaza-conflict-shanmugam-middle-east-institute-5328156?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Immediate recognition of a Palestinian state may not help the Palestinian cause: Shanmugam","snippet":"9 hours ago \u2014 SINGAPORE: The immediate recognition of a Palestinian state would not change \u201cthe facts on the ground\u201d in favour of the Palestinians, and could ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"channelnewsasia.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/history-harsh-judgment-israel-palestine-gaza-shanmugam-5328296?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Israel's actions in Gaza have gone too far and will probably be judged harshly by history: Shanmugam","snippet":"8 hours ago \u2014 Israel's actions in Gaza have gone too far and will probably be judged harshly by history: Shanmugam.
