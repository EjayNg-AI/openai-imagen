Just-in-Time Oral Defenses (\"Micro-Vivas\")**\n**Method:** After each written assignment or project (especially those where AI tools are permitted), randomly select students for brief (5\u201310 minute) oral defenses. They must explain their work, justify choices, and respond to follow-up questions that probe conceptual understanding and real-time reasoning.\n\n**Purpose:**  \n- Ensures students *internalize* the material rather than just prompt engineer.\n- Discourages over-reliance on generative tools.\n- Gives you real-time feedback on their depth of understanding.\n\n**What to look for:**  \n- Can they reason about why something works, or just describe what they did?\n- Can they generalize beyond the assignment context?\n- Are their explanations internally coherent and mathematically sound?\n\n---\n\n### **2. Tool-Aided, Open-Process Portfolios**\n**Method:** Require students to submit a **process portfolio** for each major assignment:\n- Initial plan\n- Prompt engineering attempts\n- Outputs from AI tools (with annotations)\n- Manual refinements\n- Final result\n- Reflective commentary: \u201cWhat did I learn from this process?\u201d, \u201cWhat do I still not understand?\u201d\n\n**Purpose:**  \n- Encourages metacognition and accountability.\n- Makes the *learning journey* visible.\n- Promotes *constructive* use of AI (as collaborator, not oracle).\n\n**Assessment focus:**  \n- Depth of reflection and iteration.\n- Understanding evidenced in revisions.\n- Originality and independent insight, even when tools are used.\n\n---\n\n### **3. In-Class Constructive Synthesis Tasks**\n**Method:** Periodically assign short, timed in-class exercises (no AI or internet access) that require *synthesizing*, *reapplying*, or *extending* ideas recently covered:\n- E.g. \"Build a simplified version of the model you used last week, but without these libraries.\"\n- Or: \u201cGiven this claim from ChatGPT, is it correct? Prove or refute it.\u201d\n\n**Purpose:**  \n- Directly tests *internalized* knowledge and skills.\n- Trains students to *critically engage* with AI outputs.\n- Gives a baseline to compare against tool-assisted work.\n\n**Good synthesis prompts:**  \n- Reverse engineering: \u201cHere's a code output. Reconstruct what the prompt/code likely was.\u201d\n- Error analysis: \u201cThis generative model's result contains flaws. Where? Why?\u201d\n- Explain it to a peer: \u201cWrite a short note to a classmate struggling with concept X.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Closing Notes\n\nThese assessments are designed to:\n- Reinforce human understanding over tool usage.\n- Train students to *think with* AI rather than defer to it.\n- Expose shallow comprehension masked by fluent output.\n\nLet me know your subject domain and student level, and I can tailor these approaches with concrete examples."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"960f0038eb94f936-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"447189b1-c708-4d66-9312-dba65724e653","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"447189b1-c708-4d66-9312-dba65724e653","children":[]}}}
