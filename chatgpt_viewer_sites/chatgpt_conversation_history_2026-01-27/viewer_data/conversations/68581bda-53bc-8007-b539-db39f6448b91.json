Give your analysis of this developing news - what it means for Iran, Israel, the US, and the global geopolitical landscape in the near to intermediate term.\n\n---\n\nDate: 22 June 2025\n\n\r\n\r\n### **Opening Remarks by Secretary Hegseth**\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** Thank you for joining us this morning. Last night, on President Trump's orders, U.S. Central Command conducted a precision strike in the middle of the night against three nuclear facilities in Iran: Fordow and Isfahan, in order to destroy or severely degrade Iran's nuclear program. And as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs will demonstrate, it was an incredible and overwhelming success.\r\n\r\nThe order we received from our commander-in-chief was focused, it was powerful, and it was clear. We devastated the Iranian nuclear program, but it's worth noting the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people. For the entirety of his time in office, President Trump has consistently stated for over 10 years that Iran must not get a nuclear weapon, full stop. Thanks to President Trump's bold and visionary leadership and his commitment to peace through strength, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated.\r\n\r\nMany presidents have dreamed of delivering the final blow to Iran's nuclear program, and none could. Until President Trump. The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world that American deterrence is back. When this President speaks, the world should listen, and the U.S. Military, we can back it up\u2014the most powerful military the world has ever known. No other country on planet Earth could have conducted the operation that the Chairman is going to outline this morning. Not even close.\r\n\r\nJust like Soleimani found out in the first term, Iran found out that when POTUS says 60 days, that he seeks peace and negotiation, he means 60 days of peace and negotiation. Otherwise, that nuclear program, that nuclear capability, will not exist. He meant it. This is not the previous administration. President Trump said, \"no nukes.\" He seeks peace, and Iran should take that path.\r\n\r\nHe sent out a Truth last night, saying this: \"Any retaliation by Iran against the United States of America will be met with force far greater than what was witnessed tonight.\" Signed, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Iran would be smart to heed those words. He said it before, and he means it.\r\n\r\nI want to give recognition to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Staff, General Erik Kurilla at CENTCOM, who did a phenomenal job, he and his staff. All of CENTCOM, policy, across the board. This was a joint effort and a cross-the-Pentagon effort. I want to recognize the pilots who flew those bombers, who flew those fighters, who flew those refuelers\u2014warriors. I want to recognize the sailors on those destroyers, in those subs, on those carriers\u2014warriors, all of them. I want to recognize our soldiers doing air defense, base defense, QRF\u2014warriors, all of them. Every American involved in this operation performed flawlessly.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to give recognition to our allies in Israel as well. This is a plan that took months and weeks of positioning and preparation so that we could be ready when the President of the United States called. It took a great deal of precision. It involved misdirection and the highest of operational security. Our B-2s went in and out of... excuse me, of these nuclear sites, in and out and back, without the world knowing at all. In that way, it was historic. A strike that included the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001 and the first operational employment of the MOP, a Massive Ordnance Penetrator.\r\n\r\nThe mission demonstrated to the world the level of joint and Allied integration that speaks to the strength of our alliance and our Joint Forces. As President Trump has stated, the United States does not seek war, but let me be clear: we will act swiftly and decisively when our people, our partners, or our interests are threatened. Iran should listen to the President of the United States and know that he means it, every word.\r\n\r\nI want to give congratulations to our commander-in-chief. It was an honor to watch him lead last night and throughout, and to our great American warriors on this successful operation. God bless our troops. God bless America. And we give glory to God for his providence and continue to ask for his protection.\r\n\r\nI turn it over now to the Chairman for specifics.\r\n\r\n### **Operational Briefing by General Caine**\r\n\r\n**General Caine:** Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thanks for recognizing all of our folks out there doing our nation's work, and, uh, nice to see everybody on this early Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nLast night, on the President's orders, U.S. Central Command, under the command of General Erik Kurilla, executed Operation Midnight Hammer, a deliberate and precise strike against three Iranian nuclear facilities. This was a complex and high-risk mission carried out with exceptional skill and discipline by our Joint Force. I want to thank every service member, planner, and operator that made this mission possible. Their actions reflect the highest standards of the United States armed forces.\r\n\r\nThis operation was designed to severely degrade Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure. It was planned and executed across multiple domains and theaters with coordination that reflects our ability to project power globally with speed and precision at the time and place of our nation's choosing. This was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the timing of this plan.\r\n\r\nI'll refer you to the graphic on the side as I walk you through some of the operational details. Friday into Saturday morning, a large B-2 strike package comprised of bombers launched from the continental United States. As part of the plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy, a deception effort known only to an extremely small number of planners and key leaders here in Washington and in Tampa. The main strike package, comprised of seven B-2 Spirit bombers, each with two crew members, proceeded quietly to the east with minimal communication throughout the 18-hour flight into the target area. The aircraft completed multiple in-flight refuelings.\r\n\r\nOnce over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly timed maneuver requiring exact synchronization across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace, all done with minimal communication. This type of integration is exactly what our Joint Force does better than anyone else in the world.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time last night, and just prior to the strike package entering Iran, a U.S. submarine in the Central Command area of responsibility launched more than two dozen Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure targets at Isfahan. As the Operation Midnight Hammer strike package entered Iranian airspace, the U.S. employed several deception tactics, including decoys, as the fourth and fifth-generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude and high speed, sweeping in front of the package for enemy fighters and surface-to-air missile threats. The strike package was supported by U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Transportation Command, U.S. Cyber Command, U.S. Space Command, U.S. Space Force, and U.S. European Command.\r\n\r\nAs the strike package approached Fordow and Natanz, the U.S. protection package employed high-speed suppression weapons to ensure safe passage of the strike package, with fighter assets employing preemptive suppressing fires against any potential Iranian surface-to-air threats. We are currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 6:40 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 2:10 a.m. Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped two GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow. As the President stated last night, the remaining bombers then hit their targets as well, with a total of fourteen MOPs dropped against two nuclear target areas. All three Iranian nuclear infrastructure targets were struck between 6:40 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, that's about 2:10 in the morning local time in Iran, with the Tomahawk missiles being the last to strike at Isfahan to ensure we retained the element of surprise throughout the operation.\r\n\r\nFollowing weapons release, the Midnight Hammer strike package exited Iranian airspace, and the package began its return home. We are unaware of any shots fired at the package on the way out. Their fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface-to-air missile systems did not see us. Throughout the mission, we retained the element of surprise.\r\n\r\nIn total, U.S. forces employed approximately 75 precision-guided weapons during this operation. This included, as the President stated last night, fourteen 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, marking the first-ever operational use of this weapon.\r\n\r\nI know that battle damage is of great interest. Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction. More than 125 U.S. aircraft participated in this mission, including B-2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth-generation fighters, dozens and dozens of air refueling tankers, a guided-missile submarine, and a full array of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as hundreds of maintenance and operational professionals. As the Secretary said, this was the largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history and the second-longest B-2 mission ever flown, exceeded only by those in the days following 9/11.\r\n\r\nWell prior to the strike, General Kurilla elevated force protection measures across the region, especially in Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf. Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly poor choice. We will defend ourselves. The safety of our service members and civilians remains our highest priority.\r\n\r\nThis mission demonstrates the unmatched reach, coordination, and capability of the United States military. In just a matter of weeks, this went from strategic planning to global execution. This operation underscores the unmatched capabilities and global reach of the United States military. As the President clearly said last night, no other military in the world could have done this.\r\n\r\nI join the President and the Secretary in being incredibly proud of the air crews, naval forces, cyber operators, planners, support teams, and commanders who made this mission possible. It is their skill, discipline, and teamwork that makes this operation possible. I am particularly proud of our discipline related to operational security, something that was of great concern to the President, the Secretary, General Kurilla, and me, and we will continue to focus on this.\r\n\r\nAs we stand here this morning, many assets are still airborne, and we have hundreds deployed. I ask that we keep our warfighters on their way home and our deployed service members in our thoughts. Our Joint Force remains ready to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests in the region. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n### **Question and Answer Session**\r\n\r\n**General Caine:** Uh, we will take a few questions. Phil.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** Yeah. Um, so is regime change off the table, Mr. Secretary? And to the Chairman, um, you know, you said the battle damage assessment is still ongoing, but do you believe that some nuclear capability in Iran remains?\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** This mission was not and has not been about regime change. The President authorized a precision operation to neutralize the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian nuclear program and the collective self-defense of our troops and our ally, Israel.\r\n\r\n**General Caine:** Uh, thanks for your question. I think BDA is still pending, and it would be way too early for me to comment on what may or may not still be there, but thanks for the question.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** Mr. Secretary, can you tell me, was there a particular moment when the President decided to pull the trigger on this operation? Where he said, \"now,\" rather than it being, you know, something in the holster?\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** I would just say, having the opportunity to witness his leadership, he was fully committed to the peace process. He wanted a negotiated outcome, gave Iran every single opportunity, and unfortunately was met by stonewalling, which is why he gave them plenty of time to continue to come to the table and give up enrichment, give up the nuclear program. But there was a\u2014I won't say the particular moment\u2014there was certainly a moment in time where he realized that a certain action had to be taken in order to minimize the threat to us and our troops.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** Yeah. General, you say that General Kurilla increased force protection in Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf. Were those areas given any advance warning the attacks were coming? And also, Mr. Secretary, when were Congressional leaders notified? How long before the attacks?\r\n\r\n**General Caine:** To your first question, you know, the risk has clearly been rising over the last few weeks in the region. Based on that, and not a particular awareness of this operation, we've made smart decisions to minimize the risk to U.S. forces in the region.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** So they were given no advance warning?\r\n\r\n**General Caine:** No, sir.\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** Congressional... um, they were notified after the planes were safely out. We complied with the notification requirements of the War Powers Act. They were notified immediately thereafter.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** Thank you, Secretary. Two questions. Do you believe you completely destroyed Iranian nuclear capabilities? And how about Iranian ballistic missiles? You're always saying that these are the biggest threats. And the second question is very important: what will be your next step if Iran or militias under Iranian influence in the region attack U.S. interests or allies in the region?\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** And you can chime in on this too, Mr. Chairman. The battle damage assessment is ongoing, but our initial assessment, as the Chairman said, is that all of our precision munitions struck where we wanted them to strike and had the desired effect. Which means, especially in Fordow, which was the primary target here, we believe we achieved destruction of capabilities there. Ultimately, wherever it may be, whether it's in Iraq or Syria or bases in the Gulf, as the Chairman said, it would be a very bad idea for Iran or its proxies to attempt to attack American forces.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** Iranian and North Korea are cooperating on nuclear and missile development. Do you think there is a possibility that Iran, North Korea, and other forces, such as China, will join forces to retaliate against the United States?\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** Well, unfortunately, because of the policies under the previous administration, we drove those countries together. And ultimately, that creates a challenging environment. For this particular operation, the focus is on Iran and Iranian nuclear capabilities. That's our focus here. It's not just to say that they can't have it, but President Trump has said for over 20 years, frankly, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And ultimately, he decided this is the moment, given their stonewalling, when direct military action had to be taken to prevent that from happening.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** Thank you very much. Uh, General Caine, I understand OPSEC, I respect OPSEC. Can you say at all what security procedures are being taken to protect U.S. troops in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East? And Secretary Hegseth, as a Global War on Terrorism veteran, what do you say to veterans who may be concerned the U.S. is getting into another open-ended war in the Middle East over weapons of mass destruction?\r\n\r\n**General Caine:** Uh, thanks, sir, for the question. I won't comment on what force protection measures are being taken in the region. What I will say is we're being proactive and not reactive, and being very thoughtful about ensuring that we do all that we can to protect our forces out there.\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** I would just say, as the President has directed and made clear, this is most certainly not open-ended. It doesn't mean it limits our ability to respond. We will respond if necessary. The most powerful military in the world is postured and prepared to defend our people. But what the President gave us, as I said, was a focused, powerful, and clear mission on the destruction of Iranian nuclear capabilities. Those were the targets. That's what was struck. That was overwhelming. That's what the Iranian regime needs to understand. As the President put out last night, he wants peace. There needs to be a negotiated settlement here. We ultimately demonstrated that Iran cannot have a nuclear capability. That is a very clear mission set on this operation.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** Secretary, a question for the Secretary and the Chairman. How was the strike coordinated with the Israelis on a strategic level, militarily? And on a tactical level, was there any direct Israeli military participation in this operation?\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** Well, I would say, certainly Israel had an incredible military success, especially at the beginning and ongoing, in degrading Iranian capabilities, in degrading Iranian launchers and missiles. It's been incredible to watch what our ally Israel has been able to do. And there certainly have been conversations. I mean, General Kurilla at CENTCOM has worked closely in the defense of Israel for many years, and part of this operation was the defense of Israel and the ongoing defense of Israel. But as it pertains to this strike, this was U.S.-operated and U.S.-led.\r\n\r\n**General Caine:** We took advantage of some of the preparatory work that's been done over the past week and a half in terms of access of approach. I won't get into the particulars, but as the Secretary said, it was a U.S. strike. We made sure we were not in the same piece of airspace and sky. Aside from that, that was the extent of it.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** Secretary, first, are you concerned whatsoever now about the reaction from U.S. allies, given the strike, particularly those in the Gulf? And to the Chairman, if I may, I understand you don't want to speak to specific assets or force protection measures, but do you anticipate at least having to bring in any further assets from other theaters to aid in force protection over the coming days?\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** We certainly understand the challenges of allies in the region, and we have been respectful and working in collaboration with them as it pertains to basing and sensitivities there. Ultimately, they've got a lot of assets and people in those locations also, where American troops are co-located. So that's a concern of ours. We've been in close consultation with them, and we appreciate the support that we have.\r\n\r\n**General Caine:** Thanks for the question on the global picture. And as you know, that's one of my jobs, is to look globally at the entire range of challenges. We are always carefully considering our force posture around the world and then offering options to the Secretary and to the President. I won't comment on any future things, but the American people should know that we carefully consider those moves around the world and try to modulate as needed our force structure in the region.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** What communications are being sent to the Iranians right now, and is there any possibility of diplomacy now or in the coming days?\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** I can only confirm that there are both public and private messages being directly delivered to the Iranians in multiple channels, giving them every opportunity to come to the table. They understand precisely what the American position is, precisely what steps they can take to allow for peace, and we hope they do so.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** The President may not want an open-ended conflict. The Iranians may disagree. Are you prepared for a protracted war?\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** Well, anything can happen in conflict, we acknowledge that, but the scope of this was intentionally limited. That's the message that we're sending. The capabilities of the American military are nearly unlimited, so Iran in that sense has a choice. But we've made it very clear to them: this is nuclear sites, this is nuclear capabilities. This is the line that the President set, and we set that back. Now is the time to come forward for peace.\r\n\r\nAnd I think one of the takeaways from this as well is the unprecedented level of ongoing cooperation. I can't speak highly enough of the Chairman and his staff and General Kurilla in CENTCOM. What they've done to look around the corner, to pre-position, to understand how an operation like this comes together... the scope and scale of what occurred last night would take the breath away of almost any American if you had an opportunity to watch it in real time. And I think Tehran is certainly calculating the reality that planes flew from the middle of America, in Missouri, overnight, completely undetected over three of their most highly sensitive sites, and we were able to destroy nuclear capabilities, and our boys in those bombers are on their way home right now. We believe that'll have a clear psychological impact on how they view the future. And we certainly hope they take the path of negotiated peace. But I could not be more proud of how this building operated, of the precision, the sensitivity, and the professionalism of the troops involved in this effort.\r\n\r\nI will take one more question. Yes, right there.\r\n\r\n**Reporter:** Thank you. Mr. Secretary, concerning the justification for these strikes, in March, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released their threat assessment, concluding, quote, \"Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear programs he suspended in 2003,\" unquote. So what new intelligence does the U.S. have since then that the Iranians have changed their position on nuclear weapons? And does this new intelligence come from U.S. sources and methods, or are we getting this information from other countries?\r\n\r\n**Secretary Hegseth:** Well, I would just simply say that the President's made it very clear. He's looked at all of this, all of the intelligence, all the information, and come to the conclusion that the Iranian nuclear program is a threat, and was willing to take this precision operation to neutralize that threat in order to advance American national interests and reduce the Iranian nuclear program, and obviously, collective self-defense of ourselves and our allies. So he looked at all of it, understood the nature of the threat, and took bold action. I think the American people would expect that in a commander-in-chief. That's all we got. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Mr. Chairman, thank you."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"953ca5b338cdeb9e-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e30d2ba3-d58b-48e5-baef-ce2452ffe074","children":["eb0a698e-d888-4f63-bde7-c66d3a9090ff"]},"eb0a698e-d888-4f63-bde7-c66d3a9090ff":{"id":"eb0a698e-d888-4f63-bde7-c66d3a9090ff","message":{"id":"eb0a698e-d888-4f63-bde7-c66d3a9090ff","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750604774.505816,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"8e2f9a9a-fc7b-4b4d-830f-6bf74f1d5f1d","request_id":"953ca5b338cdeb9e-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8e2f9a9a-fc7b-4b4d-830f-6bf74f1d5f1d","children":["44595315-c52f-4047-93f4-e1c2ca0e4435"]},"44595315-c52f-4047-93f4-e1c2ca0e4435":{"id":"44595315-c52f-4047-93f4-e1c2ca0e4435","message":{"id":"44595315-c52f-4047-93f4-e1c2ca0e4435","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750604774.506003,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for relevant information on Iran strike","content":"I need to gather up-to-date information on the specific event mentioned\u2014\"Operation Midnight Hammer\" and its implications, including reactions from international bodies and other countries.

Diplomatic talks, led by European nations in Geneva, sought peaceful resolution, but Iran demands Israel halt its strikes before negotiating. The UN condemned attacks on Iranian hospitals and warned of potential nuclear danger if facilities are hit. The conflict has sparked regional unrest, humanitarian crises in Gaza, and mass evacuations of foreign nationals from Iran and Israel. The U.S., UK, and European allies expressed concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and urged restraint and diplomacy. Russian and Chinese officials highlighted the threat to regional stability and their evacuation efforts. The UN and IAEA stress diplomatic solutions, and humanitarian organizations decry worsening conditions in Gaza.

Close U.S.\u2013Israeli air-defense and ISR integration will intensify.\n\n* **Washington reasserts deterrence, but at real cost.**  Operation *Midnight Hammer* shows the U.S. can mount an 18-hour global strike with minimal warning; that message resonates from Pyongyang to Beijing.  However, CENTCOM bases are now on hair-trigger alert, tankers are surging into the region, and Congress is already fighting over War Powers notification timing.  Should Iran retaliate asymmetrically, the Administration will face pressure either to *double down* (risking a regional war) or to seek a negotiated off-ramp that may look like the 2015 JCPOA in new clothes.\n\n* **Global markets have priced in a geopolitical risk premium.**  Brent briefly jumped ~4 % before settling near $77/bbl as traders judged flows through Hormuz remain open\u2014for now.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  A sustained Iranian naval campaign could push prices beyond $100, derail disinflation momentum, and force emergency SPR releases.  Gold and U.S. Treasuries rallied; Asian equities sold off.\n\n* **Diplomatic fallout is immediate and polarized.**  \n  * **UNSC emergency session** convenes today; Russia and China have signaled condemnation and will likely veto any U.S.-backed resolution limiting Iranian retaliation.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n  * Gulf monarchies are publicly muted but privately anxious; they fear becoming battlegrounds yet quietly welcome a setback to Iran\u2019s breakout potential.  \n  * Europe urges de-escalation; the E3 are drafting an \u201cenhanced verification\u201d proposal to salvage inspections while avoiding a regional conflagration.  \n  * Moscow and Beijing may accelerate arms-tech cooperation with Tehran, arguing the strike proves the need for \u201ccollective security\u201d outside U.S. influence.\n\n---\n\n### Near-Term (0-3 months) Outlook\n\n| Domain | Likely Developments | Probability |\n|--------|--------------------|-------------|\n| **Iranian retaliation via proxies** | Rocket/drone attacks on U.S. positions in Iraq/Syria; Houthi harassment of Red-Sea shipping; cyber-intrusions on Gulf critical infrastructure | **High** |\n| **Direct IRGC missile strike on U.S. bases** | Limited salvo to signal resolve without mass U.S. casualties | **Moderate** |\n| **Strait of Hormuz disruption (>1 Mb/d curtailed)** | Swarm boat / mine incidents; insurance rates spike | **Moderate** |\n| **Diplomatic channel opens (via Oman/Qatar)** | Back-channel talks for \u201cenrichment freeze vs. sanctions relief\u201d | **Moderate-Low** |\n| **Additional U.S./Israeli kinetic action** | Follow-on strikes if Iran restarts visible enrichment | **Low** (unless Iran retaliates directly) |\n\n---\n\n### Intermediate-Term (3\u201318 months) Scenarios\n\n1. **Managed De-Escalation (\u224840 %)** \u2013 Iran confines response to proxies; U.S. imposes fresh but limited sanctions; EU mediates a \u201ccap-and-monitor\u201d deal restoring IAEA access.  Energy markets stabilize; regional risk premium persists but contained.\n\n2. **Escalatory Spiral (\u224835 %)** \u2013 Proxy attacks kill U.S. personnel; Washington responds; tit-for-tat expands to the Gulf littoral.  Oil breaches $120; global recession risk rises; Russia and China exploit distraction to advance aims in Ukraine and the South China Sea.\n\n3. **Covert Nuclear Rebuild & Second Strike (\u224825 %)** \u2013 Iran exits NPT, shifts enrichment to hardened clandestine sites, aided by Russian/Chinese tech.  Within 12\u201318 months Israel or the U.S. faces a reprise operation, this time without element of surprise, with higher regional war risk.\n\n---\n\n### Strategic Implications\n\n* **Non-Proliferation Regime Erodes.**  States such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, South Korea and even Japan will rethink their latency posture\u2014concluding that *having* a bomb guarantees survival, while *seeking* one invites pre-emption.\n\n* **Great-Power Alignment Deepens.**  The strike accelerates the Moscow-Beijing-Tehran entente. Expect expanded joint naval drills, integrated air-defense tech transfers, and coordinated diplomatic fronts in the UN and BRICS+ forums.\n\n* **U.S. Indo-Pacific Posture Impact.**  Carrier strike groups and ISR assets redeployed to CENTCOM diminish deterrence bandwidth in the Western Pacific, offering China a window\u2014particularly around Taiwan\u2019s January 2026 elections.\n\n* **Global Economic Headwinds.**  Even absent a supply shock, elevated insurance and hedging costs raise delivered energy prices, complicating central-bank disinflation campaigns, and pressuring emerging-market debt sustainability.\n\n---\n\n### Watch-List Indicators\n\n| Indicator | Why It Matters |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| **IRGC or proxy causality claims** | Signals imminent retaliatory timeline |\n| **AIS blackout or Iranian naval dispersion** | Suggests preparatory moves to threaten shipping |\n| **IAEA access status & Iran\u2019s NPT rhetoric** | Early clue to Tehran\u2019s strategic choice: rebuild or negotiate |\n| **U.S. force-flow orders (e.g., Patriot batteries, carrier extensions)** | Gauge Washington\u2019s expectation of prolonged confrontation |\n| **OPEC+ emergency consultations** | Whether Gulf producers offset potential shortfalls |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n*Operation Midnight Hammer* buys the U.S. and Israel **time, not closure**.  Whether that time is used for a diplomatic off-ramp or devolves into a broader regional conflict hinges on Tehran\u2019s calculus and Washington\u2019s willingness to match force with flexible diplomacy.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment\u2014reportedly 400kg at 60% U-235\u2014as a \"clear and present danger,\" noting it is just steps away from weapons-grade enrichment (90%). While no evidence confirms Iran is building nuclear warheads, intelligence agrees the country is poised to do so if ordered. The recent attacks targeted key locations including Natanz, Khondab, and Kermanshah, killing high-level Iranian officials and damaging infrastructure. However, it remains unclear if Israel destroyed Iran\u2019s uranium stockpile or crippled its ability to rebuild. International reactions vary, with France and Germany cautiously supportive of Israeli actions, while Russia and China condemn them. Experts warn that instead of halting Iran\u2019s program, the strikes may provoke a resolute pursuit of nuclear weapons, similar to historical precedents. Analysts stress that preventing Iran from advancing its nuclear capabilities now hinges on both continued military disruption and diplomatic efforts, despite the suspension of scheduled US-Iran talks. The incident marks a potentially destabilizing moment with the risk of broader regional conflict looming.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750055520.0,"attribution":"www.news.com.au"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.aljazeera.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/21/israel-strikes-irans-isfahan-nuclear-site-buildings-on-fire-in-tel-aviv","title":"Israel strikes Iran's Isfahan nuclear site, buildings on fire in Tel Aviv","snippet":"\u201cA centrifuge manufacturing workshop has been hit in Esfahan, the third such facility that has been targeted in Israel's attacks on Iran's ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750542892.126607,"attribution":"www.aljazeera.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/22/us-bombs-irans-nuclear-sites-what-we-know-so-far","title":"US bombs Iran's nuclear sites: What we know so far - Al Jazeera","snippet":"Trump has warned of more attacks on Iran after bombing some of its key nuclear energy sites, including Fordow.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750600134.309046,"attribution":"www.aljazeera.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.twz.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.twz.com/news-features/top-iranian-scientists-killed-by-secret-weapon-report","title":"Top Iranian Nuclear Scientists Killed By Secret Israeli Weapon: Report","snippet":"Code-named Operation Narnia, Israeli operatives reportedly used a \u201csecret weapon\u201d to simultaneously kill nine of Iran's top nuclear scientists ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750456492.128809,"attribution":"www.twz.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.fdd.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/06/18/centrifuge-factory-and-police-headquarters-destroyed-in-ongoing-israeli-strikes-on-iran/","title":"Centrifuge Factory and Police Headquarters Destroyed in Ongoing ...","snippet":"Centrifuge Factory Destroyed: Israeli fighter jets struck a centrifuge production facility in Tehran on June 17-18 during ongoing strikes on ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.fdd.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassinations_of_Iranian_nuclear_scientists","title":"Assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists - Wikipedia","snippet":"Finally, Abbasi was killed on 13 June 2025 during Israeli strikes on the Iranian nuclear program.

Short answer  \n**Yes.** In the ten days **before** the U.S. Operation *Midnight Hammer*, Israel ran its own air-and-covert campaign that:\n\n1. **Blew up at least three centrifuge-manufacturing workshops** (Isfahan twice, plus a smaller line in Tehran), thereby hobbling Iran\u2019s ability to build new IR-6/IR-8 machines.\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202L8-L11\ue202turn4view0\ue202L5-L6\ue201  \n2. **Assassinated a slice of the program\u2019s human \u201cbrain-trust.\u201d**  Israeli media and Western defense reporters say a Mossad unit (\u201cOperation Narnia\u201d) killed 9-17 senior nuclear scientists\u2014names include former AEOI chief Fereydoon Abbasi and laser-enrichment specialist Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi.\ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202L8-L14\ue201  \n\n### How that fits with the U.S. strike\n\n| Phase | Israeli objectives (13\u201321 June) | U.S. objectives (night of 21/22 June) |\n|-------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Supply chain & expertise** | Destroy centrifuge *production* sites and irreplaceable specialists so Iran cannot quickly rebuild hardware. | **Not** targeted\u2014Washington assumed Israel had already degraded this tier. |\n| **Enrichment cascades** | Limited damage to Fordow/Natanz underground halls (too deeply buried for JDAMs). | Drop 14\u00d7 30-klb MOPs to crush active IR-6 / IR-8 cascades and contaminate shafts. |\n\n### Net effect\n\n* Iran\u2019s current **cascades are wrecked** (U.S. MOPs).  \n* Its **ability to mass-produce modern centrifuges is badly degraded** (Israeli strikes).  \n* The **knowledge base has suffered a one-off but serious blow**\u2014elite physicists take decades to replace.\n\nThat combination buys months, perhaps years, of delay\u2014but because some tooling, mid-level engineers, and overseas supply channels survive, Tehran still retains a rebuild path if it chooses to pour money underground or shop abroad for

The conflict began with Israel's launch of \"Operation Rising Lion\" on June 13, 2025, involving over 200 aircraft targeting key Iranian nuclear and military facilities, including Natanz, Tabriz, and Tehran. The strikes caused substantial damage and reportedly set back Iran's nuclear program by years. In retaliation, Iran has launched counterattacks, resulting in at least 224 confirmed Iranian deaths, with independent estimates surpassing 400. High-ranking Iranian officials, including IRGC Commander Hossein Salami and nuclear scientist Fereydoon Abbasi, were killed. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei condemned Israel and vowed revenge, while mass panic and evacuations have gripped Tehran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the pre-emptive strikes as a necessity to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The United States has reinforced Israel's air defense, citing Iran's regional threats. Meanwhile, international leaders from the UN, EU, Arab League, and countries like China and Turkey are urging diplomatic de-escalation to avoid a broader regional war, which has already rattled oil markets and spurred global concern.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750070964.0,"attribution":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.aljazeera.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/21/israel-strikes-irans-isfahan-nuclear-site-buildings-on-fire-in-tel-aviv","title":"Israel strikes Iran's Isfahan nuclear site, buildings on fire in Tel Aviv","snippet":"\u201cThe air force struck the central facility along with buildings used to produce centrifuges.

Historical rebuild rates** | After Natanz 2020 explosion Iran re-installed \u22482,000 IR-2Ms in **~9 months** despite sanctions. Rebuilding an *entire* deep site took **>18 months** (IAEA & ISIS reports, 2021-23). | historical open-source (ISIS reports, 2021-23) | Provides a real-world benchmark for **factory reconstruction + cascade installation**. |\n\n---\n\n## Resulting estimates (assuming maximum Iranian resolve)\n\n| Capability | Bottleneck after June 2025 strikes | Earliest realistic rebuild (best-case) | Most likely rebuild (base case) | Added delay vs. pre-strike |\n|------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **(i) Fissile-material\u2013grade nuclear bomb** | 1. Re-establish centrifuge workshop<br>2. Manufacture & install \u22483,000 IR-6s<br>3. Accumulate 25 kg HEU \u2265 90 % | **~9 months** (if hidden workshop already partly tooled, import help from DPRK/China, and covert site excavated in parallel) | **12-18 months** (new surface workshop in Isfahan hinterland, re-use Natanz South cavern, work double-shift) | **+10-16 months** (round to **~1 year** median) |\n| **(ii) Radiological \u201cdirty\u201d bomb** | Secure fresh high-activity isotopes (Co-60, Cs-137) or salvage 60 % UF\u2086 residues; improvise dispersal device | **~6 weeks** (assemble from medical/industrial sources that escaped bombing) | **2-4 months** (must reconsolidate teams, relocate labs, evade ISR) | **+2-3 months** |\n\n### Why the dirty-bomb delay is so short  \n* Only milligrams\u2013grams of isotope are needed; Iran\u2019s industrial radiography and medical sectors still exist.  \n* Device engineering is crude; key people killed were nuclear-weapon physicists, **not** radiological-safety staff.\n\n### Why the weapon-grade path is a full-year setback  \n* **Factory first, centrifuges second.**  Without working lathes, carbon-fiber winding rigs and balance testers, new IR-6 rotors cannot be produced.  Building and qualifying such tooling even with smuggled parts historically takes **6-9 months**.  \n* **Underground halls must be excavated or cleared.**  Fordow shafts are collapsed; Natanz Pilot hall is ruined.  Excavating a fresh 80-m\u2013deep chamber and installing cascade piping adds another **3-6 months** even with 24/7 crews.  \n* **Brain drain adds friction.**  Mid-level engineers can run legacy lines, but replicating advanced IR-8 cascade diagnostics without the assassinated experts is non-trivial.  \n\n---\n\n## Key uncertainties (\u00b1) that could shift the clock\n\n1. **Hidden stock of spare IR-6 rotor assemblies**\u2014if >1,500 survived, shave 3-4 months.  \n2. **Foreign technical help** (e.g., Pyongyang vacuum-pump sets) could shorten tooling phase by 1-2 months.  \n3. **Further Israeli/U.S. follow-on strikes** against rebuild efforts could add *indefinite* extra delay.  \n4. **Iran quits NPT and goes for plutonium route** via Arak heavy-water reactor (less likely but would add years).  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom-line numbers you asked for\n\n* **Nuclear bomb (90 % HEU device):**  \n  * **+ ~12 months** (range 9\u201318 months) before Iran can again reach a <1-month breakout clock.  \n\n* **Radiological dirty bomb:**  \n  * **+ ~3 months** (range 1.5\u20134 months) before Tehran could field a credible mass-casualty device.  \n\nBoth figures assume Iran accepts a high risk of further U.S./Israeli strikes while rebuilding and that it throws maximum resources at the task."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search11\ue201","start_idx":347,"end_idx":380,"safe_urls":["https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10284/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.timesofisrael.com/mossad-says-iran-15-days-from-bomb-us-agencies-still-say-up-to-a-year-report/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/mossad-says-iran-15-days-from-bomb-us-agencies-still-say-up-to-a-year-report/?utm_source=chatgpt.com),

The president emphasized that the U.S. seeks peace but would respond decisively to any Iranian retaliation. His remarks suggested a renewed alignment with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a justification of the strikes by referencing Iran's long-standing hostility toward the U.S. and past attacks by Iranian forces.

The Pentagon stated the attack dealt a significant blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear program, though Iran denied major damage and vowed retaliation. This operation marked the largest and second-longest B-2 mission in U.S. history. Despite heightened military secrecy, it was revealed that one of the B-2 pilots was a woman. No radioactive contamination was reported at the targeted sites. The mission followed a week of Israeli strikes aimed at crippling Iran\u2019s air defenses and military leadership.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750620259.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thesun.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/35515862/us-bombs-iran-fordow-israel/","title":"US obliterates Iran's nuclear bases with 12 30,000lb bunker busting bombs and 30 Tomahawk missiles in historic attack","snippet":"In a historic military escalation, the United States launched a major air and sea offensive against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, targeting the heavily fortified Fordow site with 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators dropped by B-2 bombers, and the Natanz and Isfahan facilities with 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles from naval submarines. President Trump declared a complete obliteration of the targets, aligning the U.S. directly with Israel's strategy to neutralize Iran's nuclear capabilities. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu praised Trump's decisive action, emphasizing the joint operation's significance.\n\nIran condemned the strike, vowing severe retaliation and highlighting risks of wider regional conflict. Experts warned of potential responses including proxy attacks and threats to oil shipping lanes, notably the Strait of Hormuz. The UN criticized the strikes as dangerously provocative, risking global instability.\n\nThe attack marked the first combat deployment of the GBU-57 bomb and effectively ended ongoing U.S.-Iran diplomatic efforts. The bombed sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan were key elements of Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment infrastructure.

Additional strikes utilized 30 Tomahawk missiles launched from submarines stationed 400 miles away to attack the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear complexes, both previously targeted by Israel. The Natanz complex, housing Iran's primary uranium enrichment operations, was also bombed by a B-2 carrying two bunker busters. These strikes were carried out in coordination with Israel and followed Trump's warning about taking decisive action. Iran claimed it had evacuated valuable assets prior to the attack, but Trump declared the operation a complete success, asserting that Iran's nuclear capabilities had been \"obliterated.\" The United States maintains strategic military presence in Bahrain, aiding operational capabilities in the region. Iran's nuclear infrastructure includes several sites such as Arak, Bushehr, Gachin, and Parchin, each playing a role in uranium enrichment and potential weapons development.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750566910.0,"attribution":"www.thesun.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.axios.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-7de04c88-dc06-4c1c-b8cd-4592d392f0b2","title":"\u2622\ufe0f Axios AM: Inside Midnight Hammer","snippet":"In a historic escalation, President Trump authorized U.S. military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, marking direct intervention in support of Israel\u2019s goals to dismantle Iran's nuclear program.

While the Biden administration insists the conflict is with Iran\u2019s nuclear program\u2014not Iran itself\u2014tensions have surged. Iran vowed retaliation, criticizing the U.S. for betraying diplomacy. Trump's previous backchannel efforts for negotiations failed, prompting the military action. Congress is divided over the constitutionality of the strikes, with some lawmakers demanding congressional authorization.

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the U.S. action, tying it to Israel's earlier offensives. The strikes have sparked international concern about potential nuclear contamination and the collapse of diplomatic efforts.

While decoy B-2 bombers were publicly reported flying toward Guam, the true strike force\u2014seven B-2 Spirit bombers supported by refueling and escort aircraft\u2014flew east from Missouri on an 18-hour mission targeting the Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow and Natanz.

The U.S. conducted a highly coordinated 25-minute airstrike on June 21, 2025, targeting three major Iranian nuclear sites\u2014Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. In total, 14 MOPs were delivered by seven B-2 bombers, which flew an 18-hour mission from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. The U.S. employed a range of diversionary tactics, decoys, and preemptive suppressive fire from F-22, F-35, and F-16 aircraft to avoid detection by Iran\u2019s defense systems. Additionally, a U.S. submarine launched over two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at infrastructure targets to further disable Iran\u2019s capabilities and maintain surprise. Despite the scale and intensity of the operation, Iran did not detect or engage the strike package. Defense officials highlighted the historical importance of this mission, emphasizing its strategic execution and technological milestones. The U.S. military remains on high alert for potential Iranian retaliation.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750631791.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":37}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"Initial battle damage assessments by the Pentagon describe **\u201cextremely severe damage and destruction\u201d** to all three sites\u2014including underground enrichment halls","start_idx":775,"end_idx":937,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Initial battle damage assessments by the Pentagon describe **\u201cextremely severe damage and destruction\u201d** to all three sites\u2014including underground enrichment halls","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"715-0","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":938,"end_idx":970,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Operation Midnight Hammer: How U.S. B-2 Bombers Struck Iran ...","url":"https://theaviationist.com/2025/06/22/operation-midnight-hammer/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750625202.857159,"snippet":"\u201cFinal battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage ...","attribution_segments":["715-0"],"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Operation Midnight Hammer Pentagon Press Conference Summary","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/1lhn944/operation_midnight_hammer_pentagon_press/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750596161.696439,"snippet":"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage ...","attribution":"reddit.com"},{"title":"United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750631791.0,"snippet":"On June 22, 2025,the United States Air Force and Navy attacked three nuclear facilities in Iran as part of the Iran-Israel war.
