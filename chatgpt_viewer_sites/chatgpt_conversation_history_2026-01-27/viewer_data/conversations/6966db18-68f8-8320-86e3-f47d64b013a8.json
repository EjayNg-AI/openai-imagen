Let $\\mathbb{Z}$ denote the set of all integers.\n\n\\begin{ax}[Well-Ordering Principle of the Natural Numbers] \\label{ax1}\nEvery non-empty set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ contains a least element; that is, there exists an element $a \\in S$ such that $a \\le s$ for every $s \\in S$. \\index{Well-Ordering Principle}\n\\end{ax}\n\n\\noindent\nTo state a useful extension of the above principle from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$, we first recall what it means for a non-empty set of real numbers to be bounded above or bounded below.\n\n\\begin{defn}\nLet $S$ be a non-empty set of real numbers. We say that $S$ is {\\bf bounded above} if there exists a real number $x$ such that $x \\ge s$ for all $s \\in S$. \\index{bounded!above} The number $x$ itself need not be a member of $S$. We call $x$ an {\\bf upper bound} of $S$. \\index{bound!upper} Upper bounds of sets of real numbers, if they exist, are never unique.\n\nSimilarly, we say that $S$ is {\\bf bounded below} if there exists a real number $x$ such that $x \\le s$ for all $s \\in S$. \\index{bounded!below} We call $x$ a {\\bf lower bound} of $S$. \\index{bound!lower} Lower bounds of sets of real numbers, if they exist, are also never unique.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\begin{rem}\nA non-empty set of real numbers can be bounded below and yet fail to have a least element. For example, the interval $(0,1)$ is bounded below (by $0$) but has no least element.\n\\end{rem}\n\n\\begin{cor} \\label{cor1.1.3}\nEvery non-empty set $S$ of integers that is bounded below contains a least element; that is, there exists an element $a \\in S$ such that $a \\le s$ for all $s \\in S$. Similarly, every non-empty set $T$ of integers that is bounded above contains a greatest element; that is, there exists an element $b \\in T$ such that $t \\le b$ for all $t \\in T$. \\index{Well-Ordering Principle!generalization to $\\mathbb{Z}$}\n\\end{cor}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $x$ be a lower bound of $S$. Choose an integer $m$ such that $m \\le x$ (for instance, one may take $m = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$). Then $m$ is also a lower bound of $S$, since $m \\le x \\le s$ for all $s \\in S$.\n\nDefine\n\\[\nJ=\\{\\, s-m+1 \\ : \\ s\\in S \\,\\}.\n\\]\nFor each $s\\in S$ we have $s-m \\ge 0$, hence $s-m+1 \\ge 1$, so $J \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$. The set $J$ is non-empty because $S$ is non-empty. By the Well-Ordering Principle (Axiom \\ref{ax1}), $J$ has a least element, say $c$.\n\nLet $a=c+m-1$. Then $a\\in S$ because $c\\in J$ means $c=s-m+1$ for some $s\\in S$, and then $a=s$. Moreover, for any $s\\in S$ we have $s-m+1 \\in J$, so by minimality of $c$,\n\\[\nc \\le s-m+1,\n\\]\nand therefore $a=c+m-1 \\le s$. Hence $a$ is the least element of $S$.\n\nIf $T$ is a non-empty set of integers that is bounded above, then\n\\[\nK=\\{\\, -t \\ : \\ t\\in T \\,\\}\n\\]\nis a non-empty set of integers that is bounded below. By the first part, $K$ has a least element, say $c$. Let $b=-c$. For any $t\\in T$, we have $-t\\in K$, hence $c \\le -t$, which implies $t \\le -c=b$. Thus $b$ is the greatest element of $T$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\noindent\nFor brevity, we shall use the term {\\bf Well-Ordering Principle} to refer either to Axiom \\ref{ax1} (for subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$) or to Corollary \\ref{cor1.1.3} (for subsets of $\\mathbb{Z}$); the intended meaning will be clear from context.\n\n\\begin{ax}[Least Upper Bound Property of the Real Numbers] \\label{axlub}\nEvery non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (also called the supremum).\n\\end{ax}\n\n\\begin{pro}[Archimedean Property of the Real Numbers] \\label{theorem1.1}\nIf $a$ and $b$ are real numbers with $a>0$, then there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $na>b$. \\index{Archimedean Property}\n\\end{pro}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nFix $a>0$. Consider the set\n\\[\nS=\\{\\, na \\ : \\ n\\in\\mathbb{N} \\,\\}.\n\\]\nThis set is non-empty (since $a\\in S$). We claim that $S$ is not bounded above.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that $S$ is bounded above. Then by the Least Upper Bound Property (Axiom \\ref{axlub}), $S$ has a least upper bound, say $L=\\sup S$. Since $a>0$, the number $L-a$ cannot be an upper bound of $S$ (otherwise $L-a$ would be a smaller upper bound than $L$). Hence there exists some $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that\n\\[\nma > L-a.\n\\]\nAdding $a$ to both sides gives\n\\[\n(m+1)a > L.\n\\]\nBut $(m+1)a\\in S$, contradicting the fact that $L$ is an upper bound of $S$. Therefore $S$ is not bounded above.\n\nSince $S$ is not bounded above, for any real number $b$ there exists $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $na>b$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{pro}[Principle of Finite Induction] \\label{theorem1.2}\nLet $S$ be a set of positive integers with the following properties: \\index{induction!finite}\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[FI1.] $1 \\in S$.\n\\item[FI2.] Whenever $k$ is an element of $S$, $k+1$ is also an element of $S$.\n\\end{description}\nThen $S$ is the set of all positive integers.\n\\end{pro}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nSuppose, on the contrary, that $S$ is not the set of all positive integers. Let $T=\\mathbb{N}\\setminus S$, that is, $T$ is the set of positive integers that are not members of $S$. By our assumption, $T$ is non-empty, so by the Well-Ordering Principle (Axiom \\ref{ax1}), $T$ has a least element, say $a$.\n\nSince $1\\in S$ by FI1, we have $a\\ne 1$, so $a\\ge 2$ and therefore $a-1$ is a positive integer. Because $a$ is the least element of $T$, no positive integer smaller than $a$ can lie in $T$, hence $a-1\\notin T$, which means $a-1\\in S$. By FI2 it follows that $a\\in S$, contradicting $a\\in T$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{rem}\nThe Principle of Finite Induction is also known as the {\\bf Principle of Mathematical Induction}. \\index{induction!mathematical}\nIf $P(n)$ is a mathematical statement depending on the positive integer $n$, then to prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n$ by induction, it is necessary and sufficient to verify conditions FI1 and FI2 of Proposition \\ref{theorem1.2}, where $S$ is the set of all positive integers $n$ for which the statement $P(n)$ is valid. The proof of FI1 is known as the {\\bf basis of the induction}, while the proof of FI2 is known as the {\\bf inductive step}. The assumption that $P(k)$ is true for some $k$ is known as the {\\bf inductive hypothesis}.\n\\end{rem}\n\n\\small\n\\begin{ex}\nProve that\n\\[\n\\sum_{r=1}^n r(r+1)=\\frac{1}{3}n(n+1)(n+2)\n\\]\nfor all positive integers $n$.\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\noindent\n{\\bf Answer.} Let $P(n)$ be the statement:\n\\[\n\\sum_{r=1}^n r(r+1)=\\frac{1}{3}n(n+1)(n+2).\n\\]\nConsider $n=1$. The left hand side of the equation is\n\\[\n\\sum_{r=1}^1 r(r+1)=1(2)=2,\n\\]\nwhile the right hand side of the equation is\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}(1)(1+1)(1+2)=\\frac{1}{3}(1)(2)(3)=2,\n\\]\nand so $P(1)$ is true. This is the basis of the induction.\n\nFor the inductive step, suppose that $P(k)$ is true for some positive integer $k$, that is,\n\\[\n\\sum_{r=1}^k r(r+1)=\\frac{1}{3}k(k+1)(k+2).\n\\]\nWe have to show that $P(k+1)$ is true. Since\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{r=1}^{k+1} r(r+1)\n&=\\left(\\sum_{r=1}^k r(r+1)\\right)+(k+1)(k+2) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}k(k+1)(k+2)+(k+1)(k+2) \\qquad \\text{(inductive hypothesis)} \\\\\n&=\\frac{k(k+1)(k+2)+3(k+1)(k+2)}{3} \\\\\n&=\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(k+3)}{3} \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}(k+1)\\bigl((k+1)+1\\bigr)\\bigl((k+1)+2\\bigr),\n\\end{align*}\nthe statement $P(k+1)$ is also true. This completes the inductive step, and hence $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$.\n\\end{ex}\n\\normalsize\n\n\\noindent\nThere is also a variant of the induction principle that is often less convenient or awkward to apply directly using Proposition \\ref{theorem1.2}.\n\n\\begin{pro}[Second Principle of Finite Induction]\nLet $S$ be a set of positive integers with the following properties: \\index{induction!second principle of}\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[SI1.] $1 \\in S$.\n\\item[SI2.] If $1,2,\\ldots,k$ are elements of $S$, then $k+1$ is also an element of $S$.\n\\end{description}\nThen $S$ is the set of all positive integers.\n\\end{pro}\n\n\\noindent\nThe Second Principle of Finite Induction is also known as the {\\bf Principle of Strong Induction}. \\index{induction!strong}\n\n\\small\n\\begin{ex}\nDefine a sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ of positive integers by setting $a_1=1$ and defining\n\\[\na_{n+1}=1+a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n\n\\]\nfor all $n\\ge 1$. Prove that $a_n=2^{n-1}$ for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\noindent\n{\\bf Answer.} Let $P(n)$ be the statement: $a_n=2^{n-1}$. Consider $n=1$. The left hand side is\n\\[\na_1=1\n\\]\n(which is given), while the right hand side is\n\\[\n2^{1-1}=2^0=1.\n\\]\nThus $P(1)$ is true. This is the basis of the induction.\n\nSuppose that for some positive integer $k$ we know that $P(1),P(2),\\ldots,P(k)$ are all true. That is, $a_i=2^{i-1}$ for $i=1,2,\\ldots,k$. Then\n\\begin{align*}\na_{k+1}\n&=1+a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_k \\\\\n&=1+2^0+2^1+\\cdots+2^{k-1} \\qquad \\text{(inductive hypothesis)} \\\\\n&=1+\\frac{2^k-1}{2-1} \\qquad \\text{(see Exercise \\ref{exer1.1} Q(\\ref{exer1.1.4}))} \\\\\n&=2^k \\\\\n&=2^{(k+1)-1}.\n\\end{align*}\nHence $P(k+1)$ is also true, and this completes the inductive step.\n\\end{ex}\n\\normalsize\n\n\\noindent\nHenceforth, we shall use the term ``induction'' to refer to either the Principle of Mathematical Induction or the Principle of Strong Induction.\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\noindent\nThus far, induction has been discussed as a method of proving that a set $S$ of positive integers satisfying FI1 and FI2 (or equivalently, SI1 and SI2) must be all of the positive integers, or more concretely, that a given statement $P(n)$ is true for all integers $n\\ge 1$.

The quantity $n!$, read $n$ {\\bf factorial}, is defined to be the product \\index{factorial}\n$$1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3  \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n.$$\nWe also define $0! = 1$.\n\n\\begin{defn}\nFor non-negative integers $n$ and $r$ with $n \\geq r$, define the {\\bf binomial coefficient} $\\operatorname{C}^n_r$, also denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, to be the quantity \\index{binomial!coefficient}\n$$\\frac{n!}{r! \\cdot (n-r)!}.$$\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\noindent\nSometimes, it is also convenient to express $\\operatorname{C}^n_r$ as\n$$\\frac{n \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot (n-2) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (n-r+1)}{r!}.$$\n\n\\noindent\nThe binomial coefficient $\\operatorname{C}^n_r$ is the number of ways of choosing $r$ objects from a collection $S_n$ of $n$ distinct objects without taking order into account -- the number of {\\bf $r$-selections of $S_n$}. To see why this is so, we first count the number of {\\bf $r$-permutations of $S_n$}, that is, the number of ways we can arrange $r$ objects from $S_n$ in a row. (In combinatorics, when we speak about arrangements or permutations, order is taken in account; but when we speak of selections or choices, order is irrelevant.)\n\n\\bigskip\n\\noindent\nPlace boxes labelled $1,2,...,r$ in a row, and fill them by putting one object from $S_n$ in each of them, starting from Box 1 on the left and moving to Box $r$ on the right.\n\n\\small\n\\begin{center}\n\\setlength{\\unitlength}{1mm}\n\\begin{picture}(115,30)(0,-10)\n\\multiput(0,0)(20,0){3}{\\line(1,0){15}\\line(0,1){15}}\n\\multiput(80,0)(20,0){2}{\\line(1,0){15}\\line(0,1){15}}\n\\multiput(0,0)(20,0){3}{\\line(0,1){15}}\n\\multiput(80,0)(20,0){2}{\\line(0,1){15}}\n\\multiput(0,15)(20,0){3}{\\line(1,0){15}}\n\\multiput(80,15)(20,0){2}{\\line(1,0){15}}\n\\put(4,-6){Box $1$}\n\\put(24,-6){Box $2$}\n\\put(44,-6){Box $3$}\n\\put(81,-6){Box $r-1$}\n\\put(104,-6){Box $r$}\n\\put(66,7){$\\cdots$}\n\\end{picture}\n\\end{center}\n\\normalsize\n\n\\noindent\nTo fill Box 1, there are $n$ choices of elements from $S_n$. For Box 2, there are now $n-1$ choices because we have used up one element for Box 1. Similarly, for Box 3, there are $n-2$ choices because we have used up two elements for Box 1 and 2. Continuing in this way, we observe that the number of ways we can fill the boxes is\n$$n \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot (n-2) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (n-r+1) = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}.$$\nThis quantity is commonly denoted as $\\operatorname{P}^n_r$, the letter P standing for ``permutation''. An important special case arises when $n=r$; in this case we are arranging all the $n$ objects of $S_n$ in a row, and the number of ways of so doing is\n$$n! = \\operatorname{P}^n_n = \\frac{n!}{(n-n)!}.$$\n\n\\noindent\nEvery $r$-selection of $S_n$ corresponds to exactly $r!$ different $r$-permutations of $S_n$, because there are $r!$ ways of arranging $r$ distinct objects in a row. Hence, if we are only interested in selecting $r$ objects from $S_n$ without arranging them in a row, then the number of ways we can do so is\n$$\\frac{\\operatorname{P}^n_r}{r!} = \\frac{n!}{r! \\cdot (n-r)!} = \\operatorname{C}^n_r.$$\n\n\\noindent\nThus, there are a total of $\\operatorname{C}^n_r$ different $r$-selections of $S_n$. \n\n\\bigskip\n\\noindent\nThe following binomial identities are straightforward to verify and are left to the reader to do so.\n\n\\begin{pro} \\label{pro1.2.2}\nLet $n,r$ be non-negative integers with $n \\geq r$.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $\\operatorname{C}^n_0 = \\operatorname{C}^n_n = 1$.\n\\item $\\operatorname{C}^n_r = \\operatorname{C}^n_{n-r}$.\n\\item If $n > r$, then $\\operatorname{C}^n_r + \\operatorname{C}^n_{r+1} = \\operatorname{C}^{n+1}_{r+1}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{pro}\n\n\\noindent\nWe now state and prove the main result of this section.\n\n\\begin{thm}[Binomial Theorem]\nLet $n$ be a positive integer.

Every term in the expansion is of the form $a^{n-r}b^r$, $0 \\leq r \\leq n$, because the power to which $a$ is raised and the power to which $b$ is raised adds up to $n$. Treating the $n$ brackets as distinct, the term $a^{n-r}b^r$ can be obtained by choosing the letter $b$ from $r$ brackets, and the letter $a$ from the remaining brackets -- the number of ways of so doing is $\\operatorname{C}^n_r$. Hence, the coefficient of $a^{n-r}b^r$ in the simplified expansion is $\\operatorname{C}^n_r$, and the result follows.\n\n\\bigskip\n\\noindent\n{\\bf Proof by induction:} The binomial theorem is clearly true for $n=1$, as\n$$(a+b)^1 = a+b = \\operatorname{C}^1_0 a + \\operatorname{C}^1_1 b.$$\nAssume the theorem to be true for $n=k$, that is, \n$$(a+b)^k = \\operatorname{C}^k_0 a^k + \\operatorname{C}^k_1 a^{k-1} b + \\operatorname{C}^k_2 a^{k-2} b^2 + \\ldots + \\operatorname{C}^k_k b^k = \\sum_{r=0}^k \\operatorname{C}^k_r a^{k-r}b^r.$$\nThen \n\\begin{align*}\n(a+b)^{k+1} &= (a+b)^k (a+b) \\\\ \n            &= \\left( \\sum_{r=0}^k \\operatorname{C}^k_r a^{k-r}b^r \\right) (a+b) \\\\\n            &= \\left( \\sum_{r=0}^k \\operatorname{C}^k_r a^{k-r+1}b^r \\right) + \\left( \\sum_{s=0}^k \\operatorname{C}^k_s a^{k-s}b^{s+1} \\right) \\\\\n&= a^{k+1}+\\left( \\sum_{r=1}^k \\operatorname{C}^k_r a^{k-r+1}b^r \\right)+b^{k+1}+\\left( \\sum_{s=0}^{k-1} \\operatorname{C}^k_s a^{k-s}b^{s+1} \\right) \\\\\n            &= a^{k+1} + \\left( \\sum_{r=1}^k (\\operatorname{C}^k_r + \\operatorname{C}^k_{r-1}) a^{k-r+1}b^r \\right) + b^{k+1} \\\\\n            &= a^{k+1} + \\left( \\sum_{r=1}^k \\operatorname{C}^{k+1}_r a^{k-r+1}b^r \\right) + b^{k+1} \\ \\ \\ \\text{by Proposition \\ref{pro1.2.2}(3)} \\\\\n            &= \\sum_{r=0}^{k+1} \\operatorname{C}^{k+1}_r a^{(k+1)-r}b^r,\n\\end{align*}\nand so the theorem is also true for $n=k+1$.

We say that {\\bf $b$ divides $a$}, \\index{divides an integer} or that {\\bf $a$ is a multiple of $b$}, \\index{multiple of an integer} written $b|a$, if $a$ leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by $b$; equivalently, $a = qb$ for some integer $q$.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\\noindent\nWe can also express the relation $b|a$ by saying that {\\bf $b$ is a divisor of $a$}, \\index{divisor!of an integer} or {\\bf $b$ is a factor of $a$}, \\index{factor of an integer} or {\\bf $a$ is divisible by $b$}. \\index{divisible by an integer} Sometimes when there is a need for emphasis, we may even say that {\\bf $b$ exactly divides $a$}, or {\\bf $a$ is exactly divisible by $b$}. All these various expressions are widely used, so the reader should be familiar with them.\n\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\noindent\nThe proof of the following Proposition is left as a straightforward exercise for the reader.\n\n\\begin{pro} \\label{pro1.4.2}\nLet $a,b,c,d$ be integers, where $a,b \\neq 0$ ($c,d$ are allowed to be 0).\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item It is always the case that $a|0$, $1|a$, and $a|a$. \n\\item $a|c$ if and only if $(-a)|c$, if and only if $a|(-c)$, if and only if $(-a)|(-c)$.\n\\item $a|1$ if and only if $a=1$ or $a=-1$.\n\\item $a|c$ if and only if $ab|cb$.\n\\item If $a|c$ and $b|d$, then $ab|cd$. In particular, because $1|d$, it follows that $a|c$ implies $a|cd$. Another corollary is that if $a|c$, then $a^n|c^n$ for all integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\\item If $a|b$ and $b|c$, then $a|c$. (Transitive property)\n\\item If $ab|c$, then $a|c$ and $b|c$. More generally, if $a_1,a_2,...,a_n \\neq 0$ and \n$$(a_1a_2 \\cdots a_n)|c,$$ \nthen $a_1|c$, $a_2|c$, ..., $a_n|c$.\n\\item $a|b$ and $b|a$ if and only if $a=\\pm b$, if and only if $|a|=|b|$. (Anti-symmetric property)\n\\item If $a|b$, then $|a| \\leq |b|$ (the condition $b \\neq 0$ is required).\n\\item If $a|c$ and $a|d$, then $a|(cx+dy)$ for any integers $x,y$ For generally, if $a|c_1$, $a|c_2$, ,..., $a|c_n$ for integers $c_1,c_2,...,c_n$, then $a|(c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + ... + c_nx_n)$ for any integers $x_1,x_2,...,x_n$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{pro}\n\n\\begin{rem}\nIf $a|(c+d)$, it need not be the case that $a|c$ or $a|d$. For example, $3|(2+4)$, but 3 neither divides 2 nor 4. Also, if $a|cd$, it similarly need not be the case that $a|c$ or $a|d$. For example, $12|(8 \\cdot 3)$, but 12 neither divides 8 nor 3.\n\\end{rem}\n\n\\small\n\\begin{ex} \\label{ex1.4.4}\nThe product of two consecutive integers is even. The product of 3 consecutive integers is divisible by 3. In general, the product of $n$ consecutive integers is divisible by $n$, for $n \\geq 1$.\n\\end{ex}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $S=\\{a,a+1,a+2,...,a+(n-1)\\}$ be a set of $n$ consecutive integers. Observe that no two integers in $S$ leave the same remainder when divided by $n$. Indeed, suppose that $a+i = q_1n + r$ and $a+j = q_2n + r$, where $0 \\leq i,j \\leq n-1$. Then $j-i = (q_2-q_1)n$. This means that $q_1=q_2$ and $i=j$, because $0 \\leq |j-i| < n$ whereas $(q_2-q_1)n$ is a multiple of $n$. \n\nThus, there is some $b \\in S$ for which $b$ is divisible by $n$. The product of all the integers in $S$ is therefore divisible by $n$.\n\\end{proof}\n\\normalsize\n\n\\small\n\\begin{ex}\nFor any integer $n$, one of the integers $n$, $n+2$, or $n+4$ is divisible by 3.\n\\end{ex}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nBy the Division Algorithm, $n=3k$, $3k+1$ or $3k+2$. If $n=3k$, then $n$ is divisible by 3. If $n=3k+1$, then $n+2 = 3k+3 = 3(k+1)$ is divisible by 3. If $n=3k+2$, then $n+4 = 3k+6 = 3(k+2)$ is divisible by 3.\n\\end{proof}\n\\normalsize\n\n\\small\n\\begin{ex}\nIf $n$ is an odd number, then $n^4 + 4n^2 + 11$ is divisible by 16.\n\\end{ex}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nBy Example \\ref{ex1.3.7}, $n^2 = 8k+1$ for some $k$. Thus, \n$$n^4 + 4n^2 + 11 = (8k+1)^2 + 4(8k+1) + 11 = 64k^2 + 48k + 16 = 16(4k^2 + 3k + 1)$$\nis divisible by 16.\n\\end{proof}\n\\normalsize\n\n\\small\n\\begin{ex}\nLet $k$ be an odd positive integer. Then for all integers $a,b$ with $a \\neq -b$, $a^{k} + b^{k}$ is divisible by $a + b$.\n\\end{ex}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nAppeal to the identity\n$$x^k + y^k = (x+y)(x^{k-1} - x^{k-2}y - \\ldots - xy^{k-2} + y^{k-1})$$\nfor odd positive integers $k \\geq 3$. For $k=1$, the result is true as it merely states that $a+b$ divides itself.\n\\end{proof}\n\\normalsize\n\n\\small\n\\begin{ex} \\label{ex1.4.8}\nLet $k$ be a positive integer. Then for all integers $a,b$ with $a \\neq b$, $a^{k} - b^{k}$ is divisible by $a - b$.\n\\end{ex}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nAppeal to the identity\n$$x^k - y^k = (x-y)(x^{k-1} + x^{k-2}y + \\ldots + xy^{k-2} + y^{k-1})$$\nfor positive integers $k \\geq 2$. For $k=1$, the result is true as it merely states that $a-b$ divides itself.\n\\end{proof}\n\\normalsize\n\n\\small\n\\begin{ex}\nLet $a,n,m$ be positive integers with $a \\geq 2$ and $m \\geq 3$. Then $a^m-1$ never divides $a^n+1$.\n\\end{ex}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nSuppose that $m > n$. Then \n$$a^m - a^n = a^n(a^{m-n} - 1) = a^n(a-1)(a^{m-n-1}+a^{m-n-2}+ \\ldots + 1) \\geq 4.$$\nHence, $a^m - 1 > a^n + 1$, and so $a^m-1$ cannot divide $a^n+1$.\n\nSuppose that $m \\leq n$. By the Division Algorithm, we can write \n$$n = qm + r,$$\nwhere $0 \\leq r < m$. Note that $q$ is positive because $n \\geq m \\geq 3$. Then we have\n$$a^n + 1 = a^{qm+r} + 1 = a^{qm}a^r + 1 = (a^{qm} - 1)a^r + (a^r + 1).$$\nSuppose that $a^m - 1$ divides $a^n+1$. By Example \\ref{ex1.4.8}, we also have $a^m - 1$ dividing $a^{qm} - 1$. Since $a^r + 1 = (a^n + 1) - (a^{qm}-1)a^r$, it now follows that $a^m - 1$ divides $a^r + 1$. But the case established previously asserts that $a^m - 1$ cannot divide $a^r + 1$ whenever $m > r$. This contradicts our assumption that $a^m - 1$ divides $a^n+1$, and so the result is proved.\n\\end{proof}\n\\normalsize\n\n\\small\n\\begin{ex}\nLet $n$ be a positive integer. Then $3^{2n} + 1$ is divisible by 2, but not by 4.\n\\end{ex}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWrite $3^{2n}$ as $9^n = (1+8)^n$. Using the Binomial theorem,\n$$1+(1+8)^n = 1 + \\binom{n}{0} + \\binom{n}{1} 8 + \\binom{n}{2} 8^2 + \\ldots + \\binom{n}{n} 8^n = 2 + 4 \\left[ \\binom{n}{1} 2 + \\binom{n}{2} 2(8) + \\ldots + \\binom{n}{n} 2(8^{n-1}) \\right].$$\nThus, $3^{2n} + 1 = (1+8)^n + 1$ leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, and so it cannot be divisible by 4. On the other hand, $3^{2n} + 1$ is even, so it is divisible by 2. Hence, it is divisible by 2 but not by 4.\n\\end{proof}\n\\normalsize\n\n\n\n\n\\small\n\\begin{exer} \\label{exer1.5.1}\n~\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Prove Proposition \\ref{pro1.4.2}.\n\\item Let $k \\geq 2$ be an even number.

That\u2019s fine in integers (integral domain), and you *did* assume \\(b\\neq 0\\).\n\nEverything else I checked that often hides mistakes appears solid:\n\n- **Division Algorithm proof**: the non-emptiness of \\(S=\\{a-xb\\ge0\\}\\), minimality argument, and uniqueness step are correct.\n- **Binomial theorem (both proofs)**: combinatorial counting and induction algebra/indexing are correct.\n- **Parity / squares mod \\(4,8,16\\)** examples: computations and case splits are correct.\n- **Example \\ref{ex1.4.4} (product of \\(n\\) consecutive integers divisible by \\(n\\))**: the \u201cdistinct remainders\u201d argument is correct and uses the key fact \u201conly multiple of \\(n\\) with \\(|\\cdot|<n\\) is \\(0\\)\u201d.\n- **The \u201c\\(a^m-1\\) never divides \\(a^n+1\\)\u201d example** (with \\(a\\ge2,m\\ge3\\)): the two-case structure and the reduction to \\(a^r+1\\) is valid.\n\nIf you want, I can also do a second pass that includes the **exercise statements** (to catch any *false* exercise prompts), but for the proved material you posted: **no critical gaps/errors found.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"ac2dd6ce-54d0-4488-9080-9536dd65652e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"ce30a989-6cb8-4687-a384-af1bc5fe018c","turn_exchange_id":"d3af64bc-1a06-4a89-8ea8-0fc41d631022"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"ce30a989-6cb8-4687-a384-af1bc5fe018c","children":[]}}}
