The trick is not to fight that, but to design your work so that:\n\n- boring but necessary tasks are sliced thin and scaffolded  \n- long-running projects have visible progress and novelty  \n- your tendency to chase interesting things is harnessed, not suppressed  \n\nI\u2019ll break this into concrete systems you can actually run.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Reframe: your brain is not \u201clazy\u201d, it is interest-prioritised\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is, in practice, less about \u201clow discipline\u201d and more about:\n\n- **Interest over importance**: your brain allocates attention to \u201cinteresting now\u201d, not \u201cimportant later\u201d.\n- **Low tolerance for friction**: if a task is vague, boring, or has a high activation cost, you will automatically defer it.\n- **Hyperfocus**: when something *is* interesting and well-scoped, you can work longer and deeper than most people.\n\nSo the game is:\n\n> Reduce friction + increase interest + make progress visible.\n\nEverything below is aimed at those three levers.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Kill procrastination at the \u201cactivation energy\u201d stage\n\nMost procrastination happens *before* you start, not after. So focus on making \u201cstarting\u201d stupidly easy.\n\n### 2.1. Always define the next **atomic** action\n\nIf an item on your list is \u201cwork on website\u201d, your brain is right to ignore it \u2014 it is not a task, it is a cloud.\n\nInstead, tasks must be expressed so that you can start them in under 60 seconds.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Bad: \u201cWrite section on Goodhart\u2019s Law.\u201d  \n  Better: \u201cOpen `goodhart.tex` and draft 3 bullet points for subsection 2.1.\u201d\n\n- Bad: \u201cFix SEO on site.\u201d  \n  Better: \u201cOpen homepage HTML and add `<title>` and `<meta description>` based on X.\u201d\n\nMake this a hard rule:  \n> No project is allowed to sit in your system without at least one well-defined **next action**.\n\nYou will find that once you start, you often continue. The job of the system is to get you to \u201cstart\u201d repeatedly.\n\n### 2.2. The five-minute rule (properly)\n\nThe \u201cFive-Minute Rule\u201d is:  \n> Commit not to *finish* a thing, only to do **five minutes**.\n\nUsed correctly, you *lower* the emotional barrier:\n\n- \u201cI must complete this section\u201d \u2192 heavy, aversive  \n- \u201cI only have to poke at this for 5 minutes\u201d \u2192 low threat\n\nSet a timer for 5 minutes and *explicitly* allow yourself to stop once it rings. You usually will not, but knowing you can walk away keeps the panic down.\n\n### 2.3. Make starting a reflex via \u201cif\u2013then\u201d plans\n\nThese are implementation intentions:\n\n- \u201cIf it is 9:30 and I sit at my desk, **then** I open [project file] and do five minutes on the next atomic task.\u201d\n- \u201cIf I finish a lesson, **then** I spend 10 minutes on [long-run project].\u201d\n\nYou are using a fixed cue (time, place, previous action) to automate the otherwise heavy \u201cdecide what to do\u201d step, which is where ADHD often stalls.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Build a project system that respects an ADHD brain\n\nYou are dealing with projects spanning weeks or months. You need a structure that keeps them:\n\n- visible  \n- broken into small chunks  \n- rewarding on short time scales  \n\nThink of this like designing a workflow for a slightly distractible but brilliant PhD student you manage.\n\n### 3.1. One \u201cProject Ledger\u201d as single source of truth\n\nHave *one* place where you track long-run projects (not ten apps):\n\nFor each project:\n\n- Name  \n- One-sentence purpose: \u201cWhy does this exist?\u201d  \n- Current phase (e.g. \u201cExploration / Drafting / Implementation / Polish\u201d)  \n- This week\u2019s one to three concrete goals  \n- Next three atomic actions\n\nThis can be a simple markdown table, Kanban board, or plain list. The key is: your brain should not need to remember anything. Externalise all of it.\n\n### 3.2. Weekly \u201cheartbeat\u201d review (30\u201345 minutes)\n\nOnce per week, you do a **heartbeat**:\n\n- Look at each active long-run project.\n- Ask:\n  - Did I move this forward this week?  \n  - What is the next visible milestone (that fits in ~1 week)?  \n  - What are the next 1\u20133 atomic actions?\n\nUpdate the ledger and schedule **just the next few moves**, not the whole chess game.\n\nThis solves the \u201cI lost the plot of this project, better open Twitter\u201d problem.\n\n### 3.3. Work in short \u201csprints\u201d with a clear \u201cdefinition of done\u201d\n\nBorrow lightly from software:\n\n- Choose 1\u20132 key projects per week.\n- For each, define a **1-week sprint goal** with a precise \u201cdefinition of done\u201d.\n\nExamples:\n\n- \u201cBy Sunday: have a 1-page outline + list of lemmas for the Goodhart paper. Done = outline written in `outline.md` and at least 5 candidate lemmas listed.\u201d\n- \u201cBy Sunday: refactor homepage CSS to use a single colour palette. Done = CSS file updated, screenshots stored, old file backed up.\u201d\n\nYour ADHD brain likes finishing things. You are giving it small finish lines instead of one gigantic, distant one.\n\n### 3.4. Limit work-in-progress (WIP)\n\nWork-In-Progress (WIP) is everything you are trying to actively push forward at once.\n\nADHD + too many parallel projects = constant context switching and no visible completion.\n\nAs a rule:\n\n- Max 2 \u201cheavy\u201d cognitive projects at a time.\n- Others are parked in a \u201cLater / Incubator\u201d list.\n\nYou *can* capture ideas for them, but you do not let them demand real work until one of the active ones is done or reaches a natural pause.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Make long-running work *interesting* to you\n\nYou explicitly said: perseverance is heavily interest-dependent. So design in interest.\n\n### 4.1. Give each project an \u201cintellectual hook\u201d\n\nFor every project, write down a question that actually tickles your brain, not just the instrumental goal.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Tuition website: \u201cWhat is the most elegant way to structure explanations so that a borderline-passing student can \u2018click\u2019 into real understanding with minimal redundancy?\u201d\n- Goodhart\u2019s Law research: \u201cCan I derive a sharp, toy model theorem that actually captures the trade-off between benchmark optimisation and real-world performance?\u201d\n\nPut that hook at the top of the project note. Re-read it at the start of each work block. You\u2019re reminding your brain: *this is not busywork, this is an intellectual problem*.\n\n### 4.2. Prime yourself with micro-research\n\nBefore a work block on a long project:\n\n- Spend 5\u201310 minutes reading something slightly above your current implementation level (a paper, chapter, blog post).\n- Jot 1\u20132 ideas on how it connects to your project.\n\nThis satisfies the curiosity drive and makes the ensuing grind feel like \u201capplying something interesting\u201d instead of \u201cmindless labour\u201d.\n\n### 4.3. Alternate \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cmechanical\u201d tasks\n\nWithin a 60\u201390 minute block:\n\n- Start with 10\u201320 minutes of a cognitively rich task (deriving a lemma, designing an argument, refactoring architecture).\n- Follow with 20\u201330 minutes of more mechanical implementation (typing up, cleaning code, formatting, LaTeX, etc.).\n- Repeat.\n\nThis lets you \u201cpay\u201d for the boring bits with the interest gained from the fun bits.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Time strategy: power blocks, not full rigid schedules\n\nFull calendar time-blocking can fail hard for ADHD; one disruption and the whole scaffolding collapses.\n\nA compromise:\n\n### 5.1. Daily \u201cpower blocks\u201d for deep work\n\nDefine **2 power blocks** per day (they can be 45\u201390 minutes depending on your energy), e.g.:\n\n- 10:00\u201311:15  \n- 16:00\u201317:00  \n\nRules:\n\n- Power blocks are for long-run projects only, no admin.  \n- You choose in advance which project each block is for.  \n- During the block, your only options are:\n  1. Work on the chosen project\u2019s next atomic task, or  \n  2. Stare at the wall / sit there  \n\nNo third option (no email, no phone, no \u201cjust checking news\u201d). Your brain quickly learns that working is less painful than boredom.\n\nThe rest of the day can be flexible: tutoring, errands, reading, small tasks.\n\n### 5.2. \u201cMenu\u201d of tasks instead of fixed micro-scheduling\n\nFor each power block, have a menu of 3\u20135 atomic tasks for that project. When the block starts, pick whichever feels least aversive.\n\nYou keep commitment to **the block and the project**, but allow choice about *which* micro-task. This leverages your need for autonomy without losing direction.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Make it more enjoyable: gamification that is not childish\n\nYou likely do not care about cutesy apps. But you might care about:\n\n- **Streaks**: number of days in a row you touched a key project (even 10 minutes counts).\n- **Points**: assign points to tasks based on difficulty; track weekly totals; try to beat last week.\n- **Progress graphs**: pages written, lemmas proved, lines of code committed, site visits as you ship changes.\n\nThe key is: **visible evidence** that the project is moving. ADHD brains are very responsive to immediate feedback; graphs and streaks make the long-term visible.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Guardrails against distraction (the boring but necessary part)\n\n### 7.1. Environmental design\n\n- Physical: keep your main work zone as \u201csingle-purpose\u201d as possible (desk = work, couch = browsing/reading).\n- Digital:\n  - Close all unrelated tabs before a power block.\n  - Use full-screen mode on editor or PDF.\n  - Consider website blockers during power blocks (for example, apps that block social media / news sites for set periods).\n\nYou are designing a **default** where doing the project is easier than escaping it.\n\n### 7.2. Separate \u201ccapture\u201d from \u201cfollow\u201d\n\nWhen you get a great idea mid-task (\u201cOh, I should read that paper / refactor that other project / Google this tangential thing\u201d):\n\n- Dump it in a quick capture list (notepad, text file, whatever).\n- Do not follow it now; review the capture list at the end of the day or during weekly heartbeat.\n\nThis respects your creativity without allowing it to hijack your current block.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Emotional layer: reduce guilt, increase curiosity\n\nADHD often comes with years of internalised \u201cI should be better at this\u201d frustration. That frustration itself becomes a procrastination trigger.\n\nA few useful mindsets:\n\n- Replace \u201cI must finish this\u201d with \u201cI am curious what happens if I push this forward for 30 minutes.\u201d\n- Treat yourself as a system designer, not a moralising judge.  \n  \u201cThis setup produced distraction; how do I modify the setup?\u201d rather than \u201cWhy am I like this?\u201d\n\nYou will still have \u201coff\u201d days; the point of the system is not perfection, but resilience: even on a low-energy day, you can still knock out one 10\u201315-minute atomic task and keep the project alive.\n\n---\n\n## 9. When to bring in professional or pharmacological support\n\nSince you describe your Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder as mild and non-disruptive to work, lifestyle and systems may already take you far. But it is still worth saying:\n\n- If long-term, important projects keep stalling *despite* good systems\u2026\n- Or if stress, anxiety, or sleep begin to suffer because of unfinished work\u2026\n\n\u2026then it is reasonable to speak with a clinician who understands adult ADHD. They may suggest adjustments ranging from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to medication. That is not a failure of willpower; it is just using another tool.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can help you turn one specific ongoing project into a concrete \u201cledger + sprint + power block\u201d plan, with actual atomic tasks written out so you can test-drive this framework in the real world."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"9833e60d-956a-4508-a54c-d5ef97c93ddb","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"5524b4cd-afa0-46d2-b691-0b259df7fe22","turn_exchange_id":"7aadbc6a-a89d-4110-bb9a-a943133aeb17","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"5524b4cd-afa0-46d2-b691-0b259df7fe22","children":[]}}}
