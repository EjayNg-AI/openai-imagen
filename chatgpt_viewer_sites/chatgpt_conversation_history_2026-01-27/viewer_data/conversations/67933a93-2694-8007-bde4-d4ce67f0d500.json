You also have its Jordan Canonical Form \\(J\\). You want to find the basis of \\(\\mathbb{C}^n\\) (or \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), depending on context) such that \\(A\\) represented in that basis is exactly the Jordan form \\(J\\).\n\nPut another way, you want the invertible matrix \\(P\\) such that\n\\[\nJ \\;=\\; P^{-1} A\\,P,\n\\]\nand the columns of \\(P\\) form the desired basis in which \\(A\\) has the matrix \\(J\\).\n\n---\n\n## Overview of the process\n\n1. **Find the eigenvalues** of \\(A\\).  \n   The Jordan form is built by grouping the eigenvalues along the diagonal in Jordan blocks.\n\n2. **Construct Jordan chains** (or generalized eigenvector chains) for each eigenvalue.  \n   Each Jordan block corresponds to a chain of generalized eigenvectors:  \n   \\[\n   v,\\; (A - \\lambda I)v,\\; \\dots\n   \\]\n   satisfying\n   \\[\n   (A - \\lambda I)^m \\,v = 0 \\quad\\text{for some }m, \\quad\\text{but}\\quad (A - \\lambda I)^{m-1}\\,v \\neq 0.\n   \\]\n   These vectors form a basis for the associated Jordan block. One can think of a chain as \\(\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_m\\}\\) with\n   \\[\n     v_1 \\;\\text{is an eigenvector,} \\quad\n     (A - \\lambda I)v_2 = v_1, \\quad\n     (A - \\lambda I)v_3 = v_2,\\quad \\dots\n   \\]\n   and so on, until \\((A - \\lambda I)v_m = v_{m-1}\\).\n\n3. **Combine all these Jordan chains** for all eigenvalues into a single basis.  \n   The ordered list of generalized eigenvectors \\(\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}\\) becomes the set of columns of \\(P\\). When you do the similarity transform \\(P^{-1}AP\\), you end up with a block-diagonal matrix of Jordan blocks\u2014exactly \\(J\\).\n\n---\n\n## How to \u201cdetermine\u201d the basis specifically\n\nIf you already *know* \\(J\\), you effectively know (1) how many Jordan blocks for each eigenvalue, and (2) the size of each block. From that information, you can read off exactly how many chains (one per Jordan block) you need to construct, and how long each chain is.\n\n### Steps in detail\n\n1. **Identify eigenvalues and block structure**  \n   From \\(J\\), you know the distinct eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k\\). You also know, for each \\(\\lambda_i\\), how many Jordan blocks of each size there are.  \n   For example, if for \\(\\lambda_1\\) you have two Jordan blocks of sizes 2 and 3, that means you need one Jordan chain of length 2 and one Jordan chain of length 3 for that eigenvalue.\n\n2. **Find the actual vectors in each chain**  \n   - **Step 1** (for each Jordan block): Find an eigenvector \\(v_1\\) associated to \\(\\lambda\\). That means solving \\((A - \\lambda I)v_1 = 0\\).  \n   - **Step 2**: For a block of size \\(m\\), you need to find a chain \\(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_m\\) such that:\n     \\[\n     (A - \\lambda I)v_{i+1} = v_i, \n     \\]\n     for \\(i = 1,2,\\ldots,m-1\\).\n\n   Concretely, for \\(v_2\\), you solve \\((A - \\lambda I)v_2 = v_1\\). That means you look for a vector \\(v_2\\) such that applying \\((A - \\lambda I)\\) gives you the already-found eigenvector \\(v_1\\). Once you find \\(v_2\\), you move on to find \\(v_3\\) by solving \\((A - \\lambda I)v_3 = v_2\\), and so on, until you have the entire chain for that block.\n\n3. **Order of the basis vectors**  \n   Conventionally, you list the vectors in chain order (i.e., \\(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_m\\)) for each Jordan block, and then move on to the next block. The columns of \\(P\\) become these vectors in that chosen order, and that ordering yields exactly the Jordan form with blocks along the diagonal.\n\n---\n\n## Why this process works\n\n- In each Jordan block for eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\), the subdiagonal ones are 1, and the diagonal entries are \\(\\lambda\\). Algebraically, that 1 below the diagonal is the reflection of the fact that\n  \\[\n  (A - \\lambda I)v_{i+1} = v_i \\quad (\\text{i.e.\\ shifts the chain down by one step}).\n  \\]\n- By grouping all these chains together, you build a basis in which \\(A\\) has the block-diagonal (Jordan) form.\n\n---\n\n## Final recipe\n\n**Given** a matrix \\(A\\) and its Jordan form \\(J\\):\n\n1. **Read off the Jordan block sizes** for each eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\).  \n2. **For each block** of size \\(m\\):\n   1. Solve \\(\\;(A - \\lambda I)v_1 = 0\\)\\; to get an eigenvector \\(v_1\\).  \n   2. Recursively solve \\(\\;(A - \\lambda I)v_{i+1} = v_i\\)\\; for \\(i = 1,2,\\ldots,m-1\\).  \n3. **Collect** all those vectors \\(\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots \\}\\) in chain order (first for one block, then the next, etc.) into a single list. That list is a basis of \\(\\mathbb{C}^n\\).  \n4. **Form** the matrix \\(P\\) by putting those basis vectors as its columns. Then \\(P^{-1}AP = J\\).\n\nThat\u2019s it\u2014those vectors *are* the basis in which \\(A\\) looks like \\(J\\)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"ab832a89-035f-4ca5-957b-89aed2c99a3c","request_id":"906e25b68c2c9d14-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ab832a89-035f-4ca5-957b-89aed2c99a3c","children":["aaa2dd72-1bfd-491e-a530-79c2252d07a9"]},"aaa2dd72-1bfd-491e-a530-79c2252d07a9":{"id":"aaa2dd72-1bfd-491e-a530-79c2252d07a9","message":{"id":"aaa2dd72-1bfd-491e-a530-79c2252d07a9","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1737732846.887288,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Discuss the example where $A = \\begin{pmatrix} -11 & 9 \\\\ -25 & 19 \\end{pmatrix}$\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"907115eafbf8fd2c-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f1ca2c96-06e2-4ef2-ab69-cf82ad13859e","children":["0f082004-81a4-440d-b9c0-35e7e310f5b9"]},"0f082004-81a4-440d-b9c0-35e7e310f5b9":{"id":"0f082004-81a4-440d-b9c0-35e7e310f5b9","message":{"id":"0f082004-81a4-440d-b9c0-35e7e310f5b9","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1737732948.103167,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Mapping out the characteristic polynomial**\n\nI\u2019m calculating the determinant of \\((A - \\lambda I)\\) to find the characteristic polynomial.

To do this, find the eigenvectors by solving:\n\\[\n(A - 4I)\\,v = 0.\n\\]\nSince \\(\\lambda=4\\), we look at\n\\[\nA - 4I \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n-11-4 & 9 \\\\\n-25 & 19-4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-15 & 9\\\\\n-25 & 15\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nPerform row reduction or solve directly:\n\n- The first row is \\(-15\\,x + 9\\,y = 0\\).\n- The second row is \\(-25\\,x + 15\\,y = 0\\).\n\nNotice the second row is just \\(\\tfrac{5}{3}\\) times the first row, so we effectively have one unique linear equation:\n\\[\n-15x + 9y \\;=\\; 0 \n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n15x \\;=\\; 9y\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\nx \\;=\\; \\tfrac{9}{15}y \\;=\\;\\tfrac{3}{5}y.\n\\]\nChoosing \\(y = 5\\) for convenience gives \\(x = 3\\). An eigenvector is thus\n\\[\nv_1 \\;=\\;\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThis shows the eigenspace is 1-dimensional. Because the eigenvalue 4 has algebraic multiplicity 2 but geometric multiplicity 1, we conclude \\(A\\) is *not* diagonalizable. Instead, it has one Jordan block of size 2.\n\nHence the Jordan form is a single \\(2 \\times 2\\) Jordan block with eigenvalue 4:\n\\[\nJ \\;=\\;\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 1\\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Find the Jordan Basis\n\nTo get \\(A\\) into the Jordan form, we need a chain \\(\\{v_1,v_2\\}\\) of generalized eigenvectors satisfying:\n\\[\n(A - 4I)\\,v_1 = 0 \n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n(A - 4I)\\,v_2 = v_1.\n\\]\n\n1. **We already have** \\(v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\\) as a true eigenvector for \\(\\lambda=4\\).\n\n2. **Find** \\(v_2\\) by solving\n   \\[\n   (A - 4I)\\,v_2 \\;=\\; v_1.\n   \\]\n   Explicitly, we need\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n   -15 & 9\\\\\n   -25 & 15\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   From the first row: \\(-15x + 9y = 3\\). From the second row: \\(-25x + 15y = 5\\).  After a bit of algebra (or row reduction), you\u2019ll find:\n\n   - The two rows are still multiples of each other (just like before), so there is effectively one linear constraint.  \n   - A convenient solution (to make the second row exactly produce \\(\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\\)) arises if you pick \\(y\\) so that the system is satisfied exactly.\n\n   A straightforward approach is to parametrize from the first row:\n\n   \\[\n   -15x + 9y = 3\n   \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; x = \\frac{9y - 3}{15} = \\frac{3}{5}y - \\frac{1}{5}.\n   \\]\n   Then the second row will not impose anything new beyond that the same ratio holds.\n\n   Let\u2019s pick \\(y = 1\\). Then\n   \\[\n   x \\;=\\; \\frac{3}{5}(1)\\;-\\;\\frac{1}{5} \n         \\;=\\;\\frac{2}{5}.\n   \\]\n   So one valid choice is\n   \\[\n   v_2 \\;=\\;\\begin{pmatrix} \\tfrac{2}{5}\\\\[6pt]1\\end{pmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   Check it:\n   \\[\n   (A-4I)\\begin{pmatrix} \\tfrac{2}{5}\\\\[2pt]1\\end{pmatrix}\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\begin{pmatrix}-15 & 9 \\\\ -25 & 15\\end{pmatrix}\n   \\begin{pmatrix} \\tfrac{2}{5}\\\\[2pt]1\\end{pmatrix}\n   =\n   \\begin{pmatrix}-15\\cdot\\tfrac{2}{5} \\,+\\,9\\cdot1\\\\[4pt]-25\\cdot\\tfrac{2}{5} \\,+\\,15\\cdot1\\end{pmatrix}\n   =\n   \\begin{pmatrix}-6 + 9 \\\\ -10 +15\\end{pmatrix}\n   =\n   \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\5\\end{pmatrix} = v_1.\n   \\]\n   Perfect. This satisfies the chain condition exactly.\n\nTherefore, a valid Jordan basis (i.e.\\ generalized eigenvector chain) is\n\\[\nv_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}, \n\\quad\nv_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\tfrac{2}{5} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n> **Remark on scaling.** You can scale the vectors in various ways, but for the canonical Jordan form with a 1 on the superdiagonal, you do need \\((A - 4I)v_2 = v_1\\) *exactly*, not just up to a scalar. That is why \\(v_2\\) often has fractional entries.

Concretely, the Jordan form of \\(C\\) is\n\\[\nJ_C \n\\;=\\;\n\\mathrm{diag}(J_B,\\,J_B)\n\\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 3 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 3 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### 2.2 Jordan basis for \\(C\\)\n\nYou basically take the Jordan basis for the *first* copy of \\(B\\) \u201cin the top\u2010left block\u201d and the Jordan basis for the *second* copy of \\(B\\) \u201cin the bottom\u2010right block.\u201d  More explicitly:\n\n- Let \\(\\{v_1,v_2\\}\\) be the Jordan chain for the *first* \\(B\\) block (as above).\n- Let \\(\\{w_1,w_2\\}\\) be the Jordan chain for the *second* \\(B\\) block.  But it\u2019s the *same matrix* \\(B\\), so you can pick them to be the same type of vectors, just \u201cliving\u201d in a different pair of coordinates.  Concretely, for the second block you can take\n  \\[\n    w_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}, \n    \\quad\n    w_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}.\n  \\]\n  In other words, zero out the first two coordinates, and copy the structure of \\(\\{v_1,v_2\\}\\) into the last two coordinates.\n\nHence a Jordan basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) (or \\(\\mathbb{C}^4\\)) under \\(C\\) is the 4\u2010vector set\n\\[\n\\Bigl\\{\n\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix},\n\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix},\n\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix},\n\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}\n\\Bigr\\}.\n\\]\nThey split into two chains of length 2.  \n\n### 2.3 Conjugating \\(C\\) into its Jordan Form\n\nIf \n\\[\nP_B\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0\\\\\n5 & \\tfrac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\text{solves}\n\\quad\nP_B^{-1} B\\,P_B = J_B,\n\\]\nthen to handle \\(C=\\mathrm{diag}(B,B)\\), just take\n\\[\nP_C\n\\;=\\;\n\\mathrm{diag}(P_B,\\,P_B)\n\\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nP_B & 0\\\\[4pt]\n0 & P_B\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThat is a \\((4\\times4)\\) block\u2010diagonal matrix.  One checks easily that\n\\[\nP_C^{-1}\\;C\\;P_C\n\\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nJ_B & 0\\\\[3pt]\n0 & J_B\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\;=\\;\nJ_C.\n\\]\nEquivalently, you can form the full \\(P_C\\) by placing the four Jordan\u2010chain vectors (two for each block) in the columns:\n\n\\[\nP_C\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n5 & \\tfrac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 5 & \\tfrac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\text{(one possible ordering)}.\n\\]\nEither way, the result is that \\(P_C^{-1} C\\,P_C = \\mathrm{diag}(J_B,\\,J_B)\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Recap of the Process\n\n1. **Solve each diagonal block \\(B\\) independently:**  \n   - Find the eigenvalues and Jordan chains of \\(B\\).  \n   - In this example, \\(B\\) has a single eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=3\\), a single Jordan block of size 2, and thus a 1\u2010dimensional eigenspace.  \n\n2. **Construct the Jordan form of \\(C\\)** by simply stacking or block\u2010diagonalizing the Jordan forms of each copy of \\(B\\).  Because each copy of \\(B\\) is a 2\u00d72 Jordan block for \\(\\lambda=3\\), the final is two 2\u00d72 Jordan blocks for \\(\\lambda=3\\).  \n\n3. **Build a Jordan basis of \\(C\\)** by taking the direct sum of the Jordan bases of each block.  In coordinates, that amounts to zeroing out the \u201cother block\u2019s\u201d entries.  \n\n4. **The matrix \\(P_C\\) that conjugates \\(C\\) to its Jordan form** is \\(\\mathrm{diag}(P_B,P_B)\\) (or equivalently just collecting all four basis vectors in columns).  Then \n   \\[\n   P_C^{-1}\\,C\\,P_C \n   \\;=\\;\n   \\mathrm{diag}(J_B,\\,J_B).\n   \\]\n\nThis completes the illustration for \\(C\\)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"032a9779-94dd-4356-b9de-d744760e2150","request_id":"908cf4f6ddce4d27-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"032a9779-94dd-4356-b9de-d744760e2150","children":[]}}}
