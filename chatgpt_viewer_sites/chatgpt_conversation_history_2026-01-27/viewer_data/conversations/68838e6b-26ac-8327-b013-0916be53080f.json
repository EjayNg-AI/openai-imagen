These 4 careers are already on the chopping block","snippet":"The article explores the current impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market, underscoring that AI is no longer a future threat but a present force reshaping employment across multiple sectors. Citing research from MIT, a New Trader U report predicts that AI will displace 2 million manufacturing workers by 2025. A broader analysis by Goldman Sachs estimates a staggering 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to automation globally. However, the World Economic Forum offers hope, projecting that while 92 million jobs may be eliminated, 170 million new roles could be created by 2030, signifying a transformation rather than a complete loss.\n\nThe article highlights four career domains most at risk: \n1. Administrative and data entry jobs\n2. Customer service roles\n3. Manufacturing and transportation\n4. Entry-level white-collar positions\n\nWhile AI is advancing rapidly in these areas, the article also points out niches where AI still fails to match human capabilities, suggesting that not all roles are equally vulnerable and many may adapt or evolve with technological integration.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753183312.0,"attribution":"economictimes.indiatimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.oecd.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/policy-issues/future-of-work.html","title":"Future of work - OECD","snippet":"Wishing to capture workers' and employers' own perceptions of the current and future impact of AI on their workplaces.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.oecd.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-employment-outlook-2025_194a947b-en/full-report/component-5.html","title":"OECD Employment Outlook 2025: Bouncing back, but on shaky ...","snippet":"Employment rates rose by 0.12 percentage points (to 72.1%) on average in the OECD between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, compared with 0.20 between Q1 ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752019200.0,"attribution":"www.oecd.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.goldmansachs.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent","title":"Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7% - Goldman Sachs","snippet":"Shifts in workflows triggered by these advances could expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation, Briggs and Kodnani ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1680652800.0,"attribution":"www.goldmansachs.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.goldmansachs.com/static-libs/pdf-redirect/prod/index.html?originalQuery=&path=%2Fpdfs%2Finsights%2Fpages%2Ftop-of-mind%2F2023-3-themes-in-charts%2Freport.pdf&referrer=","title":"[PDF] 2023: 3 THEMES IN CHARTS - Goldman Sachs","snippet":"GS GIR economists estimate the impact a $10/bbl rise in Brent crude oil prices would have on inflation and GDP growth across major economies and ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1702857600.0,"attribution":"www.goldmansachs.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.worldbank.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects","title":"Global Economic Prospects - World Bank","snippet":"The latest global economic outlook for 2025 from the World Bank.

The exercises are a visible deterrent intended to signal unified military strength to Beijing amid concerns over China\u2019s assertive posture. Despite the show of force, the alliance is marked by diplomatic tensions, uncertainty about U.S. commitments, and hesitancy among Pacific allies\u2014like Australia and Japan\u2014to formally commit to defending Taiwan due to the lack of binding treaties. Under heavy U.S. pressure, regional partners have cautiously increased military spending and coordination with Taiwan, including participation in joint drills and strategic planning.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned of an imminent Chinese threat to Taiwan while attempting to reassure U.S. allies, whose trust in American commitment has been shaken by President Trump's trade policies and treatment of Ukraine. While European NATO nations have ramped up defense spending, Asian allies remain reluctant. France, Britain, and other NATO members have increased their Pacific presence, as seen in the TALISMAN SABRE exercise. However, internal divisions within the U.S. regarding military posture and fears of escalating tensions persist. The situation remains tense, with ongoing military build-up on both sides and mounting global concern over a potential Taiwan crisis.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753409371.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.spglobal.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/market-insights/geopolitical-risk","title":"Top Geopolitical Risks of 2025 - S&P Global","snippet":"In the Asia-Pacific region, the South China Sea is forecast to experience heightened nonmilitary confrontations, while the Taiwan Strait and Korean Peninsula ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.spglobal.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.crisisgroup.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/10-conflicts-watch-2025","title":"10 Conflicts to Watch in 2025 | International Crisis Group","snippet":"Russia's assault on Ukraine is, judging by President Vladimir Putin's threats, part of a struggle to revise post-Cold War arrangements, and it ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1735689600.0,"attribution":"www.crisisgroup.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.blackrock.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/interactive-charts/geopolitical-risk-dashboard","title":"Geopolitical Risk Dashboard | BlackRock Investment Institute","snippet":"July 2025 | Uncertainty and volatility have become fixtures of ...

AI copilots lower the cost of personalised remediation, but public systems grapple with equity of access.  \n3. **Information integrity.** Generative\u2011AI\u2013driven disinformation spikes during elections; watermarking and provenance protocols are partially effective, but trust in traditional media declines further.  \n4. **Security posture.** Defence budgets rise (2\u202f\u2013\u202f3\u202f% of GDP across OECD, >\u202f5\u202f% in frontline states) to fund drone\u2011swarm, cyber\u2011resilience and space\u2011based ISR platforms, crowding out social spending in fiscally constrained economies.  \n\n---\n\n### 7.\u202fSynthesis: Immediate (2025\u20112028) Outlook  \n\n* **Workforce:** Headcount contracts in routine occupations; net employment effect roughly neutral as creator\u2011economy, AI\u2011ops and green\u2011tech roles absorb part of the slack.  \n* **Wages:** Real wage growth resumes but is capped by global competition and ageing demographics; inequality trajectory hinges on who owns the AI capital stack.  \n* **Economy:** Productivity momentum offsets geo\u2011fragmentation to keep world GDP expanding \u2248\u202f2.5\u20133\u202f% annually \u2014 but with heightened volatility.  \n* **Living standards:** Average consumer surplus from AI services grows, yet the distribution of that surplus is skewed, and non\u2011automatable cost centres prevent a broad\u2011based rise in well\u2011being without policy intervention.  \n* **Society:** Expect sharper debates over social\u2011insurance models, data rights and technological sovereignty, alongside pockets of labour unrest and politicised resistance to automation.  \n\nIn short, the _immediate_ horizon is neither a utopia of leisure nor a dystopia of mass unemployment. It is a contested transition period characterised by **job re\u2011composition, capital concentration, modest aggregate wage gains, and elevated geopolitical and social risk**.
