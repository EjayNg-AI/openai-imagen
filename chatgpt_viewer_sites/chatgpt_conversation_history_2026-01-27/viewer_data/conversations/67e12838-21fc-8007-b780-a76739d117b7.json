Make sure to replace `1234567890` with your own phone number in international format (omit any plus sign or spaces).\n\n- **Opening in a New Tab:**  \n  The attribute `target=\"_blank\"` makes sure the WhatsApp Web opens in a new tab or window, preserving the current page.\n\n- **Accessibility:**  \n  The `alt` attribute on the `<img>` tag ensures that screen readers can describe the icon appropriately.\n\nThis approach is robust and works well on desktop browsers. If you plan to support mobile devices, consider that WhatsApp's API will typically open the WhatsApp app if installed, or revert to WhatsApp Web if not."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini-high","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"c2ed9f42-78f3-4c41-9069-e25ef27fb7d9","request_id":"925532fdd9f34c8f-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c2ed9f42-78f3-4c41-9069-e25ef27fb7d9","children":["a6545fba-8a14-4be5-abff-d28fecfb8903"]},"a6545fba-8a14-4be5-abff-d28fecfb8903":{"id":"a6545fba-8a14-4be5-abff-d28fecfb8903","message":{"id":"a6545fba-8a14-4be5-abff-d28fecfb8903","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1742809397.421,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I would like the icon to be similar to the one on this page: https://www.helpling.com.sg/ , and upon hovering over it with the mouse, the icon is replaced with a bigger one, as per the behaviour on this site."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"system_hints":["search"],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"9255394dda114c8f-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"03d4f3d0-9eef-46f3-adbb-fb10719c30ad","children":["b7a29d7e-dfad-409f-87ea-f7804386e9ad"]},"b7a29d7e-dfad-409f-87ea-f7804386e9ad":{"id":"b7a29d7e-dfad-409f-87ea-f7804386e9ad","message":{"id":"b7a29d7e-dfad-409f-87ea-f7804386e9ad","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1742809414.919773,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini-high","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"a6545fba-8a14-4be5-abff-d28fecfb8903","request_id":"9255394dda114c8f-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"assistant","channel":null},"parent":"a6545fba-8a14-4be5-abff-d28fecfb8903","children":["d414b0ad-e1e6-4fa8-b600-d7a3cad320bf"]},"d414b0ad-e1e6-4fa8-b600-d7a3cad320bf":{"id":"d414b0ad-e1e6-4fa8-b600-d7a3cad320bf","message":{"id":"d414b0ad-e1e6-4fa8-b600-d7a3cad320bf","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1742809403.759093,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Using web tool to analyze icon**\n\nI need to use the web tool to examine the icon behavior on the Helpling website.

In the footer, there's a \"WhatsApp Us\" link. I\u2019m guessing it's either in the header or footer. The user mentioned wanting an icon that changes to a larger one on hover. I don\u2019t see an immediate hover effect, but I\u2019ll assume it\u2019s just a swap of images when hovering. I'll set up an example using HTML and CSS, with two states: a default and a hover state.\n\n**Creating the WhatsApp button**\n\nI\u2019ll write some code using the CSS `background-image` property to create a fixed WhatsApp button that swaps images when hovered. The main idea is to use a button with a small icon that becomes large on hover using two different image files.\n\nI\u2019ll also need to make sure the button stays fixed at the bottom-right corner, even when it grows. Using `transform: scale()` could help, but since the user asked for \u201creplacing\u201d the icon, I\u2019ll stick to swapping the images. Let\u2019s finalize this with the HTML and CSS.\n\n**Deciding how to handle hover effect**\n\nTo swap to a bigger WhatsApp icon on hover, I could resize the image using `transform: scale(1.4)`. However, since the user mentioned wanting a different file for the bigger icon, a CSS background-image swap is simpler to achieve.\n\nI\u2019ll keep the container's size fixed to avoid layout issues but use two images \u2014 one small, one large \u2014 toggling their opacities for the hover effect. I\u2019ll make sure the container stays anchored and doesn\u2019t shift. I'll finalize the HTML and CSS solution."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 36 seconds","initial_text":"Reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini-high","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"b87ebb4b-ae8d-4897-9c3b-85dca8f89c27","request_id":"9255394dda114c8f-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b87ebb4b-ae8d-4897-9c3b-85dca8f89c27","children":["129e481d-426e-4fb9-9bcf-72a3de3f13ac"]},"129e481d-426e-4fb9-9bcf-72a3de3f13ac":{"id":"129e481d-426e-4fb9-9bcf-72a3de3f13ac","message":{"id":"129e481d-426e-4fb9-9bcf-72a3de3f13ac","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1742809426.979247,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Below are two approaches to achieve the effect you\u2019re after. In both cases the icon stays fixed at the bottom right of the page, and when a user hovers over it the icon \u201cgrows\u201d or is swapped with a larger version.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 1: Using CSS Transform (Scaling the Same Image)**\n\nThis method simply enlarges the icon on hover while keeping its bottom\u2011right anchor point fixed. It\u2019s simple and smooth but uses the same image (scaled up).\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <title>WhatsApp Hover Icon (Scale)</title>\n  <style>\n    #whatsapp-link {\n      position: fixed;       /* Keeps the icon in a fixed spot */\n      bottom: 20px;          /* Distance from the bottom */\n      right: 20px;           /* Distance from the right */\n      z-index: 1000;         /* On top of other elements */\n    }\n    #whatsapp-link img {\n      width: 50px;           /* Normal icon size */\n      height: 50px;\n      transition: transform 0.3s ease;\n      transform-origin: bottom right; /* Ensures the bottom right stays anchored */\n    }\n    #whatsapp-link:hover img {\n      transform: scale(1.4); /* Scales the icon to 1.4 times its original size on hover */\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <!-- Your webpage content here -->\n\n  <!-- Clickable WhatsApp icon -->\n  <a id=\"whatsapp-link\" href=\"https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=1234567890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <img src=\"path-to-your-whatsapp-icon.png\" alt=\"Chat on WhatsApp\">\n  </a>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Replace `1234567890` with your phone number in international format (omit the \u201c+\u201d and any spaces).\n- Replace `\"path-to-your-whatsapp-icon.png\"` with the actual path to your WhatsApp icon image.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 2: Using Two Images (Swapping the Icon on Hover)**\n\nThis method uses two image files\u2014one for the normal (smaller) state and one for the hover (bigger) state. The CSS toggles their visibility with a fade effect while keeping the button fixed.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <title>WhatsApp Hover Icon (Image Swap)</title>\n  <style>\n    /* Container for the clickable icon */\n    #whatsapp-link {\n      position: fixed;\n      bottom: 20px;\n      right: 20px;\n      z-index: 1000;\n      /* Setting a fixed area so the button doesn\u2019t shift when images change */\n      width: 50px;\n      height: 50px;\n    }\n    /* Both images are positioned absolutely within the container */\n    #whatsapp-link img {\n      position: absolute;\n      bottom: 0;\n      right: 0;\n      transition: opacity 0.3s ease;\n    }\n    /* Initially, only the small icon is visible */\n    #whatsapp-link .big-icon {\n      opacity: 0;\n      width: 70px;   /* Big icon size */\n      height: 70px;\n    }\n    #whatsapp-link .small-icon {\n      width: 50px;   /* Small icon size */\n      height: 50px;\n      opacity: 1;\n    }\n    /* On hover, swap the visibility */\n    #whatsapp-link:hover .small-icon {\n      opacity: 0;\n    }\n    #whatsapp-link:hover .big-icon {\n      opacity: 1;\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <!-- Your webpage content here -->\n\n  <!-- Clickable WhatsApp icon with image swap on hover -->\n  <a id=\"whatsapp-link\" href=\"https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=1234567890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <img class=\"small-icon\" src=\"path-to-small-icon.png\" alt=\"Chat on WhatsApp\">\n    <img class=\"big-icon\" src=\"path-to-big-icon.png\" alt=\"Chat on WhatsApp\">\n  </a>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Update the `href` link with your own phone number (in international format, without the \u201c+\u201d).\n- Replace `path-to-small-icon.png` and `path-to-big-icon.png` with the paths to your small and larger WhatsApp icon images.\n- The container\u2019s dimensions are set to match the small icon. The bigger icon is allowed to overflow (or you can adjust its positioning) so that the bottom right remains fixed.\n\n---\n\nBoth approaches keep the icon immobile relative to the page and provide a visual cue when the user hovers over it. Choose the method that best fits your design requirements."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini-high","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"a53bf5da-1674-4f02-b8e8-9388d1afd67e","request_id":"9255394dda114c8f-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a53bf5da-1674-4f02-b8e8-9388d1afd67e","children":[]}}}
