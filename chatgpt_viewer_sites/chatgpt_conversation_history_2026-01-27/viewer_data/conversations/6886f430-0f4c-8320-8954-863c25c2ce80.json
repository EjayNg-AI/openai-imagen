Preserving **racial and religious harmony** has been a core principle since independence, enshrined in the national pledge to be \u201cone united people, regardless of race, language or religion.\u201d Today, Singapore is often seen as an **outlier of communal peace**, achieved through deliberate policies and a social compact that balances **multiculturalism with national unity**\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011\u301022\u2020L49-L58\u3011. This report examines the major **governance philosophies**, **policy frameworks**, and **ground initiatives** that promote stability in Singapore\u2019s multiracial, multi-religious society. It also analyzes potential **fault lines** and **global pressures** that could strain this harmony, and proposes **concrete, actionable measures** \u2013 spanning government, community, education and private sectors \u2013 to strengthen social cohesion for the next decade.\n\n## Governance Philosophy: Pragmatism and Multiculturalism \nSingapore\u2019s approach to managing diversity is grounded in **pragmatic multiracialism**. From the outset, national leaders rejected both assimilationist \u201cmelting pot\u201d models and laissez-faire attitudes towards race relations\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011. Instead, the state actively **acknowledges and accommodates different ethnic and religious identities** while emphasizing a common Singaporean identity. Key philosophical pillars include: \n\n- **Multiculturalism with Communitarian Values:** Each ethnic and religious community is encouraged to maintain its culture and heritage, but within a **framework of mutual respect and compromise**. The state practices **\u201ccommunitarian multiculturalism\u201d** \u2013 pluralism that respects differences yet prioritizes social harmony\u301024\u2020L21-L29\u3011. For example, English was adopted as the neutral working language (over Mandarin) to avoid privileging the Chinese majority and to signal that Singapore is *not* a Chinese nation, but a **multicultural society**\u301024\u2020L21-L29\u3011. At the same time, mother-tongue languages (Mandarin, Malay, Tamil) are taught to preserve each community\u2019s culture.\n\n- **Secular Governance with Freedom of Worship:** The government maintains a **strictly secular state** \u2013 no official religion \u2013 but guarantees freedom of religion, intervening only to prevent conflict. **Religious expression is negotiated within boundaries**\u301026\u2020L201-L209\u3011; devotees are free to worship, yet preaching or practices must not denigrate other faiths or threaten public order (as outlined in codes of religious conduct and law). This **secular but faith-friendly** stance allows diverse religions to flourish while keeping any one belief from dominating the public sphere.\n\n- **Trade-offs Between Liberty and Harmony:** A candid aspect of Singapore\u2019s governance philosophy is the **willingness to curtail certain civil liberties** (such as unfettered freedom of speech) to prevent racial or religious strife\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011. Officials argue that given Singapore\u2019s fragile social fabric, **strong laws against hate speech and communal agitation** are a necessary trade-off to avoid the kind of communal violence seen elsewhere\u301022\u2020L49-L58\u3011. As Law Minister K. Shanmugam noted, Singapore does *\u201cnot take a laissez-faire attitude\u201d* but imposes interventions \u201cunacceptable in many other countries\u201d because the risk of communal conflict is existential\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011. While this approach has been effective, younger Singaporeans increasingly question these trade-offs and seek greater openness\u301022\u2020L45-L53\u3011. The government\u2019s challenge is to **justify and fine-tune these measures** in a way that upcoming generations can support, emphasizing that **social cohesion is the bedrock of national survival**\u301022\u2020L49-L58\u3011.\n\n## Key Policy Frameworks Ensuring Harmony \nOver the decades, Singapore has built an **extensive framework of policies, laws, and institutions** to proactively manage race and religious relations. These measures permeate housing, politics, education, law enforcement and community life in a **\u201cwhole-of-government\u201d** and indeed whole-of-society effort. Some of the major components include:\n\n### Housing and Urban Integration \nA cornerstone of Singapore\u2019s harmony is the **Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP)** in public housing. Since 1989, quotas ensure that each neighborhood and apartment block has a mix of ethnic groups roughly in proportion to the national population. This prevents racial enclaves and compels daily **interaction among races as neighbors**. Today, over 80% of residents live in these mixed public housing estates. Public support for this policy is overwhelming \u2013 over 90% of people agree on the **importance of having a racial mix in each housing estate**, according to national surveys\u30105\u2020L1661-L1669\u3011. The EIP has been credited with fostering organic bonds across communities, as children of different races grow up playing together and families celebrate each other\u2019s festivals. While the policy sometimes raises practical issues (e.g. minority families facing limits on selling flats when a quota is full), the government has provided aid (such as additional housing grants) to mitigate such unintended disadvantages \u2013 underscoring a commitment to **integration over segregation**.\n\nBeyond housing, urban planning also supports harmony through **shared public spaces**. Hawker centres, markets, community clubs and parks are intentionally spread across townships to serve all races. Everyone, regardless of background, converges in these spaces for daily activities. Even ethnic-themed precincts (Chinatown, Little India, Geylang Serai) are preserved as cultural heritage zones but remain open and frequented by all Singaporeans. The sight of **multiracial crowds at cultural festivals** \u2013 e.g. Chinese families shopping at the Geylang Serai Ramadan bazaar, or Malay families visiting Chinatown during Lunar New Year \u2013 reflects how policy-guided integration has become a social norm.\n\n### Political Representation and Legal Safeguards \nTo ensure all communities have a **voice in governance**, Singapore\u2019s political system incorporates representation mechanisms. The **Group Representation Constituency (GRC)** scheme, introduced in 1988, mandates that each multi-member electoral constituency team include at least one member of a minority race. This guarantees a minimum number of Malay, Indian or other minority Members of Parliament and prevents an all-Chinese Parliament\u30105\u2020L1675-L1683\u3011. While the GRC system\u2019s side effects are debated, it has ensured minorities are present in elected office, building confidence that **no community is excluded from leadership**.\n\nAt the apex of legislation, the **Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR)** reviews all laws passed by Parliament to ensure they do not discriminate against any racial or religious group. If the Council flags a law as impairing minority rights, it is sent back for reconsideration \u2013 an institutional check that upholds **equal protection for all races** in Singapore\u2019s statutes.\n\nThe office of the **President of Singapore** has also been leveraged to symbolically affirm multiracialism. In 2017, Singapore reserved the presidential election for Malay candidates (after many decades without a Malay head of state), resulting in the election of President Halimah Yacob. Although the move was controversial to some, it **signaled the importance of minority representation at the highest level**. Surveys in subsequent years showed growing acceptance among Chinese Singaporeans of having a minority President or Prime Minister \u2013 rising to ~80% accepting of a Malay or Indian President in 2021, up sharply from about 60% in 2016\u301018\u2020L1659-L1667\u3011\u301018\u2020L1668-L1672\u3011. This suggests that such policies, while top-down, can *\u201cshape racial sentiments and help society achieve greater equality\u201d* over time\u301018\u2020L1668-L1672\u3011.\n\n### Laws and Enforcement Against Hate Incitement \nSingapore has **strict laws to deter racial or religious hatred**, reflecting zero tolerance for speech or actions that threaten harmony. The colonial-era *Sedition Act* (now largely superseded) and sections of the Penal Code long criminalized acts that promote enmity between races or insult religion. In recent years, these provisions have been consolidated and strengthened under new legislation:\n\n- The **Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA)**, enacted in 1990 and enhanced in 2019, empowers authorities to swiftly restrain or sanction any person (including religious preachers) who cause ill-will between faiths\u30107\u2020L1-L8\u3011. Under the MRHA, a minister can issue a restraining order to stop a preacher from delivering divisive sermons or to bar publications that incite religious conflict. The Act also established a **Presidential Council for Religious Harmony** to advise on such orders. In October 2019, amendments updated the MRHA for the digital age \u2013 for example, explicitly covering online communications and allowing swifter action to prevent viral spread of harmful content\u30108\u2020L218-L227\u3011\u30108\u2020L231-L240\u3011.\n\n- In 2021, Singapore introduced a complementary **Maintenance of Racial Harmony Bill** (passed in 2022) to address race-based incidents with similar powers. This new law **consolidates all race-related offences and powers** in one legislation\u30108\u2020L231-L239\u3011. It allows authorities to issue **\u201cracial harmony restraining orders\u201d** to stop the circulation of offensive racial content or speech *immediately*, recognizing that viral misinformation or hate speech can *\u201ccause irreparable harm to social cohesion\u201d* if not halted swiftly\u30108\u2020L218-L226\u3011\u30108\u2020L231-L240\u3011. Offences like inciting racial hatred, making racist threats or insults have been ported from the Penal Code into this Act, with **updated penalties and extraterritorial reach** (so even someone overseas can be prosecuted if they target Singapore\u2019s racial harmony online)\u30108\u2020L239-L248\u3011. \n\n- Notably, the Maintenance of Racial Harmony law also introduced a novel **\u201cCommunity Remedial Initiative\u201d** for first-time or low-severity offenders\u30108\u2020L253-L262\u3011. Instead of straight prosecution, an offender who, say, uttered a racial slur could be asked to attend remedial programs \u2013 e.g. diversity workshops, community service with the aggrieved group \u2013 to *learn from and make amends* for their actions\u30108\u2020L255-L263\u3011. Successful completion of such a program may be taken into account by prosecutors (potentially foregoing formal charges)\u30108\u2020L259-L267\u3011. This approach recognizes that **healing and education**, not just punishment, are crucial in repairing inter-communal ties after racist incidents.\n\nIn tandem with these specific laws, broader legislation fortifies the defense against extremist or hateful agitation. The **Internal Security Act (ISA)** continues to be used to detain or place restrictions on individuals plotting religious or racial violence (e.g. self-radicalized terrorists). The **Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA)** (2019) and the **Online Safety Act** (2022) empower authorities to compel removal or corrections of online content that *\u201ccould incite racial and religious tensions\u201d*\u301029\u2020L138-L147\u3011\u301029\u2020L140-L148\u3011. These tools enable a quick response to **misinformation or inflammatory material** before it sparks discord. For instance, the government has invoked these powers to debunk rumors with racial overtones and to block preachers of hate on social media. Singapore has also enacted the **Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA)** to counter hostile information campaigns by foreign actors, which includes scenarios where foreign agents might exploit racial or religious fault lines to destabilize society\u301029\u2020L124-L133\u3011\u301029\u2020L127-L134\u3011.\n\nWhile such laws have drawn criticism from free-speech advocates, the government stresses they are wielded **surgically to prevent communal conflict**, not to suppress legitimate expression. Indeed, surveys show the vast majority of Singaporeans *approve* of firm government action in this realm \u2013 nearly 94% agree the state has done well to improve racial and religious harmony\u30103\u2020L1613-L1621\u3011\u30103\u2020L1615-L1623\u3011. Still, authorities temper enforcement with community consultation and independent oversight (e.g. restraining orders under harmony laws must be reviewed by the Presidential Council and confirmed by the President). The overarching goal is a **protective legal environment** where **harmony is vigilantly safeguarded**, without stifling open discussion that is respectful. \n\n### Education and Youth Initiatives \nSingapore\u2019s education system is a **key pillar in inculcating interracial and interreligious understanding** from young. Schools are intentionally **mixed**, drawing students from all backgrounds under a common curriculum. Starting in primary school, students recite the national pledge (\u201cregardless of race, language or religion\u201d) daily and learn about each culture through **Social Studies and Character & Citizenship Education** lessons. The syllabus highlights the nation\u2019s history of racial strife (e.g. the 1964 racial riots) and teaches the importance of unity and respect as lessons learned.\n\nA signature program is **Racial Harmony Day**, commemorated annually on 21 July (the anniversary of the 1964 riots). On this day, schools hold cultural appreciation activities \u2013 students often wear ethnic costumes, share traditional foods, and perform songs or dances of different cultures. These celebrations drive home the message that **Singapore\u2019s diversity is a strength to cherish, not a weakness**. Over time, Racial Harmony Day has become part of the national culture itself (much like National Day), often extending to workplaces and community events as well\u301026\u2020L175-L183\u3011.\n\nBeyond the classroom, **youth engagement programs** foster cross-cultural friendships. Uniformed groups, sports teams, and arts clubs in schools are deliberately heterogeneous. Co-curricular activities and school camps group students of different races together to work on common goals. National Service (the mandatory military service for 18-year-old males) is another *\u201cgreat leveller\u201d* \u2013 recruits from all races train and live together, forging bonds that often last a lifetime across ethnic lines. These shared experiences help **break down stereotypes and build camaraderie** through daily teamwork and camaraderie.\n\nHigher education and youth organizations also contribute. Universities host forums on race, religion and society; student unions often celebrate festivals of all cultures on campus. Youth-led initiatives, sometimes supported by the government or NGOs like *OnePeople.sg*, organize interfaith dialogues, heritage trails, and community projects that bring together young people from different communities. The government, for its part, has been **expanding National Education** programs to not only instill patriotism but also to candidly discuss social issues like racism or religious sensitivities with students in secondary and tertiary institutions. By equipping the next generation with **knowledge, empathy and critical thinking**, Singapore hopes to **further diminish prejudice** and raise a cohort that takes harmony as a given.\n\n### Community and Civil Society Involvement \nSingapore\u2019s harmony is also maintained through active **community-level engagement and surveillance of tensions**, often termed a \u201c**whole-of-society**\u201d effort. Key players here include:\n\n- **Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs):** These are local-level interfaith networks in every constituency, instituted in 2002. IRCCs consist of religious leaders (from churches, mosques, temples, gurdwaras, etc.), grassroots activists, and community volunteers. They meet regularly to build rapport, learn about each other\u2019s customs, and collaborate on community service projects. Crucially, IRCCs act as **first responders to potential discord** \u2013 should a racial/religious incident occur, these pre-existing relationships enable quick outreach to calm sentiments and clarify misunderstandings. IRCC members often jointly visit schools or hold public dialogues to promote understanding. This *ground-up interfaith diplomacy* strengthens trust at the everyday community level.\n\n- **Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO):** Founded in 1949, the IRO is one of Singapore\u2019s oldest civil society groups, comprising representatives of 10 major religions. It regularly organizes interfaith prayers, heritage tours of different places of worship, and issues joint statements promoting tolerance. The IRO drafted the **Declaration of Religious Harmony** in 2003 (after the SARS crisis and post-9/11 climate) which is recited in some events. The IRO\u2019s longstanding motto \u2013 *\u201cDifferent Paths, One Destination\u201d* \u2013 epitomizes the spirit of unity amid diversity. It works closely with government agencies to advise on interfaith matters and to mediate if any inter-religious misunderstanding arises.\n\n- **OnePeople.sg:** This is a national-level advocacy group for racial harmony, established in 1997 (initially as Community Development Councils\u2019 project and later under the Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth). OnePeople.sg conducts public education campaigns, hosts youth workshops, and honours champions of harmony (for instance through awards). It partnered with the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) to create **harmony indicators and surveys** that track the state of interracial relations over time\u30105\u2020L1659-L1667\u3011. Such data-driven monitoring helps identify areas of concern to address. OnePeople.sg also runs an annual **Harmony Works! Conference** and hackathons that invite young Singaporeans to brainstorm new approaches to strengthen cohesion. By functioning as a bridge between **research, policy and community action**, it ensures that policies remain responsive to people\u2019s experiences on the ground.\n\n- **Self-Help Community Groups:** Uniquely, Singapore supports ethnic-based self-help groups (SHGs) that address socio-economic disparities within each community. These include **Mendaki** (for Malays/Muslims), **CDAC** (Chinese Development Assistance Council), **SINDA** (for Indians), and the **Eurasian Association**. While at first glance they are race-specific, their existence is *complementary* to harmony efforts \u2013 by uplifting weaker segments in each community (through tuition programs, job training, financial aid), the SHGs help ensure **no racial group feels left behind** in development. This reduces the risk of inter-ethnic resentment over inequality. The government provides funding and coordination, and importantly, all SHGs have open programs and cross-share expertise (e.g., a disadvantaged child of any race can benefit from the tuition programs). Surveys find over 90% of Singaporeans agree on *\u201cproviding culturally sensitive help to the less well-off in different communities\u201d* as an important policy outcome\u30105\u2020L1661-L1669\u3011. In essence, **multiracial harmony is underpinned by multiracial social support** \u2013 each community takes care of its vulnerable, contributing to overall stability.\n\n- **Religious Guidance and Codes:** Singapore actively partners with religious authorities to keep teachings conducive to harmony. For instance, the Islamic authority MUIS operates an **Asatizah (religious teachers) Certification Scheme**, requiring all Muslim clerics and teachers to be certified in a Code of Ethics that mandates **promoting tolerance and avoiding extremism**\u301026\u2020L162-L170\u3011\u301026\u2020L171-L179\u3011. Preachers who breach this (by denigrating other faiths or pushing exclusivist ideologies) can be barred from preaching. Similarly, Christian organizations like the National Council of Churches remind member churches to exercise caution when inviting foreign speakers, after cases where foreign preachers had expressed inflammatory views abroad\u301026\u2020L177-L185\u3011\u301026\u2020L181-L189\u3011. These measures show a **civil society taking ownership** of harmony: religious communities policing their own to prevent narratives that could \u201cerode the social fabric of Singapore\u201d\u301026\u2020L171-L179\u3011. The government has indeed banned entry to a handful of foreign clerics \u2013 both Muslim and Christian \u2013 who had records of preaching hatred\u301026\u2020L175-L183\u3011\u301026\u2020L177-L185\u3011. But as experts note, many such sermons are available online, so ultimately **the faithful must exercise discernment**\u301026\u2020L212-L220\u3011\u301026\u2020L238-L246\u3011. Both government and religious leaders emphasize educating individuals to uphold **critical thinking, respect and tolerance as core values** so they are less susceptible to divisive rhetoric\u301026\u2020L239-L247\u3011. \n\nCollectively, these community initiatives cultivate **trust networks and a culture of vigilance** that buttress formal policies. They create spaces for Singaporeans to interact positively across lines of race and religion, and to address grievances or misconceptions before these fester. This whole-of-society mobilization is part of Singapore\u2019s **\u201cTotal Defence\u201d**, specifically the **Social Defence** and **Psychological Defence** pillars \u2013 recognizing that every citizen plays a part in guarding harmony, just as they do in military or civil emergencies\u30106\u2020L17-L20\u3011.\n\n### Private Sector and Workplace Inclusion \nIn the private sector, there is growing recognition that **businesses and employers have roles in promoting multiracial harmony**. Key areas of progress include: \n\n- **Workplace Fairness and Diversity:** The government, in partnership with employer associations and unions, set up the **Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP)**, which issues guidelines barring discrimination by race or religion in hiring and career practices. Employers are encouraged to hire based on merit and to reflect Singapore\u2019s diversity in their workforce. It is now **illegal for job ads to specify race preferences**, and TAFEP investigates complaints of bias (with errant employers facing warnings or curtailment of work pass privileges). In 2021, the government announced that these guidelines will be **enshrined in law** \u2013 a new Workplace Fairness Act is being drafted to give such rules legal teeth\u301018\u2020L1703-L1711\u3011\u301018\u2020L1706-L1714\u3011. This move was welcomed as it **provides clarity, stronger enforcement, and protection for those who report discrimination**\u301018\u2020L1703-L1711\u3011\u301018\u2020L1706-L1714\u3011. It directly addresses issues such as minorities feeling they lost job opportunities due to race \u2013 an experience about 1 in 5 Malays and Indians reported in surveys (often due to unnecessary language criteria)\u301018\u2020L1678-L1686\u3011. By tackling workplace discrimination head-on, Singapore aims to ensure **equal opportunity for all races**, reducing a source of resentment and making diversity a competitive strength.\n\n- **Corporate Culture and Training:** Many companies, especially multinationals in Singapore, have adopted **Diversity & Inclusion training** and multicultural workplace policies. Staff are often given training on cultural sensitivity (e.g. understanding religious dietary needs or festivals), and some firms hold internal celebrations for Racial Harmony Day or religious holidays to educate employees. Informally, Singapore\u2019s multiracial social norms carry into offices \u2013 colleagues of different races lunch together, and it\u2019s common to see workplaces arranging halal food options for company events or rotating holiday greetings of all faiths. These everyday practices in the private sector reinforce the idea that **in Singaporean life, inclusivity is routine**.\n\n- **Media and Advertising Standards:** The media and creative industry have been steered toward **responsible representation** of different races and religions. The national broadcaster and advertising authorities, often guided by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), have guidelines to avoid negative stereotypes. This became salient after a 2019 incident where an advertisement used \u201cbrownface\u201d (an actor portrayed multiple races with skin darkening), causing public outcry. The lesson spurred greater awareness in media companies to **cast talents from the actual ethnic groups** and to consult cultural advisers for sensitivities. Popular media \u2013 TV shows, news, print \u2013 also carry content celebrating racial harmony, such as multicultural festival specials or profiles of interfaith friendships, which shape public consciousness positively. The **Singapore Kindness Movement**, an NGO often supported by corporate sponsors, runs public campaigns (posters, short films on social media) promoting respect and graciousness across communities. Such private-public collaborations leverage marketing savvy to **promote pro-harmony social messages**.\n\n- **Inclusive Business Practices:** Some private sector initiatives go further, for example **supplier diversity programs** that include minority-owned businesses, or mentorship schemes targeting disadvantaged minority youth for internships. While not as developed as in some countries, a few companies in Singapore have begun volunteering at minority community centers or sponsoring cultural events as part of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). These efforts, though nascent, signal that **social cohesion is everyone\u2019s business** \u2013 literally \u2013 and contribute to a broader ecosystem of inclusion beyond what government alone can mandate.\n\nOverall, the private sector\u2019s role complements public efforts: by **ensuring fairness and mixing in economic life**, it prevents communal enclaves from forming in the workplace or market. A person of any race can expect to be treated fairly when seeking a job, opening a bank account, or walking into a mall. This consistent experience of **equal treatment in daily transactions** reinforces trust in the multiracial system.\n\n## Current Fault Lines and Emerging Challenges \nDespite the robust frameworks, Singapore is not immune to **tensions or challenges that test racial-religious harmony**. The government has frequently highlighted **\u201cfault lines\u201d** in society that could be exploited if left unmanaged. A major study by IPS in 2024 reaffirmed five key fault line areas: **race, religion, immigration, socioeconomic class, and LGBT issues**\u30103\u2020L1626-L1634\u3011. Of these, race and religion remain the most sensitive, with the public perceiving that if mishandled they could most likely lead to **anger, polarization or even violence**\u30105\u2020L1705-L1713\u3011\u30105\u2020L1714-L1718\u3011. Below we examine the prominent fault lines and the **global pressures** amplifying them today:\n\n- **Racial Fault Lines:** **Racial prejudices and inequalities** persist under the surface of official harmony. Minority groups (Malays, Indians, Eurasians and others) have periodically voiced experiences of discrimination or bias \u2013 be it in hiring (as noted, 20% of minorities felt they lost job opportunities due to race)\u301018\u2020L1678-L1686\u3011, in everyday encounters (derogatory comments or stereotyping), or under-representation in certain elite institutions. There is also rising awareness of **\u201cChinese privilege\u201d** in Singapore\u2019s context \u2013 analogous to majority privilege elsewhere \u2013 where minorities may feel subtle exclusion in a Chinese-majority environment (e.g. casual use of Mandarin in mixed settings, or fewer role models in top corporate leadership). On the other side, some in the Chinese majority feel uncomfortable with too much focus on race issues, worrying that open conversations on racism might themselves create friction. Indeed, an IPS survey found slightly over half of respondents were *\u201ctired of talking about race and racism\u201d*, yet paradoxically a large majority also wanted political leaders to **talk openly about racism to resolve problems**, and younger Singaporeans especially desired more dialogue\u301018\u2020L1759-L1767\u3011. This reflects a generational shift: **younger, better-educated Singaporeans are more aware of racial issues and less accepting of racial insensitivity**, which means historical \u201charmony\u201d norms (like politely ignoring racial issues) are being challenged\u30102\u2020L16-L19\u3011. Several high-profile racist incidents around 2020\u20132021 \u2013 such as videos of individuals using racial slurs or harassing people of other races \u2013 went viral, prompting national soul-searching. While these incidents were condemned by the vast majority, they exposed fault lines like **inter-ethnic dating (Chinese-Indian couples facing abuse)** and prejudice against migrant workers. The government responded firmly (investigating and charging offenders where possible, and emphasizing such behavior is unacceptable), but the incidents underscored that **harmony can be fragile if taken for granted**.\n\n- **Religious Fault Lines:** Singapore enjoys generally good inter-religious relations, but there are potential divides. One is **religious conservatism vs secular norms** \u2013 for instance, some conservative Christian and Muslim groups have felt their values (regarding issues like LGBT rights or alcohol/gambling in society) are at odds with secular government policies, which could create friction if not delicately managed. The recent repeal of Section 377A (the law criminalizing gay male sex) in 2022 was a case where the government had to balance **religious sensitivities with civil liberties**\u301029\u2020L148-L157\u3011. It did so by simultaneously affirming the traditional legal definition of marriage to assuage religious groups, demonstrating a **pragmatic compromise to keep social peace**\u301029\u2020L151-L158\u3011\u301029\u2020L153-L157\u3011. Another fault line is **exclusive truth claims** inherent in religion \u2013 if adherents aggressively proselytize or denounce other faiths as false, it can cause conflict. This is why Singapore regulates proselytization and why religious teachers are constantly reminded to preach sensitivity\u301026\u2020L201-L209\u3011\u301026\u2020L211-L219\u3011. There have been isolated incidents: e.g., in 2017 a foreign imam was deported after he prayed for victory against Jews and Christians \u2013 an act deemed prejudicial to religious harmony\u301010\u2020L5-L13\u3011. Conversely, remarks by non-Muslims that disrespect Islam (like a teenager\u2019s offensive social media post) have also caused tensions historically. *Any* terror incident or sectarian violence abroad also threatens to inflame local religious passions. Overall, **vigilance against extremism** is vital \u2013 the government has detected and detained self-radicalized individuals (mostly influenced by Islamist terror propaganda), and more recently even a case of a youth influenced by far-right Christian white supremacy (detailed below)\u301011\u2020L362-L371\u3011\u301011\u2020L369-L377\u3011. Such cases reveal that **religious or ideological extremism \u2013 whether jihadist or crusader \u2013 could tear our social fabric if not intercepted early**.\n\n- **Immigration and Nativism:** As a global city, Singapore has a large non-citizen population (foreign workers, professionals, expatriates). Locals sometimes perceive *\u201cforeigners\u201d* as a separate group, and when foreigners belong largely to one ethnicity or nationality, tensions can take on a racial hue. For example, the influx of mainland Chinese migrants in the 2000s led to some frictions between local Chinese and PRC Chinese (over cultural differences and competition for jobs). Similarly, South Asian migrant workers have faced xenophobic attitudes from some Singaporeans, sometimes viewed through a racial lens. An incident during COVID-19 saw a spike in cases among migrant worker dormitories, and there were public debates that occasionally strayed into **\u201cus vs them\u201d rhetoric** about South Asian workers. The government has identified **integration of immigrants** as a priority \u2013 programs like the National Integration Council encourage PRs and new citizens to learn local norms, and grassroots \u201cIntegration Ambassadors\u201d help introduce them to neighbors. Still, in times of economic uncertainty, **anti-immigrant sentiment can rise** and potentially morph into racial intolerance (since immigrants often form ethnic enclaves by nationality). In the IPS survey, immigration was noted as a fault line, though slightly fewer people in 2024 saw it as requiring more government intervention compared to 2018\u30103\u2020L1626-L1634\u3011\u30105\u2020L1647-L1655\u3011. One reason is likely improvements in policies (tightening certain foreign worker quotas, and clearer pathways for high-skilled foreigners to contribute). Nonetheless, **global pressures on migration** \u2013 from economic shifts or climate refugees \u2013 could bring new waves of migrants, testing Singaporeans\u2019 openness. Managing locals\u2019 perceptions and ensuring **immigrants adapt to local multicultural norms** will remain crucial to prevent an immigration issue from becoming a communal issue.\n\n- **Socioeconomic Inequality Across Groups:** Economic class is another latent fault line, and in Singapore it intersects somewhat with race. Malays have the lowest median income among major races, and a higher percentage of Indians face poverty than Chinese. If not addressed, **relative deprivation can fuel a sense of racial grievance**, undermining harmony. For instance, if one race is seen as dominating the top wealth brackets while another struggles, historical resentments can grow. The government\u2019s strategy has been to tackle inequality vigorously through education, skills training, and social support, often targeting help in a race-neutral way but with an eye on uplifting communities that are lagging. The ethnic self-help groups (Mendaki, etc.) play a part here. Fortunately, surveys indicate a strong majority of Singaporeans across races believe **racial diversity is beneficial** and trust among races has risen in recent years\u301020\u2020L13-L16\u3011\u301020\u2020L23-L28\u3011. But the same surveys caution that **perceptions of unfairness \u2013 such as unequal hiring or housing disadvantages \u2013 can erode trust** if unresolved. Thus, maintaining harmony requires **bridging economic gaps** so that all groups share in Singapore\u2019s progress.\n\n- **Global Extremism and Imported Conflicts:** In an increasingly connected world, **external events and ideologies can reverberate within Singapore**, stoking local tensions. The recent war between Israel and Hamas (2023\u20132024) is a prime example. Singapore\u2019s Muslim community is naturally sympathetic to the Palestinian plight, while other communities may have diverse views or feel removed from the conflict. As graphic war content floods social media, there is a risk of people becoming emotionally radicalized. Indeed, a 56-year-old Singaporean woman (Hamizah Hamzah) was placed on a Restriction Order in Jan 2025 for supporting and glorifying the militant actions of groups like Hamas online\u301013\u2020L392-L400\u3011\u301013\u2020L436-L444\u3011. She had become so engrossed in the conflict that it led to extremism. Such cases show how **distant conflicts can sow local divisions** \u2013 e.g. if communal groups take opposing sides, mistrust can form. Another case from late 2020 was a *Singaporean teen radicalized by far-right propaganda* from the West: he was inspired by a white supremacist ideology (the \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d theory) and idolized the New Zealand mosque shooter. This 18-year-old plotted to attack a local mosque to spark a \u201crace war,\u201d fearing (in absurd fashion) that the Chinese majority was at risk of being \u201creplaced\u201d by Muslims\u301011\u2020L362-L370\u3011\u301011\u2020L369-L377\u3011. He was fortunately arrested under ISA before he could harm anyone\u301011\u2020L353-L361\u3011\u301011\u2020L364-L372\u3011. The case is chilling \u2013 a **cross-pollination of Western far-right extremism into Asia**, illustrating that *both* jihadist and far-right threats are globalizing. Experts warn that **far-right extremism is likely to grow worldwide**, fueled by hate narratives in Western politics, and could influence susceptible individuals here\u301011\u2020L375-L383\u3011\u301011\u2020L377-L385\u3011. At the same time, Islamist terrorist propaganda (ISIS, Al-Qaeda, etc.) continues to seek recruits online. Singapore\u2019s small size and high connectivity make it porous to such **ideological contagion via the internet**. \n\n- **Social Media and Echo Chambers:** Amplifying all the above is the role of **social media**, which can act as an echo chamber for polarizing views. Unlike in the past when discourse was moderated by mainstream media, today **online platforms can rapidly spread misinformation, racist memes, or extremist content**. For instance, rumors that stoke racial fears (like false claims of crime by a certain race) can go viral and sow discord if not quickly debunked. The government has used POFMA to counter some falsehoods of this nature, but the volume of content is immense. Moreover, even well-meaning individuals may share overseas incidents of racial injustice (like police violence in another country) that then provoke local anger or anxiety, even if the local context is different. **Prolonged exposure to toxic online content** \u2013 what some call \u201cdoomscrolling\u201d \u2013 can increase one\u2019s sense of grievance or even lead to self-radicalization\u301013\u2020L424-L432\u3011\u301013\u2020L434-L442\u3011. The pandemic period saw an uptick in people consuming extreme content while isolated, a trend that security agencies worldwide noted. \n\nIn summary, Singapore\u2019s harmony, while robust, faces **evolving challenges**: internal issues like subtle discrimination or intercultural misunderstandings, and external pressures like extremist ideologies and divisive global narratives. The next 10 years are likely to be *\u201cstormy\u201d* in the realm of identity politics globally \u2013 with potentially more **ethno-nationalist movements, geopolitical religious strife, and migratory shifts**. Singapore must therefore **anticipate and guard against these shocks**, strengthening its social cohesion **muscles** much as one would reinforce defences before a storm.\n\n## Strategies for a Resilient and Inclusive Future \nTo prepare Singapore for a more challenging global climate of race and religion tensions, a **holistic, forward-looking strategy** is needed. This strategy should consolidate successful current policies while addressing gaps and emerging issues through new initiatives. Crucially, it must be a **whole-of-government and whole-of-nation approach** \u2013 coordinated across different ministries and engaging the community, private sector, and religious/civic groups. Below are **concrete, actionable measures** recommended to fortify Singapore\u2019s harmony over the next decade, categorized by domain:\n\n### 1. Strengthen Policy Frameworks and Update Laws \n- **Regularly Review and Adapt Integration Policies:** Singapore should continually **assess the relevance of policies like the Ethnic Integration Policy and CMIO framework**, to ensure they meet evolving needs\u30105\u2020L1683-L1691\u3011\u30105\u2020L1687-L1690\u3011. For instance, with more inter-ethnic marriages (and mixed-race children), the government could refine the CMIO race classification to be more inclusive (e.g. allowing flexible multi-racial identities in forms instead of rigid categories). The ethos of ensuring no enclaves and representation must remain, but *how* it\u2019s executed can be adjusted with public consultation. Periodic reviews \u2013 perhaps every 5 years \u2013 can gauge public sentiment (as IPS surveys do) to decide if tweaks are needed without abandoning the framework that most feel has worked\u30105\u2020L1675-L1683\u3011\u30105\u2020L1679-L1687\u3011. Such calibration will keep policies effective and legitimate for new generations.\n\n- **Fully Implement the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act:** Once in force, the new racial harmony law\u2019s provisions (restraining orders, community remedial initiatives, foreign influence safeguards) should be proactively utilized and publicized. Authorities should not hesitate to swiftly **issue restraining orders (ROs)** to quash virulent racist content before it gains traction\u30108\u2020L218-L227\u3011. At the same time, the **Community Remedial Initiative (CRI)** can be promoted as a restorative justice tool \u2013 for example, if a racist incident occurs in a school or workplace, the offender could be directed into a CRI program to learn about the other community, do service with them, and publicly affirm lessons learnt. Early success stories of CRI can be shared to demonstrate its value in healing divides. A panel of community mediators or counselors (drawn from OnePeople.sg, etc.) could be trained to facilitate these remedial programs. Over 10 years, this approach may turn many ugly incidents into opportunities for reconciliation, reinforcing norms against racism.\n\n- **Enact Comprehensive Anti-Discrimination Legislation:** Building on the upcoming workplace anti-discrimination law, Singapore can consider a **broader Equal Opportunities Act** that addresses unfair treatment not just at work but in areas like housing rental, education, and provision of services. This law can prohibit discrimination on grounds of race or religion (among other characteristics) in these domains, with a tribunal for grievances. Many multiracial societies (e.g. UK, Canada) have such omnibus laws. A carefully tailored Singapore version, enforced by a small Equal Opportunities Commission, would signal that *beyond jobs*, **any form of racial/religious discrimination is illegal**. Even if formal complaints are few, the law serves a normative purpose. This must be pursued pragmatically \u2013 perhaps starting with guidelines and gradually formalizing rights \u2013 to avoid excessive litigation. But given minorities\u2019 real experiences (like rental market bias), it could fill an important gap in ensuring **all individuals feel protected in daily life**.\n\n- **Embed Social Harmony in National Crisis Planning:** Update Singapore\u2019s **Total Defence and emergency response plans** to explicitly include scenarios of communal strife (e.g. a riot, terror attack targeting a particular faith, or mass protest over an overseas conflict). Conduct **multi-agency exercises** that simulate these events: the police, Internal Security Department, community leaders (IRCC heads), and media officers should practice coordinated response to quell rumors and prevent escalation. By stress-testing the system, any weak links (like slow public communication or lack of community liaison) can be fixed. In the next decade, given global uncertainties, *anticipating the worst* will ensure the nation is *\u201charmony-ready\u201d* even under stress.\n\n### 2. Proactively Counter Extremism and Online Hate \n- **Enhance Digital Literacy and Critical Thinking:** A national campaign to boost **media literacy** should be expanded, teaching citizens how to identify misinformation, extremist propaganda, and echo chambers online. The education ministry can integrate *\u201ccritical consuming of social media\u201d* modules in school curricula and National Service. Community centers can hold workshops for older adults on spotting fake news and hateful content. Given cases of self-radicalization via online content\u301013\u2020L436-L444\u3011\u301013\u2020L438-L447\u3011, it\u2019s crucial to **inoculate the population against toxic narratives**. One practical idea is a *\u201cHarmony Online\u201d* toolkit \u2013 short videos or interactive apps that show scenarios of how social media can mislead and how to verify information or seek alternate perspectives. Promoting a habit of **balanced online engagement** (limiting doomscrolling, following diverse voices) can help reduce the risk of one-sided radicalization\u301013\u2020L424-L432\u3011\u301013\u2020L428-L436\u3011.\n\n- **Strengthen Monitoring and Early Intervention:** Security agencies should continue to **monitor online spaces (dark web, forums, social media groups)** where racial or religious hate might brew. But beyond government surveillance, *community reporting mechanisms* need to be user-friendly. The government can work with tech companies to implement easy in-app reporting for hate speech or extremist content \u2013 e.g. a \u201cReport Hate\u201d button that users can click if they see someone in Singapore posting dangerous content. Reports can be triaged by a multi-agency taskforce (comprising police, cyber security, psychologists) that decides on intervention \u2013 whether it\u2019s content takedown, a knock on the door and counseling for the individual, or legal action for serious cases. The **community too must be vigilant**: peers, family, or religious mentors who observe someone drifting into extremist ideology should feel empowered to alert authorities or local intervention programs *before* a crime is committed. Singapore\u2019s Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) \u2013 clerics who counsel radicalized detainees \u2013 could extend their outreach online, engaging individuals who express troubling views and guiding them back to moderation. Essentially, build an \u201cimmune system\u201d where **society self-polices extremism early**.\n\n- **Counter Narratives and Positive Messaging:** To compete with the loud negativity online, Singapore can amplify **authentic narratives of harmony**. This might involve training and supporting credible voices \u2013 e.g. popular youth influencers, respected religious scholars, minority success figures \u2013 to speak up for unity and debunk extremist or racist arguments. Short video series or social media campaigns could feature, for instance, a Muslim and a Christian friend jointly discussing how they navigate differences, or a Malay soldier and Chinese soldier recounting overcoming biases during National Service. These personal stories and dialogues, if widely shared, create a *counter-current* to divisive narratives, showing that **coexistence is not only possible but is the lived reality for most Singaporeans**. Additionally, when global conflicts arise (like the Middle East war), the government and community leaders should *proactively guide the discourse*: acknowledge sympathies and concerns, but encourage **constructive outlets** (charity drives for victims rather than angry rallies) and remind citizens not to import foreign hatred into Singapore. By addressing these issues head-on with compassion and clarity, Singapore can prevent foreign conflicts from becoming local divides\u301013\u2020L418-L426\u3011\u301013\u2020L430-L438\u3011.\n\n- **Leverage Technology for Harmony:** Just as hostile actors use tech to spread hate, authorities can use advanced tech to maintain harmony. For example, deploying **AI algorithms to detect hate speech trends** on public forums could provide early warning of budding racial tensions (while respecting privacy via anonymized, pattern-based monitoring). The government could collaborate with local universities or tech firms to develop natural language processing tools that flag dangerous content in local languages/dialects. Additionally, **virtual interfaith dialogues** or VR experiences could be offered to Singaporeans as a novel way to build understanding \u2013 imagine a VR tour of different religious sites with narrations by practitioners, accessible from home. In the next 10 years, creative tech-based engagement might resonate with the digitally native generation, reinforcing harmony in new formats.\n\n### 3. Deepen Education on Multiracialism and Values \n- **Refresh School Curricula for Honest Conversations:** While schools already teach harmony, there is room to update the approach to be more **experiential and discussion-based** for deeper impact. The Ministry of Education could introduce *guided dialogues on race and religion* in secondary schools and junior colleges, where students can, in a safe setting, share personal experiences of culture or even prejudice, moderated by trained teachers. This lets young people **address blind spots and misunderstandings early**. It aligns with the finding that younger Singaporeans *want* more open conversations on these issues, not less\u301018\u2020L1763-L1767\u3011. Curriculum can also include case studies of recent incidents (local or international) to analyze how conflict arises and how it can be resolved or prevented. By examining real scenarios \u2013 e.g. the \u201cbrownface\u201d advertisement saga or a bigoted social media post \u2013 students learn to critically evaluate actions and empathize with those hurt. Moral education should emphasize not just tolerance but **active allyship** \u2013 standing up for friends of another race or faith if they face bullying. If each new cohort emerges more *race-conscious in a positive way* (aware of differences yet respectful and unafraid to challenge racism), the societal norms will further shift towards inclusion.\n\n- **Expand National Integration for Newcomers:** Given continued immigration, it\u2019s important to **educate and socialise new citizens and PRs** into Singapore\u2019s multiracial norms. Currently, new citizens undergo a short orientation and community sharing. This can be expanded into a **mandatory integration program** spanning several weeks, where they attend sessions on local history (including past communal riots), the dos and don\u2019ts of harmonious living (e.g. understanding why one avoids insensitive remarks, how to appreciate other cultures). They could also be required to participate in a community service project alongside longtime locals of various races \u2013 forging relationships through common contribution. The government could partner with ethnic associations and IRCCs to run these programs, providing a grassroots touch. A mentorship scheme could pair each new citizen family with a local \u201cintegration buddy\u201d family of a different ethnicity, meeting up for cultural exchanges. These measures will help **inculcate in immigrants the unique Singapore ethos of multiracial harmony** early on, so they integrate smoothly and are less likely to cluster exclusively with their own compatriates.\n\n- **Promote Interfaith Literacy:** Ignorance is often a breeding ground for mistrust. Singapore should ensure that from students to working adults, there are opportunities to **learn about different religions and cultures beyond surface level**. In schools, beyond festivals, perhaps incorporate visits to various places of worship as part of learning journeys (many schools already do some, but making it routine for all would be beneficial). For the general population, support initiatives like the **Harmony in Diversity Gallery** (an existing interfaith museum) and create **mobile exhibits or online courses** about the basics of each major religion in Singapore \u2013 their beliefs, practices, what they actually say about living with others. Employers could even include inter-cultural competency modules in training for staff, especially those in front-line service (to know, for example, how to respectfully handle customers of different backgrounds). The aim is to shift people from mere tolerance (\u201cI don\u2019t mind your difference\u201d) to **understanding and appreciating** the perspectives of other communities, which builds empathy and reduces chances of offense by ignorance.\n\n- **Family and Community Influence:** Education is not limited to formal settings \u2013 families and community elders must reinforce these values. The government and NGOs can produce **multilingual guides for parents** on teaching children about diversity (e.g. storybooks where characters have different races, tips on answering kids\u2019 questions about racial differences without prejudice). Community centers can host \u201cUnity is Strength\u201d events that bring together families from different cultures for fun activities, subtly encouraging **interracial friendships from an early age**. Religious organizations should also emphasize to congregants the **theology of peace and love** that is common to all faiths \u2013 for instance, churches, temples and mosques in Singapore often exchange greetings during each other\u2019s holy days; this practice can be extended to joint community charity drives where different faith groups work together to help the needy, showing believers that *service and compassion are universal*. Over time, such grassroots educational efforts cultivate a **social milieu where diversity is celebrated** and any divisive messages find little fertile ground.\n\n### 4. Foster Dialogue and Trust-Building in the Community \n- **Institutionalize Ongoing Dialogues:** The next step in our harmony journey may be to institutionalize **safe spaces for tough conversations** on race and religion. The government could set up a **National Harmony Dialogue** platform \u2013 a series of facilitated dialogues across the island, perhaps modeled on the \u201cRegardless of Race\u201d discussions that have taken place, but more regular. These could be townhall-style or small-group discussions where citizens of all backgrounds air concerns, misconceptions, and even grievances in a respectful environment, moderated by trained facilitators from OnePeople.sg or academic experts. Topics might range from everyday microaggressions (\u201cWhy do some people feel upset when\u2026\u201d) to systemic issues (\u201cDoes our meritocracy benefit all races equally?\u201d). The key is to **surface issues before they become conflicts**, and to let people feel heard. Feedback from these dialogues can inform policy fine-tuning. Crucially, this counters the sentiment of those who say talking about race causes tension \u2013 instead, *not* talking about it can breed resentment. By openly addressing issues, Singapore can **strengthen mutual understanding and defuse potential anger** in advance. Surveys show younger Singaporeans, in particular, welcome more of such open dialogue\u301018\u2020L1763-L1767\u3011.\n\n- **Empower Community Champions:** While top-down efforts are important, bottom-up initiatives often resonate more authentically. The government can launch a \u201cHarmony Champions\u201d grant or award scheme to encourage **ground-up projects** that bridge communities. For example, if a youth group wants to organize a multicultural art festival or a neighborhood iftar (breaking of fast) inviting non-Muslims to experience it, they could receive funding and logistical support. Recognizing individuals who have made exceptional efforts in promoting inter-racial harmony (through National Day awards or media features) will also motivate others. These champions could form a network to mentor new projects. By **multiplying the number of players** involved in harmony work, Singapore ensures it\u2019s not just officials or community leaders, but ordinary citizens leading the way in everyday integration.\n\n- **Interfaith and Interethnic Exchanges:** Building on IRCCs and IRO, Singapore can encourage more frequent and informal **exchange programs between different communities**. For instance, organize an \u201cExchange Sundays\u201d program where on a given day, members of different religious congregations visit each other\u2019s services (with explanations provided) \u2013 one month, church members visit a mosque; another month, mosque congregants visit a Hindu temple, etc. Cultural clubs (Chinese clan associations, Indian cultural societies, Malay kampung groups) could pair up to host each other in celebrating festivals together. Even at the individual level, a revived \u201cbuddy system\u201d could pair Singaporeans from different races in a friendship program (something like this was done in schools historically). These exchanges break down the *mystique* of the \u201cother\u201d and often reveal how much common ground there is. Over the next decade, making such interactions routine will lead to **richer bonds and fewer misunderstandings** between communities.\n\n- **Address Sensitive Issues Constructively:** Some topics \u2013 like perceived racial advantages or racial quotas in certain spheres (e.g. university admissions, military ranks) \u2013 are often talked about in hushed tones and can breed discontent. It would be wise for the government and academia to jointly **study and openly address these sensitive issues**. For example, if Malays feel under-represented in certain military roles due to past restrictions, the Ministry of Defence can communicate progress and rationale, possibly easing old policies as trust builds. Or if minorities worry about \u201cChinese privilege,\u201d the government can acknowledge certain majority advantages exist and work to offset them (like ensuring leadership in public service includes minorities, or that public communications don\u2019t assume everyone speaks Mandarin). By pre-emptively tackling these *potential flashpoints* through policy tweaks and clear messaging, Singapore can avoid them becoming polarizing public controversies. In essence, **continuous improvement in fairness** is needed \u2013 demonstrating that the commitment to multiracial meritocracy is real and responsive to valid criticisms.\n\n### 5. Reduce Inequality and Ensure Inclusive Growth \n- **Close Socioeconomic Gaps:** A critical long-term measure for harmony is to ensure **no community disproportionately experiences poverty or unemployment**. The government should deepen analysis of data by race and address any structural causes behind gaps. For instance, if Malay students have lower university attendance, expand mentorship and scholarship programs for them; if a particular racial group has many in a certain low-wage sector, invest in reskilling and career progression for that sector. The self-help groups (CDAC, Mendaki, SINDA, EA) should be continually supported and also encouraged to collaborate on cross-racial programs (recognizing issues like single-parent families or school dropouts happen in all communities). The recent moves to boost preschool access and support lower-income families are steps in the right direction \u2013 these should be monitored for their impact across different ethnic groups. The principle is that **general welfare policies may sometimes need tailored delivery to reach all races equitably**. By  ten years\u2019 time, if educational and income disparities between races are significantly narrowed, one major seed of inter-ethnic tension will have been effectively disarmed.\n\n- **Diverse Representation in Leadership:** \u201cFace representation\u201d matters. Singapore should strive to have diverse faces at decision-making tables \u2013 in politics, civil service leadership, corporate C-suites, and media. Efforts can include leadership development programs targeting talented minorities, diversity pledges by companies, and perhaps gentle nudges (without quota per se) to boards and public sector to reflect the society they serve. When **minority youth see role models in top positions**, it strengthens their sense of belonging and belief in the system\u2019s fairness. The government has made progress (e.g. minority Ministers in key portfolios, more minority President/Parliamentary appointments in recent years), but continued attention here has outsized symbolic importance for unity.\n\n- **Inclusive National Narrative:** As part of strengthening identity, the nation\u2019s storytelling (history, media, museums) should ensure **all communities feel included**. This might mean highlighting contributions of each ethnic group in Singapore\u2019s success, commemorating not just majority heroes but minority heroes as well, and teaching history that includes difficult chapters like racial riots in a way that educates and heals. The upcoming 60th anniversary of independence, for example, could be an opportunity to celebrate multiracial unity \u2013 perhaps by unveiling monuments or community halls named after notable figures from each community who championed harmony. By continuously **refreshing the national narrative to be more inclusive**, Singapore binds its people together under shared pride and reduces the space for divisive narratives to take root.\n\n### 6. Private Sector and Civil Society Partnership \n- **Workplace Harmony Index:** The government could encourage companies to adopt a **Workplace Harmony Index** \u2013 a toolkit to self-audit how inclusive their environment is (covering hiring practices, workplace culture, grievance handling). This could be voluntary at first, possibly evolving into a component of corporate social responsibility reporting. Companies that excel in building multiracial teams and cultures can be recognized (e.g. an annual *Diversity Champion Award* for businesses). The message to the private sector is that harmony is not just a social issue, but an economic advantage \u2013 diverse teams are more innovative and better at serving global markets. Over time, market forces and enlightened self-interest will drive firms to sustain these efforts without constant prodding.\n\n- **Public-Private Campaigns:** Leverage the creativity and reach of the private sector in public campaigns for unity. For instance, local filmmakers or advertising agencies could be commissioned (via contests or grants) to produce short films and viral content on themes of friendship across races, or how Singaporeans come together in crises (like how during COVID, people of all races cheered healthcare workers). These could be far more engaging than government-made PSAs. Similarly, tech companies could collaborate on initiatives like a serious game or app that teaches players about managing diversity (imagine a simulation game where you run a town and have to keep residents of different backgrounds happy \u2013 a playful way to instill the importance of harmony). By partnering with businesses, the effort taps into additional resources and innovation, and signals that **society at large values harmony as much as the government does**.\n\n- **Civil Society Empowerment:** Aside from OnePeople.sg and IRO, many other NGOs can contribute \u2013 for example, advocacy groups that focus on equality, student groups at universities, or even arts collectives that explore social themes. The government should maintain an **open channel with civil society**, providing funding support where appropriate, but also allowing some independence for these groups to experiment and even critique policies constructively. Some of the younger activists might push boundaries (e.g. calling for deeper discussions on race issues), but engaging with them can yield new ideas and keep the movement for harmony dynamic and relevant. For instance, dialogues co-hosted by both government-related organizations and independent community groups can attract a wider audience, including those who might distrust official events. The **breadth of voices** involved in promoting tolerance should be as wide as possible \u2013 from religious clerics to social media influencers to neighborhood youth clubs \u2013 so that every segment of society hears the message in a voice that resonates with them.\n\n- **Regional and International Collaboration:** Finally, Singapore can enhance cooperation with international partners on interfaith and interethnic harmony. This includes sharing best practices with neighboring countries (many of which also face racial/religious tensions) and learning from them. Singapore could host another **International Conference on Cohesive Societies**, like the one in 2019, on a regular basis, bringing global experts and community leaders together to brainstorm solutions to new challenges (be it AI-driven disinformation or post-pandemic xenophobia). By positioning itself as a **global hub for inter-cultural dialogue**, Singapore not only gains insights to use at home but also contributes leadership abroad, which can mitigate some external pressures (for example, working with tech giants and other nations to combat online extremism collaboratively).\n\n## Conclusion \nSingapore\u2019s experience in forging harmony amidst diversity has been held up as a model, but it must **continuously evolve to meet new challenges**. The government\u2019s **proactive stance** \u2013 from **stringent laws against hate** to **social policies for mixing** \u2013 has thus far kept racial and religious tensions largely in check\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011. Most Singaporeans acknowledge and appreciate that effort\u30103\u2020L1613-L1621\u3011\u30103\u2020L1615-L1623\u3011. At the same time, a changing world and a new generation of citizens call for a **refresh of strategies**: a shift towards more **community empowerment, open dialogue, and resilience against global extremist currents**. Potential fault lines \u2013 race, religion, immigration, class, LGBT \u2013 need careful management through inclusive policies and frank engagement, lest they widen into cracks. Global currents, from terror networks to culture wars, will inevitably wash upon Singapore\u2019s shores via media and migration, but with foresight and unity, Singapore can remain a sturdy **ship that weathers the storm** rather than a house divided. \n\nIn preparing for the next decade, the watchwords are **vigilance, inclusiveness, and pragmatism**. Vigilance means never assuming harmony is self-sustaining \u2013 it requires constant work, monitoring, and quick action when threatened\u30105\u2020L1691-L1699\u3011\u30105\u2020L1693-L1701\u3011. Inclusiveness means broadening the circle of those involved in and benefiting from harmony \u2013 every community, every sector should feel they have a stake and a say. Pragmatism means solutions should be grounded in what works in our context \u2013 neither importing foreign models wholesale nor sticking dogmatically to old ways, but tailoring approaches to *what unites our people effectively*. \n\nIf Singapore doubles down on the strengths of its current model (integrated housing, equitable laws, education, interfaith trust) while boldly innovating in new areas (like digital sphere governance, fresh dialogue platforms, and stronger anti-discrimination measures), it will not only **address today\u2019s frictions** but also **future-proof our social cohesion**. In doing so, Singapore can remain, in the words of a community leader, *\u201can outlier\u201d* of harmony \u2013 a society where people of all races and religions continue to live in peace and mutual respect\u301022\u2020L31-L38\u3011\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011, even as storms rage elsewhere. The journey towards an ever more united people is ongoing, but with collective will and wise policy, Singapore can ensure that **regardless of race, language or religion \u2013 we stand together, tomorrow as we do today**. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Singapore Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) & OnePeople.sg surveys and studies on social cohesion\u30105\u2020L1661-L1669\u3011\u301018\u2020L1678-L1686\u3011\u301018\u2020L1703-L1711\u3011  \n- Channel NewsAsia & Straits Times reporting on racial/religious harmony trends and policies\u30103\u2020L1613-L1621\u3011\u30105\u2020L1705-L1713\u3011\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011  \n- Ministry of Home Affairs press releases on the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act and new Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act\u30107\u2020L1-L8\u3011\u30108\u2020L231-L239\u3011\u30108\u2020L253-L262\u3011  \n- RSIS Commentary on rising extremist threats (far-right and Islamist) in Singapore\u301011\u2020L369-L377\u3011\u301013\u2020L454-L463\u3011  \n- \u201cThe Pride\u201d (Singapore Kindness Movement) interviews on managing religious harmony and respecting differences\u301026\u2020L171-L179\u3011\u301026\u2020L239-L247\u3011  \n- Commentary by Mathew Mathews et al. on racial discrimination and progress in Singapore\u301018\u2020L1653-L1661\u3011\u301018\u2020L1703-L1711\u3011  \n- Statements by Singapore leaders on racial harmony trade-offs and approach\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011\u301022\u2020L49-L58\u3011"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":122,"end_ix":138,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"image_inline","asset_pointer_links":[],"clicked_from_url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3268760/singapore-outlier-racial-harmony-approach-being-challenged","clicked_from_title":"Singapore an \u2018outlier\u2019 for racial harmony, but is the approach being challenged?
