There\u2019s an official free online version tied to Harvard\u2019s Stat 110. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search17\ue201  \n- **Ross \u2014 *A First Course in Probability*** (classic, efficient, lots of standard problems; a common \u201cworkhorse\u201d text). \ue200cite\ue202turn4search8\ue201  \n- **DeGroot & Schervish \u2014 *Probability and Statistics*** (nice if you want probability + inference in one coherent book; balanced and readable). \ue200cite\ue202turn4search23\ue201  \n- **Casella & Berger \u2014 *Statistical Inference*** (rigorous, theorem/derivation-forward; excellent if you\u2019re mathematically strong, but not \u201cgentle\u201d). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- **Wasserman \u2014 *All of Statistics*** (compressed \u201cone-volume survey\u201d that reaches into modern topics; great as a fast bridge from theory to practice, but can feel dense if you want lots of hand-holding). \ue200cite\ue202turn2view1\ue201  \n- **Hogg, McKean & Craig \u2014 *Introduction to Mathematical Statistics*** (traditional mathematical statistics sequence; very commonly used). \ue200cite\ue202turn4search22\ue201  \n\n## Year 3 core: regression + linear models\n(\u201cLinear models\u201d covers multiple regression, diagnostics, and **analysis of variance (ANOVA)**-style modeling.)\n- **Kutner, Nachtsheim, Neter & Li \u2014 *Applied Linear Statistical Models*** (broad, practical, very course-friendly). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search12\ue201  \n- **Faraway \u2014 *Linear Models with R*** (clear, modern, applied; notably, there\u2019s a **3rd edition (2025)** if you want the latest). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search13\ue201  \n- **Gelman & Hill \u2014 *Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models*** (excellent for \u201creal research\u201d regression + multilevel modeling; heavier but very rewarding). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search21\ue201  \n\n## Year 3 extension: generalized linear models\n(**Generalized linear models (GLMs)** include logistic regression, Poisson regression, etc.)\n- **Dobson & Barnett \u2014 *An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models*** (best \u201cfirst GLM book\u201d for many students). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search6\ue202turn5search14\ue201  \n- **McCullagh & Nelder \u2014 *Generalized Linear Models*** (the classic reference; powerful but notation-heavy and can be brutal as a first exposure). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search22\ue201  \n\n## Year 3 electives (pick what matches your interests)\n- **Multivariate statistics:** Johnson & Wichern \u2014 *Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis* (standard course text). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search19\ue202turn1search15\ue201  \n- **Time series:** Shumway & Stoffer \u2014 *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications* (canonical; the recent 5th edition adds a lot, and parts can work for advanced undergrads). \ue200cite\ue202turn2view2\ue202turn6search3\ue201  \n- **Bayesian statistics:** Gelman et al. \u2014 *Bayesian Data Analysis* (a serious, widely used text; you\u2019ll meet **Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** properly here). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue202turn5search15\ue201  \n- **Causal inference:** Cunningham \u2014 *Causal Inference: The Mixtape* (excellent applied entry point). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6search16\ue201  \n- **Statistical learning (bridge to machine learning):** James/Witten/Hastie/Tibshirani/Taylor \u2014 *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* (Python edition exists; free PDFs are provided by the authors\u2019 site). \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n  If you want a deeper (more advanced) companion, Hastie/Tibshirani/Friedman \u2014 *The Elements of Statistical Learning* is a standard reference. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search18\ue202turn6search22\ue201  \n\n## A simple \u201cno-regrets\u201d combo\nIf you want a compact but very strong Year 2\u20133 stack:\n1) Blitzstein & Hwang (probability) \u2192 2) Casella & Berger *or* Wasserman (inference) \u2192 3) Faraway (linear models) \u2192 4) Dobson & Barnett (GLMs) \u2192 then specialize (time series / Bayesian / causal / multivariate).\n\nIf you tell me which Year 2/3 topics you\u2019re targeting (e.g., inference-heavy vs modeling-heavy, plus whether you want R or Python), I can narrow this to the best 3\u20135 books for your exact path."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200i\ue202turn7image2\ue202turn7image0\ue202turn7image3\ue202turn7image1\ue201","start_idx":0,"end_idx":51,"safe_urls":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5146zcepzXL._SL1277_.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JNAB2GfgL.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61i%2BeJ%2B8TnL._SL1181_.jpg","https://static-ppimages.freetls.fastly.net/nielsens/9781032593036.jpg?404=default.jpg&canvas=600%2C600&fit=bounds&height=600&mode=max&width=600","https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.Hs28Jb7bOkH2xahF5qVRgQHaKk?pid=Api","https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.HK62RgyTaH6tXy2n0lgyUQHaHa?pid=Api","https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.Gj4p1zZwUYEYjlvXiDg04AHaLO?pid=Api","https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.NLJti_xsuxRLJUc6bSt1AQHaLb?pid=Api","https://www.amazon.com.mx/Time-Analysis-Its-Applications-Examples/dp/3319524518","https://www.amazon.com.mx/Time-Analysis-Its-Applications-Examples/dp/3319524518?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/1441923225","https://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/1441923225?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/3031387465","https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/3031387465?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.paperplus.co.nz/shop/books/non-fiction/mathematics-science/mathematics/statistical-inference-1210313","https://www.paperplus.co.nz/shop/books/non-fiction/mathematics-science/mathematics/statistical-inference-1210313?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":1}],"alt":"[![Statistical
