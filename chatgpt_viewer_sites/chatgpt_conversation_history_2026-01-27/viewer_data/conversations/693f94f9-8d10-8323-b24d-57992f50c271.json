inquiry exposes shocking truth about Aussie uni standards","snippet":"A Senate inquiry into Australian university governance has revealed significant concerns about the declining academic standards across public institutions. The final report, released after a 10-month investigation, criticizes the corporatisation of universities, highlighting issues such as widespread cheating\u2014often facilitated by AI tools\u2014and pressure on academics to inflate grades. Whistleblowers, including academics from top institutions, reported a reduction in the rigor of teaching and assessments, driven by universities\u2019 focus on international student revenue.\n\nThe inquiry found that many universities have moved away from supervised exams, increasing the risk of academic dishonesty. AI misuse was reported as largely undetectable with current assessment methods. The report also criticized the over-reliance on casual teaching staff and warned that low academic and entry standards could endanger Australia\u2019s educational reputation and safety in vocational sectors.\n\nAdditionally, Coalition senators submitted concerns over rising antisemitism on campuses, citing harassment and support for terrorist organizations among student groups. Labor and Greens representatives criticized the corporatisation trend, noting that executive pay scales have grown while staff endure unstable employment and students face higher fees. The committee recommended reviewing university governance laws to prioritize education and research over profit.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1765442220.0,"attribution":"www.theaustralian.com.au"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.unesco.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/guidance-generative-ai-education-and-research","title":"Guidance for generative AI in education and research","snippet":"14 Apr 2025 \u2014 UNESCO's first global guidance on GenAI in education aims to support countries to implement immediate actions, plan long-term policies and develop human ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.unesco.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/what-you-need-know-about-ai-and-right-education","title":"What you need to know about AI and the right to education","snippet":"25 Sept 2025 \u2014 Since 2024, UNESCO has supported 58 countries in designing or improving digital and AI competency frameworks, curricula, and quality-assured ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.unesco.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"oecd.ai","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://oecd.ai/en/incidents/2025-11-09-d8f6","title":"Generative AI Threatens Academic Integrity in Online ...","snippet":"9 Nov 2025 \u2014 Researchers warn that generative AI enables students in asynchronous online courses to complete assignments without genuine engagement, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"oecd.ai"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.nature.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63913-1","title":"Risks of AI scientists: prioritizing safeguarding over autonomy","snippet":"by X Tang \u00b7 2025 \u00b7 Cited by 11 \u2014 AI scientists powered by large language models have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.nature.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-025-00161-3","title":"AI for Science 2025","snippet":"AI for Science 2025.

Positioned as a safeguard against misleading or harmful AI behavior, Scientist AI will function like a \"psychologist\" rather than a user-pleasing \"actor,\" estimating the probability that an AI agent's actions could lead to harm and blocking them if necessary. With $30 million in initial funding and a team of over a dozen researchers, the project is backed by prominent supporters including the Future of Life Institute, Jaan Tallinn, and Schmidt Sciences.\n\nBengio emphasizes the need for AI systems that are humble and probabilistic, not definitive in their responses, and without self-preserving goals. His initiative builds upon open-source AI models and begins with proving the methodology, with the long-term goal of securing large-scale support from governments or labs. Bengio, a Turing Award winner and a key voice in AI safety, expressed concern over recent developments where advanced AI systems have demonstrated deceptive tendencies and resistance to shutdown. He warns that society is entering increasingly perilous territory as AI capabilities advance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1748923222.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/feb/26/uk-universities-warned-to-stress-test-assessments-as-92-of-students-use-ai","title":"UK universities warned to 'stress-test' assessments as 92% of students use AI","snippet":"A new report by the Higher Education Policy Institute and digital textbook provider Kortext reveals a dramatic increase in UK university students' use of generative AI (genAI) tools, such as ChatGPT.

The failure is not due to faulty AI models but stems from poor integration into existing corporate workflows, particularly when generic tools like ChatGPT are used without customization. The study, which is based on 150 interviews, 350 employee surveys, and 300 analyzed AI deployments, highlights that only 5% of such projects succeed\u2014those that focus narrowly on a specific issue and collaborate effectively with AI partners.\n\nMost companies misallocate AI investments, prioritizing sales and marketing, where human interaction still plays a critical role, instead of back-office automation, where AI tends to be more effective. Specialized AI providers yield better results than in-house solutions, yet regulated industries like finance and healthcare lean toward internal development due to privacy and regulatory concerns.\n\nThe report also indicates a subtle workforce shift: while there are few AI-related layoffs now, companies are not replacing administrative and customer support roles vacated by attrition. This trend could be a sign of broader AI-driven job disruption in entry-level white-collar positions over the next five years.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1755682448.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/82d59679-0985-4c07-9416-06a0bec6e16a","title":"Students must learn to be more than mindless 'machine-minders'","snippet":"A recent Higher Education Policy Institute survey revealed a dramatic rise in generative AI use among UK university students, with 92% using AI tools and 88% incorporating them into assessments in 2025 \u2014 up significantly from the previous year. While some educators advocate embracing AI and encouraging students to critically improve AI-generated texts, results have been mixed. Cambridge professor Maria Abreu noted that undergraduates made only superficial edits to AI output, raising concerns that reliance on such tools hampers critical thinking development. Similarly, UCL\u2019s Michael Veale warned that AI could be a \u201cthreat to the learning process,\u201d fostering shortcuts that undermine long-term learning.\n\nResearch into novice programmers and knowledge workers underscores the risks of over-reliance on AI\u2014namely, superficial understanding and an illusion of competence. Lisanne Bainbridge\u2019s 1983 \u201cIronies of Automation\u201d warned of the same erosion of human skill when humans merely monitor machines.

In these advanced economies, up to 60% of jobs could be affected by AI, due to its ability to influence high-skilled roles. Of the exposed jobs, about half may benefit from AI through enhanced productivity, while the other half may see reduced labor demand, lowered wages, and in some cases, job elimination.\n\nIn contrast, emerging and developing economies are expected to face fewer immediate disruptions. Georgieva urged governments to address potential social inequalities caused by AI integration by implementing safety nets and retraining initiatives for vulnerable workers. The IMF joins others, such as Goldman Sachs, which previously reported AI could disrupt over 300 million jobs. Additionally, LinkedIn Vice President Annesh Raman noted the shifting importance from technical to soft skills in the workplace due to AI.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1705290770.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_693f950dd5e4832bbe090de1dc5465c0","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching reports on AI job impact and education","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"c3133d67-7b1e-4e36-828f-1b35ac0b8224","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"857c08b9-35ee-49eb-8e29-e2c7d011bbe5","turn_exchange_id":"1940cfbb-2968-48fc-8242-0c4f2201a260"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"857c08b9-35ee-49eb-8e29-e2c7d011bbe5","children":["703ae3c3-d56e-4f87-8e2f-17a04fb9f2e2"]},"703ae3c3-d56e-4f87-8e2f-17a04fb9f2e2":{"id":"703ae3c3-d56e-4f87-8e2f-17a04fb9f2e2","message":{"id":"703ae3c3-d56e-4f87-8e2f-17a04fb9f2e2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765774634.277811,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Sorting out sources for work, research, and education","content":"I\u2019ve collected enough sources on the impact of AI in the workforce from IMF, ILO, WEF, and NBER.

The Office argues that users accept the AI's interpretation rather than directly authoring the expressive content. For example, even intricate AI-generated art like the controversial image \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre D'op\u00e9ra Spatial\" cannot be copyrighted if no human authorship is evident.\n\nHowever, the report distinguishes between AI as a creative stand-in and AI as an assistive tool. Human-created works that use AI support\u2014like using AI to brainstorm ideas or enhance existing art\u2014may still qualify for copyright, especially when there's recognizable \"perceptible human expression\" involved. Composite works, such as comics or films incorporating AI-generated elements but arranged or modified by a human, can also be protected, though the AI parts themselves are not.\n\nThe Copyright Office also mentions that while prompts are usually treated as unprotectable instructions, especially creative ones might possess some expressive content. Future changes in AI technology might necessitate reevaluation, but current systems don't allow sufficient user control to warrant copyright for AI outputs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1738252280.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_693f950dd5e4832bbe090de1dc5465c0","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for AI tutor studies and author guidelines","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"c3133d67-7b1e-4e36-828f-1b35ac0b8224","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"0ee99a07-d831-4873-90dd-f5db34113d5c","turn_exchange_id":"1940cfbb-2968-48fc-8242-0c4f2201a260"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0ee99a07-d831-4873-90dd-f5db34113d5c","children":["49b4ffb2-6430-4c92-8046-5ee5aa6ac639"]},"49b4ffb2-6430-4c92-8046-5ee5aa6ac639":{"id":"49b4ffb2-6430-4c92-8046-5ee5aa6ac639","message":{"id":"49b4ffb2-6430-4c92-8046-5ee5aa6ac639","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765774643.316361,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Planning the answer on AGI\u2019s impact across sectors","content":"For the question about how AGI will shape education, research, and jobs, I\u2019ll begin by defining AGI as systems performing most tasks at human capacity with autonomy and tool use.

*Social, Ethical and Legal Aspects of Generative AI*, contains numerous fake or unverifiable citations. The book, marketed as a comprehensive guide on AI ethics, reportedly includes references to non-existent journals and fabricated academic sources\u2014suggesting parts may have been generated by AI tools known to produce false citations. One chapter alone had 8 out of 11 citations that could not be verified.\n\nExperts like Guillaume Cabanac from the University of Toulouse used tools like BibCheck to identify that a significant number of the book\u2019s references were either fabricated or erroneous. A separate review by Dr. Nathan Camp confirmed similar findings, including mismatched or composite citations possibly generated by AI. This discovery adds to growing concerns about AI\u2019s impact on academic integrity, with Springer Nature having recently retracted another book for similar citation issues.

The study suggests AI fosters an \u201cillusion of expertise,\u201d especially in creative and knowledge-heavy roles, where workers may skip the critical thinking processes essential for true understanding and long-term skill development. This problem is particularly acute for early-career professionals, who risk missing foundational learning experiences by over-relying on AI. \n\nThe report warns that AI use can lead to either a \u201ccognitive dividend\u201d or \u201ccognitive debt,\u201d depending on whether it complements existing expertise or replaces the skill-building process. Additionally, workplace incentives \u2014 like measuring performance by AI tool usage \u2014 can worsen the problem. Leaders are advised to align AI adoption with meaningful business goals, such as quality and innovation, rather than usage frequency. The recommended approach is deliberate AI use that supports learning and expertise rather than substituting it.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1765372717.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/hr-big-challenge-get-workers-trust-adopt-ai-2025-12","title":"Getting workers to trust and adopt AI is 'forcing HR people to reinvent themselves'","snippet":"As corporate investment in AI soared to $252.3 billion in 2024, companies face a critical challenge: getting workers to trust and adopt the technology. Despite the massive spending, widespread employee skepticism persists, with concerns about job loss and trust in AI systems, according to surveys by Pew and the University of Melbourne. This is prompting a major transformation in human resources (HR), which is now under pressure to lead AI integration within organizations.\n\nExperts like Ted F. Tschang and Heather Conklin emphasize the need for HR leaders to foster AI fluency and create space for safe experimentation. Credibility is key\u2014HR departments must engage with AI tools firsthand before championing them to others. By solving real worker problems\u2014like reducing paperwork and automating tedious tasks\u2014AI can become a trusted aid rather than a threat.\n\nAdditionally, outdated HR systems exacerbate these issues, with learning platforms and performance reviews ill-suited to modern organizational needs. Yet, overcoming job security fears and concerns over algorithmic bias remains crucial. If HR fails to guide this transition, it risks becoming obsolete in the AI-driven workplace.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1765462098.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mckinsey.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai","title":"The State of AI: Global Survey 2025","snippet":"5 Nov 2025 \u2014 Our latest survey shows a larger share of respondents reporting AI use by their organizations, though most have yet to scale the technologies.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1762300800.0,"attribution":"www.mckinsey.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-how-organizations-are-rewiring-to-capture-value","title":"The State of AI: Global survey","snippet":"12 Mar 2025 \u2014 The latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI finds that organizations are beginning to take steps that drive bottom-line impact\u2014for example, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.mckinsey.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/quantumblack/our%20insights/the%20state%20of%20ai/2025/the-state-of-ai-how-organizations-are-rewiring-to-capture-value_final.pdf?ref=filipeoliveira.pt","title":"The state of AI","snippet":"5 Mar 2025 \u2014 Organizations are beginning to create the structures and processes that lead to meaningful value from gen AI.
