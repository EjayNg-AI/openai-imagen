says US will sell F-35 stealth jets to Saudis as Prince Mohammed visits","snippet":"During a red-carpet visit by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, former President Donald Trump announced plans to sell advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets to the Gulf state. This marks the first potential F-35 sale to a Middle Eastern country beyond Israel, which traditionally receives exclusive access to U.S. military technologies to maintain regional superiority. The meeting signifies a significant move in restoring U.S.-Saudi relations after the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the CIA linked to the crown prince. Trump, emphasizing Saudi Arabia\u2019s value as an ally, is expected to finalize several billion-dollar deals, including Saudi investments in U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite lingering concerns, including from Khashoggi\u2019s widow and pro-Israel lawmakers over regional arms balance, the rapprochement reflects shifting Middle Eastern geopolitics, particularly the shared vigilance toward Iran. The visit concludes with a White House dinner hosted by Melania Trump.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1763468209.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.devdiscourse.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/Newsalert/3702505-trump-designates-saudi-arabia-as-major-non-nato-ally-as-us-administration-aims-to-elevate-military-relationship-reports-ap","title":"Trump designates Saudi Arabia as major non-NATO ally as US administration aims to elevate military relationship, reports AP.","snippet":"Read more about Trump designates Saudi Arabia as major non-NATO ally as US administration aims to elevate military relationship,...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":13},"pub_date":1763514787.736538,"attribution":"www.devdiscourse.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/18/trump-saudi-epstein-ice-gaza/fb20ab0a-c481-11f0-be23-3ccb704f61ac_story.html","title":"The Latest: Trump to decide on Epstein files release after Senate agrees to pass the legislation","snippet":"Both the House and Senate have acted decisively to pass a bill forcing the Justice Department to release its files on the convicted sex...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":16},"pub_date":1763515747.73926,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/18/saudi-prince-trump-visit-white-house/","title":"Trump defends Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi killing","snippet":"On November 18, 2025, President Donald Trump publicly defended Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the prince\u2019s visit to Washington, D.C., despite a U.S. intelligence report holding the prince responsible for the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump dismissed the accusations, stating \u201cthings happen,\u201d and portrayed Mohammed as a respected leader. The crown prince received a lavish welcome at the White House, complete with military honors and a flyover of fighter jets.\n\nIn the Oval Office, Trump criticized reporter Mary Bruce for raising the Khashoggi matter, labeling it an inappropriate question. The visit underscores Trump\u2019s close relationship with Mohammed\u2014including discussions on increased Saudi investment in the U.S., potential arms deals (notably F-35 sales), and talks around Israeli normalization, though Saudi officials still insist on a clear path to a Palestinian state.\n\nThe visit sparked backlash from human rights advocates, The Washington Post staff, and Khashoggi\u2019s widow, who called it shameful to avoid addressing the murder. Despite past international condemnation, Saudi-U.S. relations appear stronger than ever, with plans for further defense cooperation, AI partnerships, and increased Saudi investments nearing $1 trillion.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1763460042.602,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"fortune.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/05/15/saudi-arabia-600-billion-oil-trump/","title":"Saudi Arabia's $600 billion promise to the U.S. needs oil prices to stay high\u2014which will likely anger Trump","snippet":"The administration has touted an investment from Saudi Arabia described as totaling $600 billion or, in one case, $1 trillion.

The commitment reflects a significant and long-term investment in traditional military hardware, despite ongoing debates about the relevance of tanks in modern warfare.\n\nThe deal was revealed as part of multiple U.S.-Saudi agreements unveiled by the Trump administration following consultations with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Abrams tanks, manufactured by General Dynamics Land Systems, are already in use by the U.S. Army and other nations, including Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman informed President Trump earlier that Saudi Arabia plans to boost its U.S. investments to $1 trillion, up from the current $600 billion, emphasizing deepening economic and defense ties.

Inside the Oval Office, the leaders displayed camaraderie, with Trump joking about past interactions and expressing confidence in the U.S. economy\u2019s appeal to foreign investors.\n\nThe investment deal will see Saudi Arabia increase its U.S. holdings from $600 billion to nearly $1 trillion, with a focus on sectors like artificial intelligence and rare earth materials. Trump emphasized the potential job creation and economic growth spurred by the investment, framing it as a testament to his administration's economic leadership. The meeting also hinted at potential defense deals, such as the sale of F-35 stealth jets, and deeper regional cooperation, especially regarding Middle East security and Gaza.

Designation as Major Non-NATO Ally  \n### What happened  \n- On **18 November 2025**, US President \ue200entity\ue202[\"people\",\"Donald J. Trump\",0]\ue201 announced that Saudi Arabia would be designated as a \u201cmajor non-NATO ally\u201d (MNNA). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search31\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search21\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- The announcement took place during a high-profile visit of Saudi Crown Prince \ue200entity\ue202[\"people\",\"Mohammed bin Salman\",0]\ue201 (often \u201cMBS\u201d) to Washington. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news4\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- The official White House fact sheet mentions that this move is part of \u201cdeepening the strategic partnership,\u201d expanding job creation, strengthening supply chains and regional stability. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\n### Why it's significant  \n- The MNNA status gives the US and Saudi Arabia closer cooperation possibilities: greater access to US defence equipment, shared logistics, training, and interoperability\u2014short of being a NATO member.  \n- It signals a shift in US-Saudi relations, elevating the military and security dimension of their bilateral relationship.  \n- For Saudi Arabia, it underscores its desire to be seen not just as a regional player but as a strategic partner to the US with deeper global linkages.\n\n### Key details / unanswered questions  \n- It was described as a \u201csecret\u201d decision until the announcement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search31\ue201  \n- The fact sheet does *not* lay out all operational details of how the new status will be implemented (for example, which US systems will be shared, or exact timelines). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- Political and human-rights concerns remain \u2014 especially regarding Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in regional conflicts and the 2018 murder of journalist \ue200entity\ue202[\"people\",\"Jamal Khashoggi\",0]\ue201, which continues to be a contentious issue. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news39\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Saudi Investment Commitments in the US  \n### What the numbers say  \n- Earlier in May 2025, Saudi Arabia committed **US\\$600 billion** in investments in the US. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search33\ue202turn0news17\ue202turn0news30\ue201  \n- On 18 November 2025, during the Washington visit, the Crown Prince announced the intent to **raise** that commitment from US\\$600 billion to **\u201calmost US\\$1 trillion\u201d**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0news38\ue202turn0news1\ue201  \n- The White House fact sheet repeats that \u201cthe Crown Prince announced today that Saudi Arabia will be increasing their investment commitments in the United States to almost US\\$1 trillion.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- The sectors explicitly mentioned for deepening cooperation include civil nuclear energy, defence, artificial intelligence (AI) and supply-chain resilience. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news35\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\n### What this implies  \n- The jump from US\\$600 billion to near US\\$1 trillion suggests a major scaling up of Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic engagement with the US.  \n- This kind of capital commitment (if realised) could have large implications for US industry\u2014particularly in advanced technology, infrastructure, energy and defence supply chains.  \n- For Saudi Arabia, it represents a strategic repositioning: investing heavily abroad (especially in the US) is part of its broader economic transformation agenda (e.g., via its sovereign wealth fund or other investment vehicles).\n\n### Caveats & things to watch  \n- **Commitment vs. execution**: A pledge of nearly US\\$1 trillion is substantial, but past experience suggests large announced numbers may not fully materialise (or may do so over long time-frames). For example: the earlier US\\$600 billion figure had been referenced before. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue202turn0search33\ue201  \n- **Timescale unclear**: The announcements do *not* clearly specify over what period (e.g., 5 years, 10 years) this near-US\\$1 trillion investment will occur.  \n- **Sector and legal risk**: Issues including regulatory approval, geopolitical risk, human-rights pressure, and energy-market volatility could all influence realisation.  \n- **Oil price dependency**: One article notes that Saudi\u2019s ability to invest at these levels depends significantly on oil prices remaining high \u2014 introducing macro risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Strategic Context & Forward-Looking Considerations  \n- This move comes at a time when the US is recalibrating its Middle-East strategic posture, and Saudi Arabia is seeking to diversify its economy (e.g., via its \ue200entity\ue202[\"policy\", \"Vision 2030\", 0]\ue201 programme).  \n- The alignment of investments in AI, civil nuclear cooperation, and defence suggests both nations see shared opportunities: Saudi Arabia to modernise and diversify; the US to secure strategic partnerships and industrial/technological advantages.  \n- For you, as someone with interest in coding, AI and machine-learning: the emphasis on AI investment means potential large-scale infrastructure and partnership opportunities (in US companies, cross-border collaboration, or tech-ecosystem initiatives) may emerge.  \n- From a research/analytical perspective: we should watch for **implementation details** \u2014 e.g., which US entities get Saudi investment, what regulatory frameworks are applied, how the MNNA status affects arms sales and tech-transfer, and how human-rights discourse (including Khashoggi) is managed in trade/defence oversight.  \n- Risk matrix:  \n  - **Execution risk**: High. Pledges are big, but conversion to actual projects takes time.  \n  - **Reputational/human-rights risk**: Medium-high. US Congress and civil\u2010society may push back.  \n  - **Oil-market/financial risk**: Medium. Saudi\u2019s ability to invest depends partly on hydrocarbon revenues and sovereign fund performance.  \n  - **Geopolitical/arms-offset risk**: Medium. Elevating military ties can trigger regional reactions (Iran, Israel, Gulf states) and complicate US commitments.  \n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can pull together a short **timeline chart** of past US-Saudi investment pledges (e.g., from 2017 onward) and a **ranked list of announced sectors** where Saudi investment in the US is likely to focus (with companies/industries). Would you like me to do that?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200navlist\ue202Latest US\u2011Saudi alliance &

Trump dismissed the accusations, stating \u201cthings happen,\u201d and portrayed Mohammed as a respected leader. The crown prince received a lavish welcome at the White House, complete with military honors and a flyover of fighter jets.\n\nIn the Oval Office, Trump criticized reporter Mary Bruce for raising the Khashoggi matter, labeling it an inappropriate question. The visit underscores Trump\u2019s close relationship with Mohammed\u2014including discussions on increased Saudi investment in the U.S., potential arms deals (notably F-35 sales), and talks around Israeli normalization, though Saudi officials still insist on a clear path to a Palestinian state.\n\nThe visit sparked backlash from human rights advocates, The Washington Post staff, and Khashoggi\u2019s widow, who called it shameful to avoid addressing the murder. Despite past international condemnation, Saudi-U.S. relations appear stronger than ever, with plans for further defense cooperation, AI partnerships, and increased Saudi investments nearing $1 trillion.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Washington Post"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search33\ue202turn0news17\ue202turn0news30\ue201","start_idx":2468,"end_idx":2512,"safe_urls":["https://fortune.com/2025/05/15/saudi-arabia-600-billion-oil-trump/","https://fortune.com/2025/05/15/saudi-arabia-600-billion-oil-trump/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.newsweek.com/trump-600b-saudi-arabia-investment-deal-2072228","https://www.newsweek.com/trump-600b-saudi-arabia-investment-deal-2072228?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-600-billion-investment-commitment-in-saudi-arabia/","https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-600-billion-investment-commitment-in-saudi-arabia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-600-billion-investment-commitment-in-saudi-arabia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Fact Sheet: President Donald J.

Trump emphasized the potential job creation and economic growth spurred by the investment, framing it as a testament to his administration's economic leadership. The meeting also hinted at potential defense deals, such as the sale of F-35 stealth jets, and deeper regional cooperation, especially regarding Middle East security and Gaza. Trump dismissed concerns about a conflict of interest stemming from his family's Saudi business dealings, asserting his full focus on national leadership.","attribution":"New York Post"},{"title":"Saudi Crown Prince bin Salman hikes committed US investment to nearly $1T","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/saudi-crown-prince-bin-salman-hikes-committed-us-investment-nearly-1t?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman committed to investing $1 trillion into the U.S. economy during an Oval Office meeting with President...","attribution":"Fox News"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":12},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The White House"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201","start_idx":2949,"end_idx":2968,"safe_urls":["https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-solidifies-economic-and-defense-partnership-with-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/","https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-solidifies-economic-and-defense-partnership-with-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-solidifies-economic-and-defense-partnership-with-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Fact Sheet: President Donald J.
