Motivated either by visions of economic growth or lucrative control over the means of production, tech leaders such as Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Geoffrey Hinton have voiced support for the possibility\u2014or inevitability\u2014of widespread job automation. Venture capitalists and influential industry figures are investing heavily in companies like Mechanize, which openly aims to completely automate the economy. AI capabilities have already disrupted sectors like freelance writing and graphic design, with advanced models outperforming top professionals. Robots are also evolving quickly, managing complex physical tasks and being tested for home use. While some high-profile careers remain resistant to automation, most jobs face potential replacement as artificial general intelligence (AGI) becomes increasingly viable in the near future. This development raises ethical and socioeconomic concerns about labor displacement and wealth distribution, as Silicon Valley races to capitalize on the transformation. The piece questions not just the feasibility of a post-labor world, but the underlying motives and its implications for society at large.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1747033245.0,"attribution":"The Guardian"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mckinsey.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages","title":"Jobs of the future: Jobs lost, jobs gained - McKinsey & Company","snippet":"The United States and Germany could also face significant workforce displacement from automation by 2030, but their projected future growth\u2014and ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1511827200.0,"attribution":"McKinsey & Company"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america","title":"Generative AI and the future of work in America | McKinsey","snippet":"By 2030, activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated\u2014a trend accelerated by ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1690329600.0,"attribution":"McKinsey & Company"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/ai-automation-and-the-future-of-work-ten-things-to-solve-for","title":"AI, automation, and the future of work: Ten things to solve for","snippet":"Jobs lost: Some occupations will see significant declines by 2030.

Over 190 companies in the UK now offer a four-day working week with full pay. This movement began with an extensive trial by 4 Day Week Global, where 61 companies across various sectors reduced working hours for six months starting in June 2022. Results showed declines in stress and illness among roughly 2,900 participating employees, alongside a slight revenue increase of 1.4% during the trial and a substantial 35% increase compared to the same period in 2021. However, some employees reported increased workloads and less sociable work environments, particularly in creative sectors. Still, reduced sickness absences, lower staff turnover, and better recruitment drove the appeal for many employers. Soon, workers' rights changes may further support the four-day week through the UK Employment Rights Bill, which focuses on making flexible working the default from the first day of employment.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1735464564.0,"attribution":"The Scottish Sun"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_682568252bd880078f0de96a5dc9cce8","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"5eb0ed9b-9fa4-4b7c-9052-6342203ee6c9","request_id":"93ffc2310fc5fdcb-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5eb0ed9b-9fa4-4b7c-9052-6342203ee6c9","children":["5ad27c83-2ca7-49c9-abda-5f23756adf99"]},"5ad27c83-2ca7-49c9-abda-5f23756adf99":{"id":"5ad27c83-2ca7-49c9-abda-5f23756adf99","message":{"id":"5ad27c83-2ca7-49c9-abda-5f23756adf99","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1747281980.787618,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering credible sources on AI and job displacement","content":"I will check McKinsey's 2023 report, Goldman Sachs\u2019 2023 analysis, and the IMF blog for insights on AI-driven job displacement.

Below is a realist view\u2014no wishful thinking, no apocalypse hype\u2014of how the economy is most likely to adjust and what governments will be pushed to do.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Economic Mechanics of a 20 % Shock  \n\n| Channel | Direction of Pressure | Why it matters |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **Productivity** | **\u2191 1.5\u20132 pp/yr** in adopting sectors | Generative AI shrinks white-collar task time by ~30 % \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201; robot density keeps rising 10 % y-o-y \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201. |\n| **Labour income share** | **\u2193** | Firms capture the bulk of the productivity dividend before wages adjust. |\n| **Aggregate demand** | **Mixed** | Higher profits and capital gains offset weaker wage growth for a while, but lower-income households have higher MPCs, so consumption growth slows after 2-3 years. |\n| **Prices** | **Disinflationary bias** in routine-service basket; **inflationary pressure** in skilled-labour bottlenecks (AI engineers, electricians, nurses). |\n| **Inequality** | **\u2191 sharply** | IMF expects the complement/replace split inside advanced-economy jobs to be roughly 50-50, widening the wage spread \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Sector-Level Winners and Casualties  \n\n| Growing demand (2025-32) | Stagnant/declining demand |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Health & elder care (+3.5 m US jobs) \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201 | Office support, basic bookkeeping, routine customer service (-10 m US jobs) \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201 |\n| Construction & infrastructure (public-investment-driven) \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201 | Food-service counter roles, warehouse pick-pack |\n| Clean-energy technicians, electricians | Some middle-management layers (report-writing, compliance) |\n| AI engineering, data operations, cyber-security | Low-margin creative piecework (basic design, copywriting) |\n\nRoutine production and low-wage service work account for **~80 % of the net losses**; high-skilled work is *reshaped* more than eliminated.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Macro Trajectory\u2014Most Likely Path  \n\n| Phase | Years | Narrative |\n|-------|-------|-----------|\n| **Acceleration** | 2025-27 | Tight labour markets hide displacement; profits and investment boom, GDP growth +0.7 pp/yr above trend \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201. |\n| **Frictions** | 2028-29 | Occupational mismatch shows: unemployment edges up 1-2 pp even as vacancy rates stay high; wage-price dispersion widens. |\n| **Adjustment** | 2030-32 | Productivity gains partly feed into real wages for skilled cohorts but median real wage growth stalls; consumption slows; fiscal strains emerge as payroll tax base erodes. |\n\nIf policy is *inactive*, the demand shortfall in the bottom 60 % of households plus higher profit concentration risks a **deflationary drift and political backlash** reminiscent of the 1890s and 1930s tech shocks.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Policy Responses That Will **Actually Happen** (Rank-ordered by political likelihood)\n\n| Rank | Instrument (2025-32) | Political logic | Evidence / status |\n|------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **1** | **Scaled-up active labour-market spending** (reskilling vouchers, wage-insurance topping up 50-70 % of lost pay for 1-3 yrs) | Centrists prefer \u201cwork-first\u201d optics | Already in US CHIPS & Science Act training lines; EU \u201cJust Transition Fund\u201d |\n| **2** | **Tax credits/subsidies for *human* hiring & training** | Easiest to legislate, frames AI as complement | Korea\u2019s automation tax *credits* show how incentives can be steered \ue200cite\ue202turn5search4\ue201 |\n| **3** | **Shorter work-week mandates / negotiated four-day week** | Shares work without headline layoffs; backed by early trial data showing productivity holds \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201 |\n| **4** | **Enhanced Earned-Income-Tax-Credit / negative-income-tax** | Targets the bottom two quintiles, far cheaper than UBI | Cost < 1 % GDP in US-size economies vs \u2265 6 % GDP for full UBI |\n| **5** | **Sectoral job-guarantee pilots (care, climate resilience)** | Absorbs long-term unemployed; shored up by Green New Deal style politics | Local-government schemes in US/EU already piloted |\n| **6** | **Modest \u201crobot-use levy\u201d or accelerated cap-depreciation claw-back** | Populist appeal but economists see limited revenue; MIT study shows optimal rate 1-4 % \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201 |\n| **7** | **Broad-based Universal Basic Income** | Remains fiscal- and coalition-heavy; probable only in small affluent states (e.g., Norway, Singapore dividend-style payouts) |\n\n*Why UBI is unlikely by 2032:* Even a stripped-down USD 12 k/year UBI for all US adults costs \u2248 6.6 % GDP\u2014politically unpalatable when ageing already lifts health- and pension-spending to record levels.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Political-Economy Stress Points  \n\n* **Urban-tech hubs vs. de-industrial towns:** income divergence intensifies, feeding populist parties and \u201ctech-lash\u201d demands to slow AI deployment.  \n* **Union resurgence in logistics, education and care:** as seen in 2024\u201325 port and delivery strikes resisting automation \ue200cite\ue202turn4news10\ue201.  \n* **Migration realignment:** high-skill visas loosen (to get AI talent), low-skill inflows tighten, risking geopolitical tension with labour-exporting countries.  \n* **Fiscal competition:** corporate tax bases shift toward intangible capital; jurisdictions race for AI data centres (already adding 30 % to EU power demand forecasts \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201).\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Alternative Scenarios (probability-weighted)\n\n| Scenario | Probability | Key markers | Outcome by 2032 |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Managed Transition** | 50 % | Governments fund retraining, firms adopt four-day week, targeted transfers cushion demand | Unemployment +1 pp vs 2024, inequality still rises but social unrest contained. |\n| **Disorderly Shock** | 30 % | Policy gridlock; payroll base erodes faster than safety-net expansion; consumer demand slumps | Recession in 2029-30, surge of anti-tech parties, moratoria on some AI uses. |\n| **Productivity Boom** | 20 % | Rapid complementary adoption; new services (AI-personalised health, climate tech) create more jobs than lost | Real median wages keep pace with productivity; deficit stable via growth dividend. |\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Take-Aways for a Skeptical Observer  \n\n1. **Automation at 20 % displacement is economically survivable**\u2014but only with *active* redistribution of the gains from capital to labour.  \n2. **UBI remains a fringe fix**; expect layered solutions: bigger wage subsidies, shorter weeks, and public job guarantees instead.  \n3. **Inequality, not mass unemployment, is the central macro risk.** Left unchecked it drags on consumption and feeds instability faster than the historical record because the pace of displacement is compressed into one business cycle.  \n4. **Policies will lag the technology**\u2014so a two-year window (2025-27) is critical for governments to scale training funds and pilot new social-insurance architecture before the \u201cfriction\u201d phase hits.  \n\nBleak? Possibly. Catastrophic? Unlikely\u2014provided policymakers move now rather than when 10 million angry, newly redundant workers show up at the ballot box."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":270,"end_idx":287,"safe_urls":["https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america"],"refs":[],"alt":"([McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Generative AI and the future of work in America | McKinsey","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"McKinsey & Company"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201","start_idx":305,"end_idx":323,"safe_urls":["https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity"],"refs":[],"alt":"([IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI Will Transform the Global Economy.
