I group the books by the *kind* of space on which integration is carried out, because the conceptual pivots (\u03c3-algebras \u2192 Radon measures \u2192 differential forms \u2192 invariant measures, etc.) change slightly in each realm.  Prerequisites, typical use-cases, and the mathematical \u201cflavour\u201d are flagged so you can decide where to invest time.\n\n---\n\n### 1  Foundational Abstract Measure Theory  \n*Why start here?*  All subsequent generalisations assume you can navigate complete measure spaces, product measures, Radon\u2013Nikodym, and modes of convergence almost reflexively.\n\n| Scope | Recommended Text | Distinctive Strengths | Comments |\n|-------|------------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| encyclopaedic, functional-analytic | **Zigang Pan \u2013 *Measure-Theoretic Calculus in Abstract Spaces* (Birkh\u00e4user, 2023)** | 950-page \u201cgrand tour\u201d; builds Lebesgue, Daniell, Radon measures on completely general topological and even infinite-dimensional Banach spaces; ends with Sobolev spaces and optimisation theory. | Essentially a one-stop graduate reference when proofs in more specialised monographs cite \u201cstandard measure-theoretic facts\u201d. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201 |\n| concise, graduate-friendly | **Tao \u2013 *An Introduction to Measure Theory* (latest update Aug 2025, open access)** | Free, well-polished lecture-note style that emphasises intuition, counter-examples, and links to ergodic theory. | For a fast refresher before heading into Haar or manifold integration.  \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue201 |\n\n*(Halmos\u2019* Measure Theory*, Cohn\u2019s* Measure Theory*, and Bogachev\u2019s two-volume treatise remain indispensable classics; I assume you already know or own one of them.)*\n\n---\n\n### 2  Locally-Compact Groups and Haar Measure  \n*Key idea:*  replace translation-invariant Lebesgue measure on \u211d\u207f by a (left- or right-) invariant Radon measure on any locally compact group G; harmonic analysis rides on this foundation.\n\n| Text | What it does especially well | Why it matters now |\n|------|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Rohit Manglik \u2013 *Topological Groups and Measure Theory* (EduGorilla, 2024)** | Streamlined, 160-page entry point focused on constructing Haar measure, proving uniqueness, then developing Pontryagin duality for compact abelian groups. | Very recent, light-weight alternative to the dense Hewitt\u2013Ross or Folland treatments\u2014ideal if you want \u201cjust enough\u201d Haar measure before moving to applications in representation theory or machine learning on groups. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201 |\n| **Folland \u2013 *A Course in Abstract Harmonic Analysis* (2e 2016)** | Still the gold standard for non-abelian harmonic analysis, Plancherel theorem, and representation-theoretic applications. | Pair with Manglik for depth once comfortable. |\n\n---\n\n### 3  Integration on Manifolds  \n*Motivation:*  push Lebesgue integration through the machinery of differential forms so that integrals are coordinate-free and compatible with Stokes\u2019 theorem.\n\n| Text | Focus | Comments |\n|------|-------|----------|\n| **Spivak \u2013 *Calculus on Manifolds*** and **Lee \u2013 *Introduction to Smooth Manifolds* (3e 2024)** | Builds integration of top-degree forms; Lee supplements with modern proofs of de Rham and Stokes, partitions of unity, orientation issues. | Lee\u2019s latest edition fixes many errata and adds short sections on currents and measure-theoretic pitfalls. |\n| **MIT OCW Lecture 34 notes, \u201cIntegration on Manifolds\u201d (Spring 2024)** | Crisp six-page derivation of manifold integration using partitions of unity; a quick sanity check against your own derivations. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n### 4  Geometric Measure Theory & Fine Properties of Functions  \n*Why you\u2019ll care:*  rectifiability, BV/Sobolev spaces on manifolds, minimal surfaces, and analysis on fractals all sit here.\n\n| Text | Edition notes | Highlights |\n|------|--------------|------------|\n| **Evans & Gariepy \u2013 *Measure Theory and Fine Properties of Functions* (3e 2025)** | Newly expanded chapter on fractional Sobolev spaces; streamlined proofs of Besicovitch covering, Rademacher, coarea. | Ideal segue into analysis on metric spaces and PDE regularity theory. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201 |\n| **Mattila \u2013 *Geometry of Sets and Measures in Euclidean Spaces* (2e 2021)** | Classic for rectifiable sets, 1-parameter groups of dilations, and connections to harmonic analysis (Marstrand, Kakeya). | Complements Evans\u2013Gariepy by being more geometric. |\n\n---\n\n### 5  Special-Purpose or Forward-Looking Monographs  \nThese drill into niches that are becoming mainstream in analysis, probability, and data science.\n\n| Theme | Book | Why it\u2019s worth skimming now |\n|-------|------|----------------------------|\n| Infinite-dimensional analysis & optimisation | **Pan \u2013 *Measure-Theoretic Calculus \u2026*** (see \u00a71) | Sections 9-13 treat differentiation/integration in Banach spaces and Hilbert-valued measures\u2014useful for stochastic PDEs. |\n| Probability foundations | **Goswami & Rao \u2013 *Measure Theory for Analysis and Probability* (2025)** | Builds \u03c3-finite measure theory directly toward Brownian motion and martingales; cleaner than the older Billingsley route. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201 |\n| Non-commutative geometry | **Connes \u2013 *Noncommutative Geometry* (reprinted 2024)** | Introduces weights and traces as \u201cmeasures\u201d on operator algebras; if you foresee work at the physics or quantum-information interface. |\n| Categorical perspectives | **Kock \u2013 *Convenient Categories of Spaces for Measure Theory* (pre-print 2024)** | Sketches measure and integration in cartesian closed categories\u2014still research-level but aligns with your interest in category theory. |\n\n---\n\n### 6  Strategic Reading Path  \n1. **Refresh** abstract measure theory quickly with Tao (or Axler) to ensure \u03b5\u2013\u03b4 comfort across \u03c3-algebras and product measures.  \n2. **Choose a branch point**:  \n   * If harmonic analysis/topological groups interest you, read Manglik \u2192 Folland, doing exercises on modular functions and convolution.  \n   * If geometry and PDEs beckon, take Spivak/Lee \u2192 Evans\u2013Gariepy/Mattila, paying attention to rectifiability and BV theory.  \n3. **Layer in functional-analytic depth** with Pan\u2019s monograph as needed when infinite-dimensional issues arise (e.g., Gaussian measures on Banach spaces).  \n4. **Sample cutting-edge material** (BookAuthority list) once the core is internalised; these texts assume you can already manipulate Radon\u2013Nikodym and Hausdorff measures effortlessly.\n\n---\n\n### 7  Emerging Trends to Watch  \n*   **Integration on singular spaces** (e.g., stratified manifolds, metric measure spaces with Ricci curvature bounds) is moving fast; look for forthcoming texts by Gigli and Ambrosio.  \n*   **Data-driven harmonic analysis** on non-abelian groups (graph neural networks on Lie groups) increasingly cites Haar-measure results\u2014another reason to master that material.  \n*   **Category-theoretic measure theory** may unify probability and integration in machine-learning pipelines; early drafts (e.g., Kock) are promising but still experimental.\n\n---\n\n### Concluding Perspective  \nMeasure and integration theory have diversified far beyond \u211d\u207f.  The books above are chosen for clarity, rigour, and\u2014crucially\u2014*forward compatibility* with modern analysis and AI-adjacent mathematics.  Given your background in category theory and machine learning, alternating between Haar-measure harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory will place you at the frontier where abstract analysis meets data-driven applications.\n\nHappy reading\u2014and whenever you grapple with a theorem proof or need a bridge between these realms, feel free to drill deeper together."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201","start_idx":1384,"end_idx":1401,"safe_urls":["https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-21912-2"],"refs":[],"alt":"([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-21912-2))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Measure-Theoretic Calculus in Abstract Spaces: On the Playground of Infinite-Dimensional Spaces | SpringerLink","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-21912-2","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"SpringerLink"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue201","start_idx":1708,"end_idx":1728,"safe_urls":["https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/an-introduction-to-measure-theory/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/an-introduction-to-measure-theory/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"An introduction to measure theory -
