Stein noted ongoing concerns around power and funding for AI infrastructure but emphasized that AI semiconductor stocks remain attractively priced relative to their growth potential. He also slightly reduced his price target for AMD to $277, though AMD rose 6.2% to $213.43 on the day.\n\nSimilarly, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also argued that Nvidia stock is historically cheap relative to the SOX (Philadelphia Semiconductor Index), noting only 13 days in the past decade with cheaper valuations. He attributed Nvidia\u2019s recent underperformance to investor caution around AI stocks. Rasgon rated Nvidia \u201coutperform\u201d with a $275 price target.

Other Chinese firms such as Moore Threads and Cambricon Technologies are also expanding, although their technology still trails Nvidia\u2019s.\n\nIn the U.S., Amazon is emerging as a strong competitor through its in-house Trainium AI processors, which OpenAI is reportedly considering using under a potential $10 billion deal. Google, meanwhile, is enhancing its TPUs' compatibility with PyTorch, aiming to ease customers' transition away from Nvidia. These developments threaten Nvidia\u2019s dominance, which has previously relied heavily on developer familiarity with its software ecosystem.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1765986480.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"companiesmarketcap.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/","title":"NVIDIA (NVDA) - Market capitalization","snippet":"As of December 2025 NVIDIA has a market cap of $4.406 Trillion USD.

In its latest East Asia and Pacific economic outlook, the World Bank also increased the 2025 regional growth estimate to 4.4%, but kept the 2026 forecast at 4.5%. The report attributes the weakening growth momentum to high global economic uncertainty, elevated trade barriers, and domestic unpredictability, particularly in Indonesia and Thailand. It highlights that many firms are delaying investments due to this uncertainty. Chinese economic indicators, including factory output and retail sales, show sluggish performance, prompting expectations of additional stimulus measures to achieve the government's 5% growth target. The World Bank advises that long-term domestic reforms may be more beneficial for sustainable development than short-term fiscal boosts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1759821239.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/36d49da64d52710d698348c89be79725","title":"Despite US trade war, OECD expects global economy will grow 3.2% this year","snippet":"Despite ongoing U.S. trade tensions under President Trump, the OECD has revised its global economic forecast upward, projecting growth of 3.2% for 2025, an improvement from its June estimate of 2.9%. This updated forecast follows global resilience and investment in areas like artificial intelligence. However, growth remains slightly down from 2024\u2019s 3.3%. For the U.S., growth is expected at 2% in 2025, still slower than the previous year\u2019s 2.8%, but higher than the earlier projection of 1.6%. Though Trump\u2019s administration imposed import tariffs aiming to protect U.S. industries, their impact was less severe than expected, partly because firms rushed imports ahead of the tariffs. The outlook for China remains steady at 5% growth, while India is forecast to lead major economies with 6.7% growth. The eurozone is expected to see modest recovery at 1.3%, up from 0.8% in 2024. OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann warned that rising trade barriers may still curb future consumption and investment through higher prices.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1764636256.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/74224d84-8a7a-4d0d-a30d-1716e2d43b7a","title":"AI investment boom shielding US from sharp slowdown, says IMF","snippet":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its 2025 economic forecast for the U.S. and global economy, highlighting a surge in artificial intelligence investment as a key factor supporting U.S. growth. The U.S. economy is now projected to grow by 2% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026, outperforming other G7 nations despite a slowdown from 2.8% in 2024. Global GDP is expected to grow 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026.\n\nIMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas attributes the U.S.'s resilience to AI-related investments, which are enhancing financial conditions and boosting consumer wealth through rising tech stock valuations. However, he cautioned the boom may delay inflation control and limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to cut interest rates, as consumer demand remains high without corresponding gains in productivity.\n\nThe fund also noted that U.S. tariffs have had a limited impact on global output and inflation, though trade tensions with China remain concerning. The UK is projected to grow 1.3% in both 2025 and 2026, while China's growth remains steady at 4.8% in 2025 and 4.2% in 2026.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1760446803.338,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_694791f5a6708328a28563699d4f92ea","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for IMF WEO 2025 world GDP data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"3978c353-5350-48b8-ab6c-b989186f082e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"dc93b3e4-1164-4e88-b651-abb6ba2d09a9","turn_exchange_id":"43bcb53b-1cfa-43e3-b9a2-c3aa16e6688f"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"dc93b3e4-1164-4e88-b651-abb6ba2d09a9","children":["3491f7d9-696b-4b4b-82a7-840890a0baca"]},"3491f7d9-696b-4b4b-82a7-840890a0baca":{"id":"3491f7d9-696b-4b4b-82a7-840890a0baca","message":{"id":"3491f7d9-696b-4b4b-82a7-840890a0baca","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766298131.865519,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Finding alternative sources for world GDP","content":"The IMF Data Mapper isn't working, and screenshots aren't possible.

It\u2019s not the sum of what customers have already paid, and it\u2019s not limited by today\u2019s consumer spending.\n\nThat means a $10T market cap is (roughly) a claim like:  \n> \u201cWe think this business will throw off an enormous stream of profits for a long time, and we\u2019re willing to pay up for that stream.\u201d\n\n## What has to be true for a $10T company to be \u201cfundamentally justified\u201d?\nDo a back-of-envelope check. Suppose a mega-company trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 25 (not crazy for dominant tech in good times).\n\n- **$10T market cap / 25 \u2248 $400B/year in earnings**.\n- $400B is about **0.34% of world GDP** (~$117T). Not impossible in principle. It\u2019s just *huge*. \ue200cite\ue202turn17view1\ue201  \n\nBut now ask what that implies about *revenue*:\n- If net margins are 25%, you need **~$1.6T/year in revenue** to net $400B.\n- That\u2019s \u201cmultiple large industries combined\u201d scale, *unless* the firm becomes a tollbooth on many industries (platform/standards/protocol owner).\n\nAnother way: the \u201cperpetuity\u201d lens. If investors require ~10% and expect long-run growth ~3%, then a perpetuity-with-growth model says:\n- Required cash flow next year \u2248 **Market cap \u00d7 (r \u2212 g) = $10T \u00d7 7% = $700B/year**.\n\nSame conclusion: you\u2019re talking about firms that capture **hundreds of billions per year** in *profits/free cash flow*, not just \u201ca cool product.\u201d\n\n## Can the world \u201csupport\u201d multiple $10T firms?\nYes *in arithmetic*, but it forces one of these to be true:\n\n1) **The pie gets much bigger** (AI boosts productivity broadly, real output rises, incomes rise, spending rises).  \n2) **A larger share of the existing pie gets centralized** (winner-take-most + strong moats + high pricing power \u2192 more rents captured by a few firms).  \n3) **Valuations are partly optionality / bubble premium** (investors paying for the possibility of (1) or (2), not the base case).\n\nIn reality it\u2019s usually a mix.\n\nA useful distinction: **total value created** vs **value captured**.  \nAI could create massive benefits (consumer surplus, cost reductions, time saved), yet if competition is intense or models commoditize, the *captured* value (profits) could be far smaller than the *created* value. That\u2019s the \u201cgreat for society, mediocre for shareholders\u201d outcome.\n\n## Why the \u201ctrillions\u201d talk keeps showing up in AI\nA lot of the loudest claims aren\u2019t about near-term consumer subscription revenue; they\u2019re about **AI as infrastructure**\u2014something like electricity + software + labor substitution.\n\nSam Altman, for example, has publicly talked about:\n- committing ~$1.4T of infrastructure / ~30 gigawatts of compute capacity, and\n- needing to reach **\u201chundreds of billions a year\u201d** in revenue eventually. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn1view1\ue201  \n\nThat\u2019s consistent with the math above: trillion-scale valuations require **insane scale** or **insane margins**, usually both.\n\n## Where exponential extrapolation usually breaks\nTech adoption often *starts* exponential, then hits S-curves because of constraints:\n\n- **Demand saturation:** there\u2019s only so much attention/budget/time.  \n- **Competition/commoditization:** today\u2019s moat becomes tomorrow\u2019s feature.  \n- **Regulation/antitrust/national security:** especially when a firm starts looking like \u201cthe operating system of the economy.\u201d  \n- **Physical bottlenecks:** power, chips, data center buildout, skilled labor.\n\nThe \u201cfusion\u201d angle helps only indirectly: cheaper abundant energy lowers costs, but it doesn\u2019t automatically mean one firm captures the savings. Often savings get competed away into lower prices.\n\n## A sharp way to continue this\nPick which world you think we\u2019re in (even tentatively), because each leads to different conclusions:\n\n1) **Commodity AI world:** models cheap, many providers, value diffuses \u2192 fewer justified mega-valuations.  \n2) **Platform AI world:** one/few stacks dominate distribution + tooling + payments + identity \u2192 multiple $10T firms become plausible.  \n3) **State-capital AI world:** governments shape winners (security, chips, energy), profits look more like regulated utilities / defense primes.\n\nIf you tell me which of those feels closest to your current intuition, we can pressure-test it with a more concrete \u201cwho pays, how much, and why them?\u201d chain."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200finance\ue202turn0finance0\ue201","start_idx":0,"end_idx":23,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"finance","ref_index":0}],"alt":"## Stock market information for NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)\n- NVIDIA Corp is a equity in the USA market.\n- The price is 180.99 USD currently with a change of 6.71 USD (0.04%) from the previous close.\n- The latest open price was 176.66 USD and the intraday volume is 324925927.\n- The intraday high is 181.37 USD and the intraday low is 175.57 USD.\n- The latest trade time is Saturday, December 20, 09:15:00 +0800.\n","prompt_text":"NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a equity in the USA market.

Jones, a board member at Nvidia since 1993, sold $44 million worth of Nvidia stock, according to a regulatory filing. On December 15, 2025, Jones disposed of 250,000 shares at an average price of $177.33 per share. These shares were part of a long-held stake dating back to 1997, two years before Nvidia's initial public offering. Despite the sale, Jones still retains over 7 million shares through the H.C. Jones Living Trust. Nvidia declined to comment on the sale. The company has experienced strong growth, driven by rising demand for processors supporting artificial intelligence, with its stock up approximately 28% in 2025 and a market capitalization nearing $4.32 trillion, making it the most valuable chipmaker globally.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"NVIDIA (NVDA) - Market capitalization","url":"https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"As of December 2025 NVIDIA has a market cap of $4.406 Trillion USD.

This projection reflects a steady decline in global growth since the 2008-2009 financial crisis and includes downward revisions across all income groups, especially emerging markets. The IMF highlights risks posed by high interest rates, diminishing labor supply growth, and geoeconomic fragmentation, which collectively limit governments' ability to invest in social or environmental initiatives.\n\nTo reverse this trend, the IMF recommends policy measures to enhance labor and capital allocation, increase labor force participation, integrate migrants, and boost competition and trade openness. Productivity gains from AI could potentially raise growth by up to 0.8 percentage points, but this depends on its equitable implementation and managing potential job displacement. The IMF stresses the urgency of policy action to avoid worsening global poverty, social tensions, and threats to debt sustainability and green transition efforts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1712750595.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/cross-border-challenges-widen-wealth-gap-between-europe-us-imf-study-finds-2024-11-14/","title":"Cross-border challenges widen wealth gap between Europe and US, IMF study finds","snippet":"A recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) study reveals that cross-border challenges are contributing to a widening economic gap between Europe and the United States. As of now, the European Union's GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is around 72% of the U.S. level. The primary driver of this gap\u2014accounting for 70%\u2014is slower productivity growth in Europe. The IMF attributes this to market fragmentation within the EU, with internal trade barriers among its 27 member states preventing firms from scaling operations across the entire bloc, unlike the more unified U.S. market.\n\nAdditionally, Europe lacks a unified capital market, leaving companies dependent on bank loans rather than equity funding, which hinders especially tech firms with intangible assets. Venture capital options remain underdeveloped and national in scope due to regulatory complexity. Efforts to create a Capital Markets Union have been ongoing but face slow progress.\n\nThe third major challenge is labor mobility. European workers face higher relocation costs and housing shortages, making cross-country movement within the EU more difficult than between U.S. states. The IMF emphasizes that solutions are within the EU\u2019s control, and EU leaders have asked the European Commission to propose improvements to the single market by mid-2025.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":48},"pub_date":1731563373.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/74224d84-8a7a-4d0d-a30d-1716e2d43b7a","title":"AI investment boom shielding US from sharp slowdown, says IMF","snippet":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its 2025 economic forecast for the U.S. and global economy, highlighting a surge in artificial intelligence investment as a key factor supporting U.S. growth. The U.S. economy is now projected to grow by 2% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026, outperforming other G7 nations despite a slowdown from 2.8% in 2024. Global GDP is expected to grow 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026.\n\nIMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas attributes the U.S.'s resilience to AI-related investments, which are enhancing financial conditions and boosting consumer wealth through rising tech stock valuations. However, he cautioned the boom may delay inflation control and limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to cut interest rates, as consumer demand remains high without corresponding gains in productivity.\n\nThe fund also noted that U.S. tariffs have had a limited impact on global output and inflation, though trade tensions with China remain concerning. The UK is projected to grow 1.3% in both 2025 and 2026, while China's growth remains steady at 4.8% in 2025 and 4.2% in 2026.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1760446803.338,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_694795e725c0832588753e6513d9e511","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing authoritative sources on GDP and wellbeing","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"da6bf3e4-7a04-4d0d-8d2f-9aea40c1d8ba","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"b1b78e3e-4bdb-4725-aaba-ce409909fcc1","turn_exchange_id":"640aabdb-5f88-47bc-84d0-88f84efab836"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b1b78e3e-4bdb-4725-aaba-ce409909fcc1","children":["7f977b63-4010-466b-a0a7-f28582a49761"]},"7f977b63-4010-466b-a0a7-f28582a49761":{"id":"7f977b63-4010-466b-a0a7-f28582a49761","message":{"id":"7f977b63-4010-466b-a0a7-f28582a49761","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766299119.371983,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Explaining GDP and the role of intangible value","content":"The user\u2019s claim about wealth and value needing more materials or energy is partly true but ignores intangibles like knowledge, health, and social capital.

widespread criticism. It contrasts the economic paths of Bhutan, which prioritizes Gross National Happiness (GNH), with South Korea, which aggressively pursued GDP-driven growth. Bhutan's focus on happiness has yielded limited benefits in global happiness rankings and economic terms, while South Korea's GDP-focused strategy resulted in impressive improvements in life expectancy, income, and quality of life.\n\nThe article emphasizes that while GDP does not capture unpaid labor, environmental degradation, or wealth inequality, it remains the most robust, timely, and comparable measure for tracking economic development. Originating in the 1930s, GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country. Despite critiques from economists and policymakers who advocate for well-being, happiness, or sustainability indices, GDP\u2019s strong correlation with outcomes like longevity, lower infant mortality, and reduced poverty underscores its indispensability.\n\nUltimately, while GDP isn't a perfect proxy for human flourishing, it is uniquely suited to reflect the productive capacity necessary for improving quality of life, and no viable alternative currently rivals its utility for policymaking and international comparisons.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1765796400.0,"attribution":"www.vox.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.worldbank.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/the-changing-wealth-of-nations","title":"The Changing Wealth of Nations 2024","snippet":"The World Bank 2024 Changing Wealth of Nations (CWON) report offers a comprehensive view of a country's wealth by accounting for natural and human capital,","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.worldbank.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/environment/publication/changing-wealth-of-nations","title":"The Changing Wealth of Nations","snippet":"Close to one third of the wealth of low-income countries comes from their \u201cnatural capital\u201d which includes forests, protected areas, agricultural lands, energy ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":1472590906.776,"attribution":"www.worldbank.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/changing-wealth-of-nations","title":"The Changing Wealth of Nations 2021","snippet":"It contains the widest set of assets covered so far, including human capital broken down by gender, as well as many different forms of natural capital, spanning ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},"pub_date":1731584503.725,"attribution":"www.worldbank.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"databank.worldbank.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://databank.worldbank.org/source/wealth-accounts/preview/on","title":"Wealth Accounts - DataBank - World Bank","snippet":"Total wealth encompasses produced capital, renewable natural capital, nonrenewable natural capital, human capital, and net foreign assets.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"databank.worldbank.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.imf.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/series/back-to-basics/gross-domestic-product-gdp","title":"Gross Domestic Product: An Economy's All","snippet":"It is also important to understand what GDP cannot tell us.

The author explains that GDP measures economic output, not well-being, and that government expenditure\u2014such as on education and defense\u2014is essential to understanding economic activity. The inclusion of government spending in GDP was debated historically and supported by Keynesian economic theory, which views government demand as a key part of aggregate demand.\n\nThe piece highlights that not all valuable activities\u2014like housework or raising children\u2014are captured in GDP, and that excluding non-market contributions or taxpayer-funded services would misrepresent economic reality. It also revisits Robert Kennedy\u2019s 1968 critique of GDP, calling it misleading to expect GDP to encompass broader societal values like child health or poetic beauty.\n\nUltimately, the article emphasizes that GDP should be improved to better measure productive output, not redefined to measure well-being. For assessing quality of life, separate tools such as the World Happiness Report are more suitable. The author warns against viewing GDP as an all-encompassing score of progress and criticizes Musk\u2019s gamified outlook on human development.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1743138038.37,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_694795e725c0832588753e6513d9e511","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for GDP limitations, wealth, and alternative measures","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"da6bf3e4-7a04-4d0d-8d2f-9aea40c1d8ba","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"b24334a4-e34d-47e3-b119-c0ae2a214556","turn_exchange_id":"640aabdb-5f88-47bc-84d0-88f84efab836"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b24334a4-e34d-47e3-b119-c0ae2a214556","children":["2e1f1b1d-a4a5-4fad-8fd9-f447ca257a2f"]},"2e1f1b1d-a4a5-4fad-8fd9-f447ca257a2f":{"id":"2e1f1b1d-a4a5-4fad-8fd9-f447ca257a2f","message":{"id":"2e1f1b1d-a4a5-4fad-8fd9-f447ca257a2f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766299131.659255,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clarifying world GDP growth and its limits","content":"I\u2019ll explain world GDP growth mechanisms, highlight the difference between GDP growth and real wealth, and clarify that GDP is a flow while wealth is a stock.

You don\u2019t need to love the model for it to be useful: it\u2019s basically a **bookkeeping identity for sources of growth**.\n\n### Important implication for your \u201cmaterials + energy\u201d thesis\nMaterials and energy matter because they\u2019re inputs into production. But **GDP can rise even if material/energy throughput doesn\u2019t rise much**, if \\(A\\) rises (efficiency, knowledge, better designs) or if the economy shifts toward **services and intangibles**.\n\nExample: A smartphone can replace a camera, GPS unit, music player, and many other devices while using *less* material than the bundle it replaces\u2014yet it can raise measured GDP (and certainly raises consumer value).\n\nSo: **energy/material throughput is a constraint**, but not a one-to-one driver of GDP in a modern economy.\n\n## 3) GDP growth vs \u201ctrue wealth\u201d (stock vs flow)\nGDP is a flow. \u201cWealth\u201d is a stock.\n\nA country (or person) can have:\n- high GDP but low wealth accumulation (if depreciation is high, resources are depleted, or profits are sent abroad),\n- or rising wealth without rising GDP (asset prices rise; not production).\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s \u201cChanging Wealth of Nations\u201d work is basically built around this distinction: *countries measure GDP routinely, but wealth requires tracking produced capital, human capital, natural capital, plus net foreign assets.* \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search4\ue201\n\nThis matters a lot for \u201ctrue progress\u201d: you can boost GDP today by running down natural capital (forests, fisheries, soil quality), but that can **lower comprehensive wealth**.\n\n## 4) GDP growth vs \u201cvalue in one\u2019s life\u201d\nEven the IMF is blunt that GDP is **not** a measure of overall well-being. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search9\ue201  \nAnd the Stiglitz\u2013Sen\u2013Fitoussi Commission report is essentially a systematic critique of using GDP as \u201csocial progress.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201\n\nHere are the main ways GDP and lived value diverge:\n\n### A) Non-market value (big one)\n- Household production, caregiving, volunteering: real value, often not in GDP. The BEA notes household production is excluded largely due to measurement/data problems in national accounting guidelines. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\nSo two societies can have identical lived outcomes, but the one that pays for childcare/cooking has higher GDP than the one that does it at home.\n\n### B) Consumer surplus (value you get beyond what you pay)\nA lot of modern \u201cquality of life\u201d value shows up as **time saved, convenience, entertainment, information**\u2014often cheap or free. GDP records what you pay, not how much it was worth to you.\n\n### C) Defensive and repair spending\nDisasters, pollution, crime, illness can raise GDP via cleanup, healthcare bills, security spending\u2014while making life worse. (The Stiglitz-style critique focuses on exactly these interpretive traps.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201\n\n### D) Distribution\nGDP per capita can rise while median households stagnate. GDP itself doesn\u2019t encode who gets the gains. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n\n### E) Externalities and sustainability\nEnvironmental degradation often isn\u2019t subtracted. A society can \u201cgrow\u201d by emitting costs into the future.\n\n## 5) A cleaner framework for what you\u2019re trying to reason about\nIf you want to connect \u201cfundamentals\u201d to your earlier multi-trillion-company question, separate:\n\n- **Productive capacity** (real GDP per capita, productivity) \u2192 what the economy *can* produce.  \n- **Capture** (profits, rents, monopoly power, platform tolls) \u2192 who gets paid.  \n- **Welfare** (health, leisure, security, meaning, environment) \u2192 what people actually experience.\n\nAI can plausibly raise **productive capacity** (productivity). Whether that translates into **profits** for a few firms or **broad welfare** for many people is a separate political-economy question, not just a tech one.\n\nIf you want to push this further, the most decisive next step is: **when you say \u201ctrue wealth/value,\u201d do you mean (i) comprehensive wealth of a society (assets), or (ii) experienced well-being (life quality)?** The diagnosis and metrics differ."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":648,"end_idx":680,"safe_urls":["https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/world-development-indicators/series/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG","https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/world-development-indicators/series/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/series/back-to-basics/gross-domestic-product-gdp","https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/series/back-to-basics/gross-domestic-product-gdp?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/series/back-to-basics/gross-domestic-product-gdp?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gross Domestic Product: An Economy's All","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/publications/fandd/issues/series/back-to-basics/gross-domestic-product-gdp?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"It is also important to understand what GDP cannot tell us.

So all the physical goods and comforts of life come from these after passing through a manufacturing process. \n\n(ii) Then there are intangibles like meaning, intellectual pursuits, luxury living, and other things needed to prolong life & health such as medical advancement, elder care. All these come under the umbrella of services, academia, investment in science, intellectual output. \n\nMy idea is that everything human society wants and is willing to pay for or work for falls under these two categories (i) and (ii).\n\nFor (i), we need to mine the Earth or harvest the sun's radiant energy. Manufactoring transforms raw inputs from (i) into all the food and all the material goods we use.\n\nFor (ii), we need intellectual labor, caregiving, human communication, coders, inventors, businessmen, merchants. Category (ii) involves the deployment of human intellect, communication and organization in fulfilment of needs other than those satisfies in category (i).\n\nSo what is productivity growth? It is about making the manufacturing process in (i) more efficient and making the deployment of intellect and organization and communication in (ii) more effective. \n\nNow I come to the crux: Is there so much inefficiency manufacturing for category (i) items and so much ineffectiveness in deployment of category (ii) ingredients so that the potential that AI can unlock in coming decades is literally in tens or hundreds of trillions of dollars?

This waste, amounting to 1.6 billion tons annually, contributes significantly to hunger and climate change, generating 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Much of this waste includes not only uneaten food but also byproducts from crop and animal processing that are typically discarded.\n\nHowever, the article highlights a transformative opportunity to repurpose food waste and byproducts into valuable products. Examples include whey in protein powders, aquafaba in vegan foods, and spent grain in alternative meat production. New technologies, such as biotechnology and AI, can further enhance this upcycling process, turning waste into high-value inputs for industries beyond food, including cosmetics, textiles, and construction. This shift could unlock over $1 trillion annually in economic value.\n\nThe article emphasizes that the main barriers are structural\u2014such as focus on yield over efficiency, lack of waste utilization infrastructure, and outdated business models. It advocates for system-wide innovation and cross-industry collaboration to transition to a circular bioeconomy where food production generates minimal waste and maximum value.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1757407523.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/18018b352ac6bd7be9925e15511254ac","title":"783 million people face chronic hunger. Yet the world wastes 19% of its food, UN says","snippet":"A new United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report reveals that in 2022, 19% of the world\u2019s food\u2014around 1.05 billion metric tons\u2014was wasted, despite 783 million people facing chronic hunger globally. Most waste originated in households (60%), followed by food services (28%) and retailers (12%). Each person wastes approximately 79 kilograms of food annually, equating to over 1 billion meals lost daily.\n\nThe UNEP and Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) co-authored the report, noting improved data reporting, particularly from low- and middle-income countries. The report emphasizes food waste's environmental impact, contributing to 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions\u2014comparable to the world\u2019s third-largest emitter after China and the U.S. Key drivers include resource wastage and methane emissions.\n\nExperts call for increased policy action and public-private partnerships to reduce waste, especially from wealthier nations. Food redistribution efforts, such as those by Food Banking Kenya, help combat waste and support vulnerable populations. The report stresses that food waste is a global issue\u2014not confined to high-income countries\u2014and an urgent area for environmental and humanitarian action.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1711543003.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/fifth-of-food-wasted-globally-at-cost-of-1tn-a-year-says-un-report","title":"Millions go hungry as a billion meals binned every day, says UN report","snippet":"A new UN report reveals that over 1 billion meals are wasted daily across both rich and poor countries, despite 730 million people suffering from hunger. Approximately 20% of global food is wasted annually, costing around $1 trillion. Households are the largest contributors (60%), followed by food services (28%) and retail (12%). An additional 13% of food is lost between harvest and market. This waste heavily impacts the environment, causing nearly 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to biodiversity loss through deforestation for agriculture.\n\nThe UN Environment Programme and the UK's WRAP highlight the need for urgent action, with few countries including food waste in their climate policies. Hotter climates and inadequate food storage are key factors in food spoilage globally. Poorer households waste only slightly less than wealthier ones, due to systemic issues like lack of refrigeration and time constraints.\n\nSome countries, such as Japan and the UK, have seen significant reductions since 2007. Experts call for stronger collaboration with food banks and broader food system reforms. In the UK, \u00a3295 million has been allocated to support weekly food waste collections, aimed at promoting composting and changing consumption habits.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1711546084.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6947bc8613e88326a2fd376f94d50000","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching AI impact and global GDP projections","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"b13c261a-7b9e-48d6-8087-d6443c9a027b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d0475f1c-5fe0-43f0-95ec-02afc95dc8c3","turn_exchange_id":"461dd855-40fb-4259-9dc3-0622c232b6c1"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d0475f1c-5fe0-43f0-95ec-02afc95dc8c3","children":["193dcdb7-a5fb-4c71-b02d-976d11399662"]},"193dcdb7-a5fb-4c71-b02d-976d11399662":{"id":"193dcdb7-a5fb-4c71-b02d-976d11399662","message":{"id":"193dcdb7-a5fb-4c71-b02d-976d11399662","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766309009.319309,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clarifying energy-related constraints","content":"I should include a note on energy constraints, maybe citing the IEA about data center energy consumption.

These institutions\u2014including hedge funds, private credit firms, pension funds, insurers, and money market funds\u2014now control 51% of global financial assets, totaling $256.8 trillion. A narrower segment of these players, which pose more direct financial stability risks, saw asset growth of 12.7%, reaching $76.3 trillion, with particularly rapid expansion in emerging markets.\n\nThe FSB expressed concerns about the sector\u2019s rising influence and lack of transparency, warning that problems in this area could pose risks to broader financial markets. Factors contributing to this growth include increased risk appetite, higher asset prices, and lower interest rates. In response, global regulators, including the Bank of England, are intensifying scrutiny\u2014planning stress tests for private equity and credit markets and questioning the robustness of lending standards, particularly in light of recent bankruptcies in the U.S. The FSB highlighted continued challenges in data availability for private credit, stating that monitoring such risks will be a key priority in the coming year.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1765876426.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.vox.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.vox.com/policy/471950/gross-domestic-product-economics-metrics-growth","title":"The only number that really matters","snippet":"This article explores the enduring value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a key indicator of national progress, development, and well-being, despite widespread criticism.

Bhutan's focus on happiness has yielded limited benefits in global happiness rankings and economic terms, while South Korea's GDP-focused strategy resulted in impressive improvements in life expectancy, income, and quality of life.\n\nThe article emphasizes that while GDP does not capture unpaid labor, environmental degradation, or wealth inequality, it remains the most robust, timely, and comparable measure for tracking economic development. Originating in the 1930s, GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country. Despite critiques from economists and policymakers who advocate for well-being, happiness, or sustainability indices, GDP\u2019s strong correlation with outcomes like longevity, lower infant mortality, and reduced poverty underscores its indispensability.\n\nUltimately, while GDP isn't a perfect proxy for human flourishing, it is uniquely suited to reflect the productive capacity necessary for improving quality of life, and no viable alternative currently rivals its utility for policymaking and international comparisons.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1765796400.0,"attribution":"www.vox.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"data.worldbank.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.SRV.TOTL.ZS","title":"Services, value added (% of GDP)","snippet":"Services, value added (annual % growth) \u00b7 Services, value added (constant ... 2023. 91.2.

This growth reflects a sharp rise from 2.4% in 2021 and outpaces the 2.4% of GDP spent on defense in 2023. The U.S. bore the highest interest cost at 4.7% of GDP, followed by the UK at 2.9% and Germany at 1%. Rising bond yields and increased borrowing due to fiscal stimulus and defense spending have heightened debt servicing costs. Sovereign debt in wealthy countries is projected to hit $17 trillion in 2025, up from $14 trillion in 2023.\n\nThe OECD warns this trend could limit future borrowing capacity amid growing investment needs, particularly for infrastructure and climate initiatives. Almost 45% of OECD debt is set to mature by 2027, much of it issued under previously favorable conditions. With central banks winding down bond-buying programs, private investors, who are more sensitive to price fluctuations, now hold a larger share of sovereign bonds\u2014exposing markets to greater volatility and geopolitical risk. The OECD stresses that future borrowing must drive economic growth to stabilize and ultimately reduce debt-to-GDP ratios.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1742464922.924,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6947bc8613e88326a2fd376f94d50000","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Critiquing

AI is expected to lower trade costs, increase productivity, and benefit small producers and retailers through tools like AI-powered translation. The report suggests that AI could notably enhance export growth in low-income countries if they invest in digital infrastructure. However, it also warns of deepening economic divides without inclusive policies, potentially leaving certain workers and economies behind. WTO leadership emphasized the importance of domestic investment in education, reskilling, and social safety nets to manage labor market disruptions. It also called for stable trade policies and reduced tariffs on key AI-related materials, such as semiconductors, to ensure AI's benefits are broadly distributed.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1758102808.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/travel-industry-contribute-record-11-trillion-global-gdp-2024-2024-09-03/","title":"Travel industry to contribute record $11 trillion to global GDP in 2024","snippet":"The global travel and tourism industry is projected to contribute a record $11.1 trillion to the world\u2019s GDP in 2024, equivalent to 10% of the global GDP, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). This represents a 12.1% year-over-year increase and surpasses the previous high set in 2019 by 7.5%. Driven by consumers increasingly prioritizing travel in their budgets, spending on hotels, cruises, and flights is surging. The U.S., China, and Germany are expected to lead in travel-related GDP contributions. Employment in the sector is also booming, with nearly 348 million jobs forecasted globally in 2024\u201413.6 million more than the pre-pandemic high in 2019. The U.S. alone has around 1 million job openings in leisure and hospitality, and the sector supported 27 million jobs in 2023.

The report suggests that AI could notably enhance export growth in low-income countries if they invest in digital infrastructure. However, it also warns of deepening economic divides without inclusive policies, potentially leaving certain workers and economies behind. WTO leadership emphasized the importance of domestic investment in education, reskilling, and social safety nets to manage labor market disruptions. It also called for stable trade policies and reduced tariffs on key AI-related materials, such as semiconductors, to ensure AI's benefits are broadly distributed.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1758102808.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wto.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news25_e/wtr_15sep25_e.htm","title":"AI to boost trade by nearly 40% by 2040 if gaps are bridged ...","snippet":"17 Sept 2025 \u2014 According to the report, AI could lead to significant increases in trade and GDP by 2040, with global trade projected to rise by 34-37% across ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.wto.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/wtr25_e.pdf","title":"Making trade and AI work together to the benefit of all","snippet":"The 2025 World Trade Report explores the complex and fast-evolving relationship between artificial intelligence.

The WTO\u2019s annual trade report estimates AI could increase global trade in goods and services by nearly 40% by 2040, but without inclusive access, poorer nations may be left behind. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala urged rich countries not to repeat the mistakes of past globalisation, where many regions were excluded from the gains. Currently, AI resources\u2014including hardware production and raw materials like gallium and germanium\u2014are highly concentrated in a few wealthy nations. If low-income countries can halve their \"digital infrastructure gap,\" their income growth related to AI adoption could rise to 15% by 2040, compared to just 8% if no action is taken.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of broader manufacturing of AI hardware and warns about the risk of regulatory fragmentation, which could hinder AI's contribution to international trade. Experts also stress the need for updated WTO rules to reflect the digital economy and caution against overreliance on AI in areas like customs compliance, which could pose legal and financial risks.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1758101406.1,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6947bc8613e88326a2fd376f94d50000","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for WTO World Trade Report 2025","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"b13c261a-7b9e-48d6-8087-d6443c9a027b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d5cafeed-25d5-45d5-b465-4139631db3af","turn_exchange_id":"461dd855-40fb-4259-9dc3-0622c232b6c1"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d5cafeed-25d5-45d5-b465-4139631db3af","children":["45626c46-406b-43ce-9939-ea07dca761c4"]},"45626c46-406b-43ce-9939-ea07dca761c4":{"id":"45626c46-406b-43ce-9939-ea07dca761c4","message":{"id":"45626c46-406b-43ce-9939-ea07dca761c4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766309111.736662,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Refining economic model and supporting evidence for growth","content":"I\u2019ll start by acknowledging the user\u2019s two-category model and refine it.

However, the IMF warned that a potential escalation of the U.S.-China trade war \u2014 marked by President Donald Trump's latest tariff threat \u2014 poses a significant risk to this growth. A downside scenario involving steep tariff increases could cut global growth by up to 1.8 percentage points by 2027.\n\nDespite these risks, the U.S. economy shows resilience, with the 2025 growth forecast upgraded to 2.0%, supported by tax legislation and AI-driven investment. Other regional upgrades include the eurozone (1.2%), Japan (1.1%), and Latin America, notably Mexico. China's growth forecast remains unchanged at 4.8% for 2025, though the outlook is clouded by ongoing property sector issues and financial instability.\n\nGlobal inflation predictions remain steady, although they are diverging across regions. Inflation is expected to rise in the U.S. due to tariff effects, while some Asian countries see decreases amid slower growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1760484136.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/world-bank-slashes-global-growth-forecast-trade-tensions-bite-2025-06-10/","title":"World Bank cuts global growth forecast as trade tensions heighten uncertainty","snippet":"The World Bank has significantly cut its global growth forecast for 2025 to 2.3%, citing escalating trade tensions and global uncertainty, especially due to U.S. tariff policies under President Trump. The report highlights reductions in projected growth for nearly 70% of economies, including the U.S., China, Europe, and several emerging markets. While it does not predict a global recession, it notes that 2025 could see the weakest non-recessionary growth since 2008. Trade growth is also expected to drop steeply, from 3.4% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025, with inflation remaining elevated at 2.9%.\n\nThe World Bank attributes worsening conditions to rising tariffs, financial volatility, and dampened business confidence. It warns that further tariff hikes could shave an additional 0.5% off growth. Despite this, it anticipates gradual improvements post-2025 if trade uncertainty resolves. While the White House disputes the forecast\u2014pointing to strong investment and income data\u2014the eurozone, Japan, and Mexico also face downgraded growth projections. Meanwhile, developing countries risk long-term stagnation, with some projected to take decades to recover from pandemic-era losses.

While global GDP growth for 2025 is revised up slightly to 3.2%, the IMF maintains a cautious outlook, keeping the 2026 forecast at 3.1% and describing the longer-term prospects as \"dim.\" The Fund highlights that protectionist measures have had a limited initial impact, attributing this to companies and consumers advancing purchases before tariffs took effect. However, it warns of delayed effects possibly harming investment, especially in the U.S.\n\nImmigration crackdowns in countries like the U.S. could reduce GDP and fuel inflation in sectors reliant on immigrant labor. The IMF also points to risks from high stock valuations and overinvestment in AI, suggesting that a sharp market correction could curb overall investment. The UK saw a modest GDP forecast upgrade, with expectations to be the second-fastest growing G7 economy in 2025. Still, inflation is set to rise, potentially leading to delayed interest rate cuts.

The main tweak I\u2019d make is: these aren\u2019t separable sectors\u2014**(B) mostly creates value by arranging (A) better** (designs, incentives, scheduling, error-correction, logistics, research), and (B) itself runs on physical substrate (people + buildings + chips + electricity).\n\n### What \u201cproductivity growth\u201d really is\nIn growth accounting, productivity is basically \u201c**more valued output per unit input**,\u201d where inputs are labor hours, capital, and materials/energy. The residual is **TFP (total factor productivity)**: improvements in *how* we combine inputs\u2014tech, processes, management, allocation, coordination.\n\nThat framing matters because it immediately suggests where huge gains can come from:\n\n- Not only \u201cusing less energy/material per widget,\u201d  \n- but also \u201cwasting less,\u201d \u201cmaking fewer mistakes,\u201d \u201cmatching supply/demand better,\u201d \u201cmoving information faster,\u201d \u201creducing delays,\u201d \u201creducing search/transaction costs,\u201d and \u201cinventing better products.\u201d\n\nThose last items are overwhelmingly **information/coordination** problems\u2014exactly where AI can bite.\n\n### Is there enough \u201cslack\u201d for AI to unlock multi-trillion value?\nA good way to keep yourself honest is: **trillions per year vs trillions over decades**.\n\n#### 1) \u201cHundreds of trillions per year\u201d \u2014 basically no\nWorld GDP is about **$117.17T (2025, current USD) per IMF WEO October 2025**. \ue200cite\ue202turn9search3\ue201  \nSo \u201chundreds of trillions *annually*\u201d would mean \u201cseveral whole new world economies,\u201d every year. That\u2019s not a sensible interpretation.\n\n#### 2) \u201cA few trillion per year\u201d \u2014 yes, very plausible *as an order of magnitude*\nMajor estimates for generative AI alone sit in the **single-digit trillions per year** range:\n\n- McKinsey estimates generative AI could add **$2.6T to $4.4T annually** across use cases. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- McKinsey also frames this as labor-productivity uplift of **~0.1% to 0.6% per year through 2040** from genAI, with wider automation potentially adding more depending on adoption and task mix. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- Goldman Sachs argues genAI could raise global GDP by **~7%** and lift productivity growth by **~1.5 percentage points** over a decade after broad adoption. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n\nThose are not \u201cphysics-breaking\u201d; they\u2019re \u201chuge, but within world-scale arithmetic.\u201d\n\n#### 3) \u201cTens or hundreds of trillions over decades\u201d \u2014 yes, purely via compounding (but it\u2019s a strong claim)\nThis is where people talk past each other.\n\nIf AI raises global real growth by even **+1 percentage point** (say baseline 2% \u2192 3%) for a long time, the *level* effect gets big:\n\n- After 30 years, output is about **35% higher** than otherwise (because \\((1.03/1.02)^{30}\\approx 1.35\\)).  \n- With today\u2019s $117T scale, that becomes \u201cdozens of trillions per year\u201d by the end of the period, and **the cumulative extra production across 30 years** can easily be in the **hundreds of trillions**.\n\nSo \u201chundreds of trillions\u201d becomes plausible **only** if it means \u201cadded output summed over many years\u201d (or present value of decades of gains), not \u201cextra output this year.\u201d\n\n### Where the \u201cslack\u201d actually is (and where it isn\u2019t)\nTo your question\u2014*is the economy really that inefficient?*\u2014the answer is \u201cyes in some ways, but the unlock isn\u2019t a free lunch.\u201d\n\n#### Physical throughput (atoms)\nThere is real waste:\n- Food loss/waste is often cited around **one-third of food produced** globally (classic FAO estimate). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\nBut turning waste into **measured GDP gains** is subtle:\n- Reducing waste can lower costs and raise real living standards, but it may show up as **lower prices** (consumer benefit) more than \u201cnew revenue.\u201d\n- Some waste is incentive-driven (who bears the cost?) rather than information-driven.\n\nAI helps here mainly by **prediction + control**: forecasting demand, routing logistics, preventive maintenance, process control, materials discovery. Useful, but many bottlenecks remain physical (capex, build times, regulation).\n\n#### Coordination/knowledge work (bits)\nThis is the big one. Modern economies are largely **services and information processing**, and there are massive \u201cfriction costs\u201d:\n- searching, summarizing, scheduling, compliance, customer support,\n- translation across languages and systems,\n- writing/reading/review cycles,\n- error correction and rework,\n- slow diffusion of best practices.\n\nThe WTO\u2019s 2025 World Trade Report explicitly models AI as reducing trade frictions and boosting productivity, estimating **global GDP could be 12\u201313% higher by 2040** under scenarios. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7search3\ue201  \nThat\u2019s exactly the \u201ccoordination unlock\u201d story.\n\n### The hard part: \u201cpotential\u201d is not the same as \u201crealized,\u201d and \u201crealized\u201d is not the same as \u201ccaptured\u201d\nEven if the technical capability exists, the realized macro impact depends on:\n\n1) **Diffusion speed** (software ships fast; institutions move slow).  \n2) **Complementary investments** (data cleanup, workflow redesign, compute, cybersecurity, training).  \n3) **Task reallocation** (productivity gains require people/capital to move to new work, not just \u201cdo the same work faster and stop\u201d). McKinsey explicitly conditions gains on this kind of shift. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n4) **Demand** (if productivity rises but demand doesn\u2019t, you get unemployment/idle capacity rather than more output).  \n5) **Competition** (value created can become consumer surplus; profits can be competed away).\n\nThat last point connects back to your original \u201cmega-market-cap\u201d concern: **society can gain trillions and firms can still fail to capture it** if AI becomes cheap and commoditized.\n\n### A crisp way to test \u201chundreds of trillions\u201d claims\nWhenever you hear a huge number, ask which one it is:\n\n- **Annual GDP increase** (per year)  \n- **Cumulative GDP increase** (summed over 10\u201330 years)  \n- **Present value** of future gains (a discounted stock)  \n- **Corporate profit pool** (subset of GDP, and highly sensitive to competition)\n\nMost \u201castronomical\u201d numbers become reasonable only in the **cumulative** or **present value** sense.\n\nIf you want, in the next step we can pick a horizon (10, 20, 30 years) and do a clean decomposition: \u201cWhat % of global labor tasks are plausibly accelerated by X%, what adoption curve, what fraction becomes measured GDP vs consumer surplus vs lower prices?\u201d That\u2019s the shortest path from fundamentals to \u201cis this trend sustainable or narrative inflation?\u201d"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn9search3\ue201","start_idx":1544,"end_idx":1563,"safe_urls":["https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD%40WEO","https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD%40WEO?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD%40WEO?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"World Economic Outlook (October 2025) - GDP, current ...","url":"https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD%40WEO?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Billions of U.S. dollars ; Emerging market and developing economies. 48.57 thousand ; Advanced economies. 68.6 thousand ; World. 117.17 thousand.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"IMF"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":1972,"end_idx":1991,"safe_urls":["https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Economic potential of generative AI","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1686614400.0,"snippet":"14 Jun 2023 \u2014 Our latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"McKinsey & Company"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":2188,"end_idx":2207,"safe_urls":["https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/media-center/ai-could-increase-corporate-profits-by-4-trillion-a-year-according-to-new-research","https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/media-center/ai-could-increase-corporate-profits-by-4-trillion-a-year-according-to-new-research?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/media-center/ai-could-increase-corporate-profits-by-4-trillion-a-year-according-to-new-research?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI could increase corporate profits by $4.4 trillion a year ...","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/media-center/ai-could-increase-corporate-profits-by-4-trillion-a-year-according-to-new-research?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1688688000.0,"snippet":"7 Jul 2023 \u2014 We estimate that generative AI could increase labor productivity by 0.1% to 0.6% annually through 2040.
