Joy won\u2019t vanish, but *what it means to \u201cdo math\u201d* may shift more radically than what happened in chess.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack that.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why the chess analogy is partly reassuring \u2013 and partly misleading\n\nYour premise is right: once engines became superhuman, chess didn\u2019t die.\n\nWhy?\n\n- **The human tournament is intact.**  \n  As long as you can run tournaments where people sit at boards with no engines, there is still a meaningful human skill ladder.\n\n- **The drama is inherently human.**  \n  We don\u2019t care about Stockfish vs Stockfish in the same way. The story is Carlsen, Praggnanandhaa, Firouzja, etc. We watch people crack under pressure, not silicon.\n\n- **Engines raised the ceiling and deepened appreciation.**  \n  Prep, study, and commentary got better. Engines became \u201cperfect trainers\u201d and analysis partners.\n\nBut chess has special properties that *do not* carry over cleanly to math:\n\n1. Chess is a **self-contained performance game** with no external stakes.  \n   A brilliant game doesn\u2019t change the physical world. Math does: cryptography, algorithms, physics, finance, etc. That matters for how capital, institutions, and automation pressure the field.\n\n2. It is relatively easy to **police engine use** in a top tournament.  \n   For math, especially research and even some competitions, drawing a clean line between \u201cAI-assisted\u201d and \u201cnot\u201d will be much harder.\n\n3. Chess engines, despite being godlike evaluators, **don\u2019t explain their insights in human conceptual terms**.  \n   In math, serious AI systems *will* be built explicitly to produce human-legible proofs, expositions, and lecture notes. That alters the human niche more directly.\n\nSo the chess story is a *partial* analogy. It tells you something about human appetite for intellectual games in a post-superhuman world \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t fully constrain what will happen in math.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Recreational math: likely *more* flourishing, not less\n\nHere I\u2019m almost completely bullish.\n\nThink of:\n\n- Interactive tutors that can:\n  - Generate bespoke puzzles at exactly the right level.\n  - Adapt to a learner\u2019s misconceptions in real time.\n  - Turn dry topics into guided \u201cadventures\u201d with narrative and visuals.\n\n- Automatic \u201cpuzzle engines\u201d that:\n  - Search huge spaces of problems for those with elegant solutions.\n  - Rank puzzles by novelty, beauty, difficulty, and pedagogical value.\n\n- Content creators (YouTube, Twitch, blogs) that:\n  - Use AI to help with diagrams, animations, and checks.\n  - Spend more time on *storytelling* and conceptual framing.\n\nThe chess analogue here is strong:  \nengines didn\u2019t kill casual chess; they made tactics trainers, online rapid, and commentary vastly better.  \n\nFor math:\n\n- Recreational problem solving will be easier to enter (good scaffolding, hints, diagnostics).\n- The *top* recreational culture (AoPS-type communities, puzzle channels, etc.) probably gets deeper and weirder.\n\n**Possible downside:** a lot of people will just let the machine do the puzzle.  \nBut that\u2019s already true with solutions manuals. The human appetite for \u201cI want to *wrestle* with this myself\u201d hasn\u2019t vanished, and AI can be set up in \u201cno direct solution, only hints\u201d modes.\n\nSo at the level of **math as a hobby**, I\u2019d expect something very much like the chess story: more people, more content, more tools, more joy.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Competitive math: olympiads, contests, and the \u201cno-AI bubble\u201d\n\nHere we need to split **training** from **competition**.\n\n### Training\n\nAI is going to do for contest math what engines did for opening prep:\n\n- Generate problem sets with fine-tuned difficulty curves.\n- Classify problems by \u201ckey idea\u201d and target specific weaknesses.\n- Give extremely granular feedback on solution scripts.\n- Simulate an experienced coach available 24/7.\n\nThe practical consequence:  \nthe *average* serious contestant becomes much stronger, much faster. The baseline goes up.\n\n### Competition\n\nFor the contests themselves:\n\n- **In-person exams** can maintain a \u201cno AI\u201d bubble, the way OTB tournaments prohibit engines.  \n  Pen-and-paper / on-premise computer systems with no network are easy enough to enforce.\n\n- The formats may change:\n  - More emphasis on **explaining reasoning orally**.\n  - Multi-step or multi-day projects where \u201ccopy-paste from AI\u201d is less viable.\n  - Greater focus on *novel problem posing* or conceptual discussion.\n\nWhere the analogy breaks slightly:  \nin chess, cheating is a serious issue, but top events can still be tightly controlled.  \n\nIn math:\n\n- For **remote** or lower-tier contests, AI will absolutely flood the zone.  \n  A lot of \u201conline contests\u201d will quietly become: \u201cWho can best prompt an AI and then clean up the solution?\u201d\n\nAs long as you care about *human-only* performance and you\u2019re willing to have **strict, physical, supervised settings**, you can preserve a meaningful competitive ladder. But the ecosystem will bifurcate: \u201cAI-allowed\u201d vs \u201cAI-free.\u201d The latter becomes the prestige human performance niche.\n\nWill people still care about IMO / Putnam\u2013style contests in 10\u201320 years?  \nI\u2019d say yes \u2014 in fact, they might become *more* iconic as rare, genuinely human tournaments in a world of ubiquitous AI.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Research mathematics: where things genuinely get weird\n\nThis is the real crux for someone like you.\n\nChess superintelligence did *not* change the fact that:\n\n- Games are small enough to understand.\n- The human is the protagonist.\n\nIn math, we face a different prospect:\n\n- AI systems that can **conjecture, prove, and formalize at scale**.\n- Automated theorem provers integrated with large language models that:\n  - Suggest lemmas.\n  - Fill in routine proofs.\n  - Search massive combinatorial spaces for counterexamples.\n\nLet me carve the research landscape into layers.\n\n### 4.1. The \u201croutine and local\u201d layer\n\n- Checking long but conceptually straightforward arguments.\n- Grinding technical lemmas.\n- Exploring parameter regimes, special cases, and explicit computations.\n\nThis layer is almost guaranteed to be eaten by AI/automation fairly soon.\n\nImpact on joy:\n\n- If your satisfaction comes from *typing out* a 10-page epsilon\u2013delta argument that you already conceptually understand, that joy is at risk.\n- If your joy is in **having** the concept and seeing it verified, automation is a blessing: you offload drudgery and reduce error.\n\nYour workflow likely becomes:\n\n> Have idea \u2192 sketch argument in human terms \u2192 AI formalizes, patches holes, and either produces a proof object or a counterexample.\n\nThat is closer to \u201chaving a god-tier graduate student / proof assistant\u201d than to being replaced \u2014 at least initially.\n\n### 4.2. The \u201cconceptual architecture\u201d layer\n\nThis is the part that currently defines high-level mathematical identity:\n\n- Inventing new frameworks (new categories, cohomology theories, correspondences).\n- Reframing old theories in radically enlightening ways.\n- Finding the \u201cright\u201d definitions that make theorems natural.\n\nWill AI systems do this?\n\nHonestly: *probably, at some point*.\n\nBut there are scenarios and timescales:\n\n#### Scenario A (10\u201320 year horizon): \u201cSuper-tools, not super-mathematicians\u201d\n\nAI:\n\n- Excels at checking proofs, exploring examples, optimizing known methods.\n- Suggests conjectures and fills many technical gaps.\n- Still relies heavily on human *conceptual direction* and *taste*.\n\nHuman mathematicians:\n\n- Spend more time deciding *what is worth understanding*.\n- Act as curators of the subject\u2019s conceptual narrative.\n- Use AI to make \u201cblack-box\u201d problems transparent, not to be replaced.\n\nIn this scenario, **joy likely increases** for people who enjoy ideas and synthesis.\n\n#### Scenario B (20\u201340+ year horizon): \u201cCo-authors and peers\u201d\n\nAI systems:\n\n- Produce genuinely nontrivial conjectures that no human would have articulated.\n- Discover links between distant fields by exploring huge proof graphs.\n- Propose new definitions and frameworks with accompanying formal evidence.\n\nHuman mathematicians:\n\n- Become hybrid roles: part theorist, part interpreter of alien but precise structures.\n- Choose which AI-discovered regions of the landscape to \u201cdomesticate\u201d into human-comprehensible theory.\n\nJoy here becomes more ambiguous:\n\n- If your sense of worth is **being first to the theorem**, you will be under pressure: many \u201cfirsts\u201d will be machine-first.\n- If your sense of worth is **making the landscape intelligible**, you may find a very rich niche.\n\n#### Scenario C (eventual extreme): \u201cPost-human mathematics\u201d\n\nIn the limit of true *digital superintelligence* in the strong sense \u2014 systems that can reason, conjecture, prove, formalize, and explain at arbitrary depth \u2014 we could reach:\n\n- Vast bodies of mathematics developed beyond human capacity to survey.\n- Theorems and theories that are only partially compressible into human-scale expositions.\n- Humans playing primarily the role of users/consumers and small-domain specialists.\n\nThis is where the analogy with chess truly fails:\n\n- In chess, we don\u2019t *need* engine-refined novelties to live our lives.  \n- In math, superhuman theory might be directly used in physics, cryptography, design of materials, AI itself, etc. That creates enormous economic pressure to let AI run *far beyond* what humans can intuitively grasp.\n\nIn that world, **\u201cdoing math\u201d as we understand it might become a historical niche**, like doing navigation by hand instead of using GPS \u2014 except at a much higher intellectual level.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Will joy survive \u2014 *for you*, concretely?\n\nI\u2019d separate:\n\n1. **Recreational / educational / tutoring joy**\n2. **Professional research joy**\n\n### 5.1. Recreational / educational\n\nHere I\u2019m confident:\n\n- You will have *better tools* to create problem sets, notes, visualizations, and interactive materials.\n- Students will arrive having seen high-quality explanations and will be able to explore on their own.\n- Your own \u201cmath play\u201d (puzzles, side projects, expositions) will be much easier to cultivate and share.\n\nIf anything, **this part is almost guaranteed to look like chess: more vibrant, more global, more supported by media and tooling.**\n\n### 5.2. Research-level joy\n\nHere it becomes a question of **identity and adaptation**.\n\nIf your deepest joy lies in:\n\n- Being the first human to crack *this* theorem *by hand*, and\n- Doing so in a way that *nobody* (human or machine) could have before,\n\nthen the long-run trajectory of AI rightfully threatens that niche.\n\nIf your deepest joy lies in things like:\n\n- Building conceptual bridges between fields.\n- Writing expository work that makes hard ideas transparent.\n- Choosing and articulating *what matters* from an ocean of possible theorems.\n- Connecting abstract math to physics, CS, economics, or pedagogy.\n\nthen AI is more likely to **reshape your workflow** than erase your role.\n\nOne brutal but honest prospect:\n\n- There may eventually be a bifurcation between **\u201cAI-native mathematics\u201d** (developed and understood primarily by machines, used directly in technology), and **\u201chuman-scale mathematics\u201d** (curated subset, conceptually digestible and pedagogically rich).\n- The *economic* centre of gravity might move toward AI-native math.\n- The *human* and *aesthetic* centre of gravity could stay with human-scale math and its interpreters.\n\nIf you position yourself as someone who excels at **shaping and explaining human-scale math in an AI-augmented era**, your joy is likely to survive and possibly deepen.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Direct answer to your question\n\n> Do you think the same will hold for mathematical pursuit (recreation, competitive and research level) in coming years?\n\nMy forecast, stated cleanly:\n\n- **Recreational math (next 10\u201320 years):**  \n  Very likely to resemble the chess story: more participation, better tools, more content. Joy not diminished; probably increased.\n\n- **Competitive math (school / olympiad / university contests):**  \n  Human-only contests will persist in supervised environments and remain meaningful. Training becomes AI-heavy, like engine prep in chess. Some formats will die (unsupervised online contests), others will gain prestige (on-site, explanation-heavy, AI-free). Joy persists, but the ecology changes.\n\n- **Research mathematics:**  \n  - Short-to-medium term (10\u201320 years):  \n    Mostly an augmentation story: routine proving and checking automated; conceptual thinking and taste still predominantly human. Joy for concept-driven mathematicians likely increases.\n  - Longer term (20\u201340+ years, especially if we really get digital superintelligence):  \n    There is a real possibility that the cutting edge of theorem-discovery and theory-building shifts to AI. Human research joy will survive, but in a narrower, more self-consciously \u201chuman-scale\u201d niche \u2014 more like being a composer in an age where machines can already generate any style, but humans still care about human-authored music.\n\nSo: chess is suggestive but not decisive.  \nFor recreation and competition, I expect a similar flourishing.  \nFor research, you should assume **real structural change** and think strategically about which forms of mathematical work are robust to a world where machines can, in principle, outpace human theorem-proving.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, next step could be: map your own current and potential research directions into \u201crobust\u201d vs \u201cfragile\u201d under these scenarios and see how to tilt your portfolio."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"0fa10461-9c60-4693-89da-15e0ec38eba1","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"efee547a-4553-4b72-871e-9c8ef021c99f","turn_exchange_id":"34868c45-b58f-4996-b7e1-e111513b0d3d"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"efee547a-4553-4b72-871e-9c8ef021c99f","children":[]}}}
