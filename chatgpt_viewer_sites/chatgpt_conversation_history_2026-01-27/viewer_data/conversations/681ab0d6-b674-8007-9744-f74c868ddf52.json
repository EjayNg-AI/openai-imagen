Mai 2025 griff Indien laut Verteidigungsministerium in Neu-Delhi mehrere Ziele in Pakistan an. Ziel der sogenannten \"Operation Sindoor\" waren angeblich terroristische Infrastrukturen, darunter Terrorcamps im pakistanisch kontrollierten Teil Kaschmirs sowie in der Provinz Punjab. Der Angriff war als Pr\u00e4zisionsschlag deklariert und betraf laut Indien keine pakistanischen Milit\u00e4reinrichtungen. Pakistan meldete acht Tote und 33 Verletzte, darunter Frauen und Kinder. Zudem habe Indien Moscheen getroffen, insbesondere in Bahwalpur. Pakistans Armee behauptet, zwei indische Kampfjets abgeschossen zu haben und k\u00fcndigte Vergeltung an. Der Luftraum wurde f\u00fcr 48 Stunden geschlossen. Die Spannungen versch\u00e4rfen sich nach einem Anschlag auf Hindu-Touristen am 22. April im indischen Teil Kaschmirs, bei dem Indien Pakistan Verantwortung vorwarf.

Islamabad says at least eight civilians died, claims to have shot down three Indian jets, and has closed its airspace to Indian traffic.

The LoC cease-fire of 2021 is effectively dead.  \n* **Medium-term:** Diplomatic back-channels (track-II) mediated by the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the US could revive the February 2021 cease-fire template if both sides secure domestic political cover after their respective summer budgets.  \n* **Long-term:** Without movement on Kashmir\u2019s political status or terrorism prosecutions, analysts foresee recurring cycles of violence. Water scarcity and climate stress will add a potent new layer of competition.  \n\n**Confidence-building measures still available:** restoring LoC hotline, re-opening trade for essential goods, expanding the Kartarpur model, resuming sporting ties, and jointly managing climate-driven glacier melt in the Himalayas.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line  \nThe 2025 flare-up has re-exposed how quickly the India-Pakistan rivalry can pivot from rhetorical hostility to missile exchanges, despite nominal cease-fires and pandemic-era lulls.  Absent credible third-party mediation and internal political will, the two nuclear neighbours remain locked in a volatile security dilemma where any terror incident\u2014or water dispute\u2014can again spiral toward open conflict, with ever-higher global stakes."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":1419,"end_idx":1438,"safe_urls":["https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Council

India blamed Pakistan for the assault, conducted a retaliatory operation named \u201cOperation Sindoor,\u201d and launched missile strikes on nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, claiming to target terrorist infrastructure. Pakistan denies these were militant sites and reported at least eight civilians dead and 35 injured in the attacks. In response, Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian airlines and claimed it shot down multiple Indian jets, though independent verification remains pending. Shelling continues across the Line of Control, causing casualties on both sides. Both nations have downgraded diplomatic ties and suspended trade and travel. The international community, including the UN, the US, and Iran, has urged restraint and called for de-escalation amid fears of conflict between these nuclear-armed neighbors. Indian stock markets and air travel have also been disrupted, and emergency measures have been declared in some Pakistani regions.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":89}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":4562,"end_idx":4594,"safe_urls":["https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/indias-water-will-flow-only-in-india-vows-pm-modi-amid-tensions-with-pakistan-over-suspension-of-indus-waters-treaty/articleshow/120937628.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-is-indus-waters-treaty-between-india-pakistan-2025-04-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-is-indus-waters-treaty-between-india-pakistan-2025-04-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/indias-water-will-flow-only-in-india-vows-pm-modi-amid-tensions-with-pakistan-over-suspension-of-indus-waters-treaty/articleshow/120937628.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"What is the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan?","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-is-indus-waters-treaty-between-india-pakistan-2025-04-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1745452800.0,"snippet":"The nuclear-armed neighbours disagree over use of the water from rivers that flow downstream from India into the Indus river basin in Pakistan.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"'India's water will flow only in India,' vows PM Modi amid tensions with Pakistan over suspension of Indus","url":"https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/indias-water-will-flow-only-in-india-vows-pm-modi-amid-tensions-with-pakistan-over-suspension-of-indus-waters-treaty/articleshow/120937628.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746547022.007319,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Economic Times"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":4809,"end_idx":4828,"safe_urls":["https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/kartarpur-corridor-open-visiting-gurdwara-pakistan-freeze-ties-9962721/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/kartarpur-corridor-open-visiting-gurdwara-pakistan-freeze-ties-9962721/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Kartarpur Corridor open for visiting gurdwara in Pakistan despite ...","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/kartarpur-corridor-open-visiting-gurdwara-pakistan-freeze-ties-9962721/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1745452800.0,"snippet":"Kartarpur Corridor open for visiting gurdwara in Pakistan despite freeze in ties | Chandigarh News -
