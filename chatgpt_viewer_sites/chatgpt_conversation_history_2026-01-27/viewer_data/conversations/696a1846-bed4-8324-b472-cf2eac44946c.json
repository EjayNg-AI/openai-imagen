Singh's conviction for lying to parliament. This unprecedented move came after a parliamentary vote declared Singh's conduct \"dishonourable and unbecoming,\" deeming him unsuitable for the role. Wong emphasized the importance of maintaining the rule of law and parliamentary integrity.\n\nAlthough the Leader of the Opposition role is not constitutionally mandated, it grants extra privileges, such as allowances, staff support, and access to confidential information. Wong has asked the Workers' Party to propose a replacement untainted by the scandal. Despite his removal from the post, Singh will remain a Member of Parliament and leader of the Workers' Party.\n\nThe conviction stems from Singh giving false testimony in 2021 regarding a former party member's fabricated parliamentary speech. Singh had become Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election. While political observers downplayed the practical impact of Singh\u2019s removal, the Workers\u2019 Party stated it will carefully consider Wong's request before responding.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1768467695.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-parliament-debate-removing-leader-opposition-after-lying-conviction-2026-01-14/","title":"Singapore parliament to debate removing Leader of the Opposition after lying conviction","snippet":"Singapore's Parliament is set to debate the removal of Pritam Singh from his role as Leader of the Opposition following his conviction for lying to Parliament. The motion, introduced by Leader of the House and People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) MP Indranee Rajah, cites Singh's \"dishonourable and unbecoming\" behavior as grounds for disqualification. Singh, who became Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election, was found guilty in 2025 of providing false testimony to a parliamentary committee in relation to a fellow Workers' Party member, Raeesah Khan. Although he received fines that allowed him to retain his parliamentary seat, an unsuccessful appeal resulted in Parliament now considering a response to his actions. Indranee stated that such behavior must not be tolerated in Singapore, emphasizing integrity in leadership. The conduct of Workers' Party leaders Sylvia Lim and Faisal Manap is also under scrutiny in connection to Singh\u2019s case. The ruling PAP continues its dominance in Parliament, having won 87 out of 97 seats in the 2025 general election.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1768376028.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/court-finds-singapore-opposition-party-leader-guilty-lying-parliament-2025-02-17/","title":"Singapore court finds opposition party leader guilty of lying to parliament","snippet":"On February 17, 2025, a Singapore court found Pritam Singh, the leader of the opposition Workers' Party, guilty of two counts of lying to a parliamentary committee. The charges relate to his 2021 testimony regarding fellow party member Raeesah Khan, who admitted to making false statements in parliament. Singh claimed he had advised Khan to come clean, but Judge Luke Tan cited substantial witness testimony contradicting Singh, including a remark suggesting the incident should be taken \"to the grave.\" Singh, who pleaded not guilty, faces a sentencing decision later the same day. A fine over S$10,000 or a jail term longer than one year would disqualify him from participating in the general election scheduled for later this year. This ruling arrives ahead of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong\u2019s first election since taking office and a day before he is due to deliver a national budget speech. The Workers' Party, despite making gains in the 2020 election, has since faced credibility issues due to internal scandals.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1739773512.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.channelnewsasia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wp-pritam-singh-parliament-leader-opposition-candidates-5861536","title":"WP 'better off' taking up PM Wong's invitation to name new ...","snippet":"23 hours ago \u2014 PM Wong removes Pritam Singh as Leader of the Opposition, invites Workers' Party to nominate another MP to fill the role ...

PM strips Singh of Leader of Opposition post","snippet":"On January 15, 2026, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong removed Pritam Singh from his position as Leader of the Opposition following Singh's conviction for lying to parliament. This unprecedented move came after a parliamentary vote declared Singh's conduct \"dishonourable and unbecoming,\" deeming him unsuitable for the role. Wong emphasized the importance of maintaining the rule of law and parliamentary integrity.\n\nAlthough the Leader of the Opposition role is not constitutionally mandated, it grants extra privileges, such as allowances, staff support, and access to confidential information. Wong has asked the Workers' Party to propose a replacement untainted by the scandal. Despite his removal from the post, Singh will remain a Member of Parliament and leader of the Workers' Party.\n\nThe conviction stems from Singh giving false testimony in 2021 regarding a former party member's fabricated parliamentary speech. Singh had become Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election. While political observers downplayed the practical impact of Singh\u2019s removal, the Workers\u2019 Party stated it will carefully consider Wong's request before responding.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1768467695.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-parliament-debate-removing-leader-opposition-after-lying-conviction-2026-01-14/","title":"Singapore parliament to debate removing Leader of the Opposition after lying conviction","snippet":"Singapore's Parliament is set to debate the removal of Pritam Singh from his role as Leader of the Opposition following his conviction for lying to Parliament. The motion, introduced by Leader of the House and People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) MP Indranee Rajah, cites Singh's \"dishonourable and unbecoming\" behavior as grounds for disqualification. Singh, who became Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election, was found guilty in 2025 of providing false testimony to a parliamentary committee in relation to a fellow Workers' Party member, Raeesah Khan. Although he received fines that allowed him to retain his parliamentary seat, an unsuccessful appeal resulted in Parliament now considering a response to his actions.

Singh's conviction for lying to parliament. This unprecedented move came after a parliamentary vote declared Singh's conduct \"dishonourable and unbecoming,\" deeming him unsuitable for the role. Wong emphasized the importance of maintaining the rule of law and parliamentary integrity.\n\nAlthough the Leader of the Opposition role is not constitutionally mandated, it grants extra privileges, such as allowances, staff support, and access to confidential information. Wong has asked the Workers' Party to propose a replacement untainted by the scandal. Despite his removal from the post, Singh will remain a Member of Parliament and leader of the Workers' Party.\n\nThe conviction stems from Singh giving false testimony in 2021 regarding a former party member's fabricated parliamentary speech. Singh had become Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election. While political observers downplayed the practical impact of Singh\u2019s removal, the Workers\u2019 Party stated it will carefully consider Wong's request before responding.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1768467695.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-parliament-debate-removing-leader-opposition-after-lying-conviction-2026-01-14/","title":"Singapore parliament to debate removing Leader of the Opposition after lying conviction","snippet":"Singapore's Parliament is set to debate the removal of Pritam Singh from his role as Leader of the Opposition following his conviction for lying to Parliament. The motion, introduced by Leader of the House and People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) MP Indranee Rajah, cites Singh's \"dishonourable and unbecoming\" behavior as grounds for disqualification. Singh, who became Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election, was found guilty in 2025 of providing false testimony to a parliamentary committee in relation to a fellow Workers' Party member, Raeesah Khan. Although he received fines that allowed him to retain his parliamentary seat, an unsuccessful appeal resulted in Parliament now considering a response to his actions. Indranee stated that such behavior must not be tolerated in Singapore, emphasizing integrity in leadership. The conduct of Workers' Party leaders Sylvia Lim and Faisal Manap is also under scrutiny in connection to Singh\u2019s case. The ruling PAP continues its dominance in Parliament, having won 87 out of 97 seats in the 2025 general election.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1768376028.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.channelnewsasia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wp-pritam-singh-parliament-leader-opposition-candidates-5861536","title":"WP

PM strips Singh of Leader of Opposition post","snippet":"On January 15, 2026, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong removed Pritam Singh from his position as Leader of the Opposition following Singh's conviction for lying to parliament. This unprecedented move came after a parliamentary vote declared Singh's conduct \"dishonourable and unbecoming,\" deeming him unsuitable for the role. Wong emphasized the importance of maintaining the rule of law and parliamentary integrity.\n\nAlthough the Leader of the Opposition role is not constitutionally mandated, it grants extra privileges, such as allowances, staff support, and access to confidential information. Wong has asked the Workers' Party to propose a replacement untainted by the scandal. Despite his removal from the post, Singh will remain a Member of Parliament and leader of the Workers' Party.\n\nThe conviction stems from Singh giving false testimony in 2021 regarding a former party member's fabricated parliamentary speech. Singh had become Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election. While political observers downplayed the practical impact of Singh\u2019s removal, the Workers\u2019 Party stated it will carefully consider Wong's request before responding.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1768467695.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-parliament-debate-removing-leader-opposition-after-lying-conviction-2026-01-14/","title":"Singapore parliament to debate removing Leader of the Opposition after lying conviction","snippet":"Singapore's Parliament is set to debate the removal of Pritam Singh from his role as Leader of the Opposition following his conviction for lying to Parliament. The motion, introduced by Leader of the House and People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) MP Indranee Rajah, cites Singh's \"dishonourable and unbecoming\" behavior as grounds for disqualification. Singh, who became Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election, was found guilty in 2025 of providing false testimony to a parliamentary committee in relation to a fellow Workers' Party member, Raeesah Khan. Although he received fines that allowed him to retain his parliamentary seat, an unsuccessful appeal resulted in Parliament now considering a response to his actions. Indranee stated that such behavior must not be tolerated in Singapore, emphasizing integrity in leadership. The conduct of Workers' Party leaders Sylvia Lim and Faisal Manap is also under scrutiny in connection to Singh\u2019s case. The ruling PAP continues its dominance in Parliament, having won 87 out of 97 seats in the 2025 general election.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1768376028.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.singaporelawwatch.sg","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/pritam-singh-removed-as-leader-of-the-opposition-with-immediate-effect","title":"Pritam Singh removed as Leader of the Opposition with immediate effect","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1768559400.0,"attribution":"www.singaporelawwatch.sg"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.linkedin.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pritam-singh-removed-leader-opposition-who-wp-nominate-j7l1c","title":"Pritam Singh removed as Leader of the Opposition.

Singh, who became Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election, was found guilty in 2025 of providing false testimony to a parliamentary committee in relation to a fellow Workers' Party member, Raeesah Khan. Although he received fines that allowed him to retain his parliamentary seat, an unsuccessful appeal resulted in Parliament now considering a response to his actions. Indranee stated that such behavior must not be tolerated in Singapore, emphasizing integrity in leadership. The conduct of Workers' Party leaders Sylvia Lim and Faisal Manap is also under scrutiny in connection to Singh\u2019s case.

The motion, introduced by Leader of the House and People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) MP Indranee Rajah, cites Singh's \"dishonourable and unbecoming\" behavior as grounds for disqualification. Singh, who became Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election, was found guilty in 2025 of providing false testimony to a parliamentary committee in relation to a fellow Workers' Party member, Raeesah Khan. Although he received fines that allowed him to retain his parliamentary seat, an unsuccessful appeal resulted in Parliament now considering a response to his actions. Indranee stated that such behavior must not be tolerated in Singapore, emphasizing integrity in leadership. The conduct of Workers' Party leaders Sylvia Lim and Faisal Manap is also under scrutiny in connection to Singh\u2019s case.

PM strips Singh of Leader of Opposition post","snippet":"On January 15, 2026, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong removed Pritam Singh from his position as Leader of the Opposition following Singh's conviction for lying to parliament. This unprecedented move came after a parliamentary vote declared Singh's conduct \"dishonourable and unbecoming,\" deeming him unsuitable for the role. Wong emphasized the importance of maintaining the rule of law and parliamentary integrity.\n\nAlthough the Leader of the Opposition role is not constitutionally mandated, it grants extra privileges, such as allowances, staff support, and access to confidential information. Wong has asked the Workers' Party to propose a replacement untainted by the scandal. Despite his removal from the post, Singh will remain a Member of Parliament and leader of the Workers' Party.\n\nThe conviction stems from Singh giving false testimony in 2021 regarding a former party member's fabricated parliamentary speech. Singh had become Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election. While political observers downplayed the practical impact of Singh\u2019s removal, the Workers\u2019 Party stated it will carefully consider Wong's request before responding.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1768467695.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reddit.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hzbaln/parliament_sets_out_duties_and_privileges_of/","title":"r/singapore - Parliament sets out duties and privileges of ...","snippet":"The former PH government gave the Leader of the Opposition an additional salary of around RM3,800 on top of the MP's allowance of 16,000 a month ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.reddit.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/100064630908028/posts/1318606353637049/","title":"Singapore government to review political office holders' salaries ...","snippet":"The fixed salary is $715,000 and the rest is variable...

parliament to debate removing Leader of the Opposition after lying conviction","snippet":"Singapore's Parliament is set to debate the removal of Pritam Singh from his role as Leader of the Opposition following his conviction for lying to Parliament. The motion, introduced by Leader of the House and People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) MP Indranee Rajah, cites Singh's \"dishonourable and unbecoming\" behavior as grounds for disqualification. Singh, who became Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election, was found guilty in 2025 of providing false testimony to a parliamentary committee in relation to a fellow Workers' Party member, Raeesah Khan. Although he received fines that allowed him to retain his parliamentary seat, an unsuccessful appeal resulted in Parliament now considering a response to his actions. Indranee stated that such behavior must not be tolerated in Singapore, emphasizing integrity in leadership. The conduct of Workers' Party leaders Sylvia Lim and Faisal Manap is also under scrutiny in connection to Singh\u2019s case. The ruling PAP continues its dominance in Parliament, having won 87 out of 97 seats in the 2025 general election.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1768376028.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-pm-removes-opposition-chief-post-local-media-reports-2026-01-15/","title":"Singapore PM strips Singh of Leader of Opposition post","snippet":"On January 15, 2026, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong removed Pritam Singh from his position as Leader of the Opposition following Singh's conviction for lying to parliament. This unprecedented move came after a parliamentary vote declared Singh's conduct \"dishonourable and unbecoming,\" deeming him unsuitable for the role. Wong emphasized the importance of maintaining the rule of law and parliamentary integrity.\n\nAlthough the Leader of the Opposition role is not constitutionally mandated, it grants extra privileges, such as allowances, staff support, and access to confidential information. Wong has asked the Workers' Party to propose a replacement untainted by the scandal. Despite his removal from the post, Singh will remain a Member of Parliament and leader of the Workers' Party.\n\nThe conviction stems from Singh giving false testimony in 2021 regarding a former party member's fabricated parliamentary speech. Singh had become Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election. While political observers downplayed the practical impact of Singh\u2019s removal, the Workers\u2019 Party stated it will carefully consider Wong's request before responding.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1768467695.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_%28Singapore%29","title":"Leader of the Opposition (Singapore)","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes/posts/this-includes-the-salaries-of-all-members-of-the-house-including-mps-and-nmps/1179164011037424/","title":"This includes the salaries of all members of the House ...","snippet":"Here is the breakdown (categories & allowances): \u2014Gross salary: Sh725,500 \u2014Mileage allowance (NEW): Sh366,000 \u2014Car maintenance allowance: Sh356, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.facebook.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/MothershipSG/posts/the-leader-of-the-opposition-is-a-parliamentary-leadership-position-carrying-imp/1341262604709171/","title":"The Leader of the Opposition is a \"parliamentary ...","snippet":"The Leader of the Opposition is a \"parliamentary leadership position carrying important responsibilities, duties and privileges\", the motion ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.facebook.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"sg.news.yahoo.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/parliament-debate-pritam-suitability-leader-020644936.html","title":"Parliament to debate Pritam's suitability as Leader of the ...","snippet":"8 Jan 2026 \u2014 Mr Pritam Singh was convicted on Feb 17, 2025, and fined the maximum of $7,000 for each of the charges.

This unprecedented move came after a parliamentary vote declared Singh's conduct \"dishonourable and unbecoming,\" deeming him unsuitable for the role. Wong emphasized the importance of maintaining the rule of law and parliamentary integrity.\n\nAlthough the Leader of the Opposition role is not constitutionally mandated, it grants extra privileges, such as allowances, staff support, and access to confidential information. Wong has asked the Workers' Party to propose a replacement untainted by the scandal. Despite his removal from the post, Singh will remain a Member of Parliament and leader of the Workers' Party.\n\nThe conviction stems from Singh giving false testimony in 2021 regarding a former party member's fabricated parliamentary speech. Singh had become Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election. While political observers downplayed the practical impact of Singh\u2019s removal, the Workers\u2019 Party stated it will carefully consider Wong's request before responding.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"CNA"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search23\ue201","start_idx":1210,"end_idx":1230,"safe_urls":["https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-pritam-singh-leader-opposition-5108951","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-pritam-singh-leader-opposition-5108951?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-pritam-singh-leader-opposition-5108951?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh to continue as Leader of ...","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-pritam-singh-leader-opposition-5108951?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"5 May 2025 \u2014 The Leader of the Opposition receives double the allowance of an elected MP - at about S$385,000 (US$298,000) annually.

PM strips Singh of Leader of Opposition post","snippet":"On January 15, 2026, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong removed Pritam Singh from his position as Leader of the Opposition following Singh's conviction for lying to parliament. This unprecedented move came after a parliamentary vote declared Singh's conduct \"dishonourable and unbecoming,\" deeming him unsuitable for the role. Wong emphasized the importance of maintaining the rule of law and parliamentary integrity.\n\nAlthough the Leader of the Opposition role is not constitutionally mandated, it grants extra privileges, such as allowances, staff support, and access to confidential information. Wong has asked the Workers' Party to propose a replacement untainted by the scandal. Despite his removal from the post, Singh will remain a Member of Parliament and leader of the Workers' Party.\n\nThe conviction stems from Singh giving false testimony in 2021 regarding a former party member's fabricated parliamentary speech. Singh had become Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election. While political observers downplayed the practical impact of Singh\u2019s removal, the Workers\u2019 Party stated it will carefully consider Wong's request before responding.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1768467695.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-parliament-debate-removing-leader-opposition-after-lying-conviction-2026-01-14/","title":"Singapore parliament to debate removing Leader of the Opposition after lying conviction","snippet":"Singapore's Parliament is set to debate the removal of Pritam Singh from his role as Leader of the Opposition following his conviction for lying to Parliament. The motion, introduced by Leader of the House and People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) MP Indranee Rajah, cites Singh's \"dishonourable and unbecoming\" behavior as grounds for disqualification. Singh, who became Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 general election, was found guilty in 2025 of providing false testimony to a parliamentary committee in relation to a fellow Workers' Party member, Raeesah Khan. Although he received fines that allowed him to retain his parliamentary seat, an unsuccessful appeal resulted in Parliament now considering a response to his actions. Indranee stated that such behavior must not be tolerated in Singapore, emphasizing integrity in leadership. The conduct of Workers' Party leaders Sylvia Lim and Faisal Manap is also under scrutiny in connection to Singh\u2019s case. The ruling PAP continues its dominance in Parliament, having won 87 out of 97 seats in the 2025 general election.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1768376028.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1181221740831651&set=a.565198952433936&type=3","title":"The Straits - BREAKING: PM Lawrence Wong ... - Facebook","snippet":"BREAKING: PM Lawrence Wong has removed WP chief Pritam Singh as Leader of the Opposition.
