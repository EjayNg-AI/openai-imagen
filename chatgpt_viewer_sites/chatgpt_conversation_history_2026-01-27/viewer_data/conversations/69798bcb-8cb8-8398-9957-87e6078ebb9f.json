I need to gather the listings, ensuring the information fits the regulations for private tuition, like any legal requirements, such as URA approval or licensing. I\u2019ll also make sure not to share personal data.\n\n**Compiling comprehensive list of rental units**\n\nThe user asked for a detailed list of available HDB shophouses and commercial units for rent. I should gather data from multiple sources like PropertyGuru, 99.co, SRX, EdgeProp, and HDB\u2019s commercial property listings. Since some may only be available through HDB tenders, I'll compile these sources into a comprehensive list and present it, maybe in a markdown table.\n\n**Finding rental units near MRT stations and compliance details**\n\nTo meet the user's request, I\u2019ll use web listings to find units in Hougang, Serangoon, Kovan, and Lorong Ah Soo with a rental budget under $3500. I need to ensure the units are close to MRT stations. I can rely on descriptions mentioning \"near MRT\" for a rough estimate. Also, it's important to note the private tuition registration requirements.\n\n**Confirming MOE registration requirements and rental listings**\n\nThe user wants to ensure the private tuition center stays under the registration threshold, but I\u2019m not certain where the MOE stands on tuition centers with fewer than 10 students. I\u2019ll need to confirm the current guidelines. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll focus on compiling a list of available rental units that meet the user\u2019s criteria.\n\n**Presenting rental unit listings and including citations**\n\nThe user asked for a comprehensive list of rental units near MRT stations. I\u2019ll organize the listings in a table with details like address, property type, rent, and suitability for tuition centers. Images may not be necessary, but I\u2019ll focus on the core information and ensure I provide citations for each listing.\n\n**Compiling HDB shophouse and commercial unit listings**\n\nI\u2019ll compile listings of HDB shophouses and commercial units specifically under $3,500. Some units may require \"change of use\" for tuition, and others may have restrictions based on building management or trade usage. I\u2019ll include only those that meet these requirements and clarify where necessary. Citations will be included in table cells, not inside bold or italics.\n\n**Compiling rental listings with citations**\n\nI'll search for rental listings in Hougang, Kovan, Serangoon, and Lorong Ah Soo under $3,500. Property listings can change quickly, so I\u2019ll make sure to note the date (\"as of 28 Jan 2026\") and provide citations from the sources. I\u2019ll compile results from major real estate portals and attempt multiple searches.\n\n**Checking listings for HDB shophouses and commercial units**\n\nI found office listings near Kovan and Hougang, with one possibly in an HDB estate, but it's listed as an office. There's another private commercial development, The Promenade at Pelikat, which could be suitable for tuition and meets the user's request for commercial units. I'll need to confirm the HDB classification.\n\n**Refining listings based on walking time and price**\n\nThe Promenade @ Pelikat is within 10 minutes from Kovan MRT, and the price is within the budget, so it's a valid option. An office at Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre is close but too far with a 12-min walk. The industrial unit at Serangoon North isn't viable since it\u2019s 11 minutes away \u2014 I'll exclude it based on the strict 10-minute requirement. I'll focus on gathering listings within Hougang, Serangoon, Lorong Ah Soo, and Kovan areas.\n\n**Refining search strategy based on user needs**\n\nThe listings from CommercialGuru show offices like The Promenade and Da Jin Factory, but they're too far from the MRT. It seems I need to consider other sources like PropertyGuru, 99.co, and SRX for available units around Hougang and Serangoon. Though these spaces near MRT stations have higher rents, focusing on small offices in industrial buildings could help meet the user\u2019s needs while sticking to the budget. I\u2019ll aim to compile the best options, including possibly HDB tenders!\n\n**Considering HDB tenders within the rental limit**\n\nHDB shops are allocated via tenders, which means rent isn't fixed and may be above the 3500 limit. We can list the active tenders with location and estimated rent if it's within budget, but there's no guarantee. I'll also check out HDB\u2019s e-service or search for relevant tenders to see what fits.\n\n**Reviewing and listing HDB Place2Lease and other properties**\n\nI found HDB Place2Lease e-bid details, where starting bids for commercial units could be included if under 3500, but the final rent could be higher. I\u2019ll note that cautionary detail, and filter the units by Hougang, Serangoon, etc. I'll also include listings from other sources like CommercialGuru, making sure they're within the 10-minute MRT walk and rent requirement.\n\n**Reviewing available commercial spaces**\n\nFrom the web results, here\u2019s a list of potential commercial spaces:\n\n- A 677 sqft office in Kovan for $3500/mo.\n- An 850 sqft office for $3400/mo in Hougang.\n- A 312 sqft unit in The Promenade @ Pelikat for $2000/mo.\n- A 333 sqft space in The Promenade for $2500/mo.\n\nBoth The Promenade listings are about 10 minutes from Kovan MRT. I\u2019ll open the listing pages for details.\n\n**Reviewing additional listings**\n\nHere are some more available commercial spaces:\n\n- A 183 sqft mall shop in The Promenade @ Pelikat (9 mins from Kovan MRT), but needs details on rent, could be under $3500.\n- A large 1604 sqft shop in Kovan at $17,999/mo, which exceeds the budget, so we\u2019ll exclude that.\n- A 300 sqft shop at The Midtown on Upper Serangoon Road for $3300/mo, within the rent limit and 4 minutes from Hougang MRT.\n\n**Searching on more potential listings**\n\nThe shop near The Midtown near Hougang MRT qualifies with a rent under $3500, so I\u2019ll include that. \n\nI\u2019ll search for more properties near Hougang MRT, as well as possible listings around Serangoon and Kovan MRT. \n\nFor Bartley area, I\u2019ll check for office spaces and any industrial options near Lorong Ah Soo, aiming for those within a 10-minute walk from the MRT.\n\n**Clarifying MRT station details for filtering**\n\nThere's confusion about the upcoming Cross Island Line (CR9), which isn\u2019t open yet. I should avoid including listings that reference it and focus on stations that are currently operating. I'll filter for units around existing MRT stations like Kovan, Hougang, Serangoon, and possibly Bartley, as the user requested those areas.\n\n**Refining search for appropriate properties**\n\nI'll group properties by MRT stations: Kovan, Hougang, Serangoon, and possibly Bartley. We'll focus on those within 10 minutes walking distance of an MRT station, as requested. I'll exclude listings that don't meet that and sort by property type\u2014focusing on commercial units like HDB shophouses rather than industrial offices, as education use might be restricted. I'll explore more through CommercialGuru filters.\n\n**Refining property search criteria**\n\nWe only need properties under 3500 and within 10 minutes of an MRT station. The page may have lots of listings, but most will be above the price threshold. I'll try filtering by maxPrice=3500 and specifying the station in the search query to find the most relevant results.\n\n**Narrowing down listings by area and price**\n\nI found some listings on CommercialGuru under 3.5k, including options near Kovan MRT like The Promenade. One is 810 meters from Kovan for S$1,500, with others at similar prices. A promising listing is at Riverfront Residences, a commercial space near Hougang MRT for S$1,790. I'll focus on these within the target areas.\n\n**Identifying options in Hougang area**\n\nI found some interesting listings near Hougang and Buangkok MRT. For example, there's a 527 sqft shop in Hougang Green Shopping Mall for S$3,000/mo, and another at 335 Hougang Avenue 7 for S$2,000/mo. The Promenade @ Pelikat has a range of shops too. I'll focus on possibilities that meet the 10-minute walking requirement.\n\n**Clarifying listings near Kovan and Serangoon MRT**\n\nFor Kovan, I\u2019m considering The Promenade options, but some listings like the 290 sqft one don\u2019t show rent\u2014it\u2019s worth checking. For Serangoon, listings like Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre are within 1 km of Kovan but about 1.8 km from Serangoon MRT. I\u2019ll need to open and extract further information to be sure.\n\n**Focusing on Serangoon and nearby options**\n\nThe user is looking for units near both Serangoon and Serangoon North, with a budget under 3,500. While Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre is closer to Kovan than Serangoon MRT, places like the \"Da Jin Factory Building\" or small kiosks around NEX may not fit. I\u2019ll also target Lorong Ah Soo and Hougang Green Shopping Mall, ensuring all are commercial units.\n\n**Targeting units near key MRTs under 3500**\n\nI need to search for shop/office listings under 3500 SGD, focusing on units near key MRTs: Kovan (NE13), Hougang (NE14), Serangoon (CC13/NE12), Buangkok (NE15), Woodleigh (near Lorong Ah Soo), Bartley (CC12), and Serangoon Gardens. This should help pinpoint all relevant options within the budget.\n\n**Evaluating industrial units near Bartley MRT**\n\nSearch results show a B1 industrial unit at Morningstar Centre, 700 sqft, for 2,600/mo, which is 10 minutes from Bartley MRT and within the target rent, but it may not be suitable for tuition. I'll check the permitted use and consider it an option. Other industrial units, like KIN Building and Da Jin Factory, are outside the preferred range.\n\n**Exploring options near Bartley MRT**\n\nI'm considering tuition-friendly spaces like a 140 sqft unit at Kensington Square for 1,700/mo, just 9 minutes from Bartley MRT. It\u2019s a mall with small shops, which might allow \"Education\" use, but I need to confirm. The 258 sqft unit there is also a possibility, depending on the rent. I\u2019ll collect relevant listings.\n\n**Gathering comprehensive listings from key sources**\n\nI\u2019ll gather property data from CommercialGuru, 99.co, and possibly PropertyGuru. The goal is to systematically search based on specific filters, like price \u2264 3500 and property types such as shops or offices, near Kovan MRT. I\u2019ll need to explore all listings and not just the snippet previews.\n\n**Searching for relevant commercial properties and units**\n\nI\u2019ll search 99.co for commercial properties near Kovan and Hougang MRT with a price filter of \u2264 3500. PropertyGuru may list mall shops like The Midtown, but login might be needed. SRX listings for Hougang Avenue 1 could work, though we need to confirm MRT distance. HDB listings via Place2Lease could also be considered, but confirming legality for tuition usage is tricky.\n\n**Clarifying tuition centre regulations and property suitability**\n\nI\u2019ll categorize units into HDB shop/shophouse, small retail (private developments/malls), and office units (including B1 industrial). I\u2019ll note that suitability depends on approved use, focusing on properties that allow tuition or enrichment. Many listings mention allowed uses. I also need to clarify MOE registration rules and URA guidelines for tuition centres.\n\n**Clarifying MOE registration for tuition centres**\n\nI've found that tuition centres offering education to 10 or more students must register with MOE under the Education Act. The key point seems to be that it's based on the number of students being taught at any time, not just per class. So, if your total is 10 or more students, MOE registration is required. I'll explain this to the user for clarity.\n\n**Clarifying HDB trade rules and regulations compliance**\n\nHDB allows tuition centres as a type of commercial trade, but a change of use from shop to \"commercial school\" might be required. It's important to remind the user to comply with regulations. They want to keep under the 10-student threshold to avoid registration, which is fine, but we must be careful not to encourage evasion. I'll provide info on the requirements and encourage them to always stay compliant. The main focus now is providing a list of suitable units.\n\n**Compiling a list of available properties**\n\nTo compile a comprehensive list of available properties, I will gather details on the rental units currently advertised at Kovan. This will include rent, floor area, property type, address, and walking distance to MRT. Since property listings tend to change frequently, I\u2019ll specify that this list is current as of Jan 28, 2026. I'll gather these details by reviewing individual listings from relevant sources. Let's open the necessary pages and extract the required information.\n\n**Accessing unit details and limitations**\n\nIt seems that the unit details from the HDB Place2Lease website didn\u2019t load properly, possibly due to JavaScript restrictions. I\u2019ll rely on the snippet from the search results that provides key details like the floor area and starting bid. Although I would prefer using the full listing, the snippet still gives a clear picture. Regarding other listings, I\u2019ll continue with the available units from CommercialGuru and 99.co, as their details are accessible.\n\n**Locating rent details in page listings**\n\nFor the Hougang Green Shopping Mall listing on 99.co, I noticed the rent wasn\u2019t immediately visible for the 527 sqft unit. I\u2019ll check the page further, as the search snippet showed a rent of S$ 3,000/mo. I\u2019ll search the open page for this value to find the exact spot.\n\n**Clarifying The Midtown listing details**\n\nThe 99.co page titled \"The Midtown\" seems to list multiple properties across different regions, rather than focusing only on the Midtown itself. I\u2019ll need to sift through these listings and pay attention to the matching criteria. I\u2019ll start by checking lines between L480 and L540 to look for the relevant information, like the S$3,000/mo listing.\n\n**Clarifying listings and narrowing focus**\n\nThe listing for 684 Hougang Avenue 8 is at S$9,500/month, so it's not relevant to our interest. There's some confusion with listings labeled under \"Hougang Avenue 4\" or Avenue 8. However, we\u2019ll focus on finding listings under S$3,500, like The Promenade @ Pelikat retail shop at S$1,500/month, potentially an office in a loft style. I\u2019ll gather more details on those relevant listings.\n\n**Identifying relevant listings**\n\nThe \"Other Retail for Rent in The Promenade @ Pelikat\" at 205 sqft for S$1,500/mo is a good match. I'll also include listings from CommercialGuru within a 10-minute walk from Kovan MRT. We should also track down 335 Hougang Avenue 7, 200 sqft for S$2,000/mo, near line 1200 in the page. I'll search for it.\n\n**Locating rent details**\n\nThe search results show the listing for \"335 Hougang Avenue 7,\" but I don't see the rent details. I'll check the lines around 1388 to 1405 to find rent information. This might give us the full details we need to assess the listing.\n\n**Clarifying the rent for 335 Hougang Avenue 7**\n\nThe rent listed as \"S$ 1,500/mo\" appears right after the \"335 Hougang Avenue 7\" listing, but it's unclear if it's for that specific listing or another. Based on the area and PSF, it seems to align with 335 Hougang Avenue 7, but the earlier mention said \"S$ 2,000/mo.\" We need to double-check this.\n\n**Identifying rent price confusion with listings**\n\nIt looks like the \"S$ 1,500\" rent line is for \"335 Hougang Avenue 7,\" not \"S$ 2,000.\" The 1,500 listing seems to appear right after that address, which makes sense since the price displays after the listing's info. The Promenade, however, does also show 1,500 later, creating some confusion.\n\n**Clarifying rent details for Hougang Avenue 7**\n\nThe S$ 2,000 rent belongs to the Heartland Mall office, confirmed by its listing between lines 1394 and 1395. For 335 Hougang Avenue 7, the rent of S$1,500 appears at lines 1439-1440, which seems accurate. The previous snippet showing S$2,000 might be from another page or outdated info. Let\u2019s confirm by checking earlier lines.\n\n**Confirming prices and capturing details**\n\nThe exact rent for 335 Hougang Avenue 7 is confirmed as S$1,500/mo, based on open lines. I'll cite that. But we also need the price for the 'Hougang Green Shopping Mall' listing with 527 sqft, which might be S$3,000/mo. I'll check the listing around lines 880-940 for confirmation.\n\n**Refining Hougang Green listings to exclude above-limit options**\n\nI found that the 527 sqft listing at Hougang Green Shopping Mall shows a rent of S$8,888, not S$3,000. So, I\u2019ll exclude this. I could search for other listings with a price below S$3,500, but it seems none show up. A more targeted approach would be to search directly using filters on 99.co.\n\n**Sorting 99.co listings by price and details**\n\nThe 99.co page is a bit messy, so I\u2019ll look at each listing's price separately. First, for Heartland Mall Office (550 sqft), priced at S$2,000/mo, seems good but I need to confirm if it\u2019s private. Next, the 335 Hougang Avenue 7 listing with 200 sqft, priced at S$1,500/mo is clear. I\u2019ll check The Promenade for its price.\n\n**Identifying price inconsistencies on 99.co**\n\nThe Promenade listing showing S$90,000/mo seems like a glitch\u2014it\u2019s very unrealistic for 205 sqft. This suggests possible issues with the 99.co page, as some listings don\u2019t seem properly filtered. Given the confusion, I'll focus on individual listings rather than the entire page, but I\u2019ll aim to sort out accurate info.\n\n**Refining approach for rental listings under 3,500**\n\nThe user wants a comprehensive list of units available for rent under S$3,500. I\u2019ll focus on more reliable sources like CommercialGuru and PropertyGuru, ensuring I confirm each listing individually to avoid unwanted outliers. I\u2019ll use filters for locations near Kovan, Hougang, Serangoon, and Bartley, sorting by price. Time to start gathering accurate details!\n\n**Checking distances between locations for rental listings**\n\nThe Serangoon MRT page shows 10 retail listings, but their distances are mostly above the 10-minute requirement (like 11 minutes and 900 meters). I'll only include those within 9 minutes or 780 meters. Some appear to be near Space @ Kovan, but it\u2019s important to verify these closeness assumptions to Serangoon.\n\n**Finalizing qualifying listings near Serangoon MRT**\n\nThe 780-meter listings near Serangoon could be between Kovan and Serangoon; given that Kovan to Serangoon is 1.2 km, this distance for Space @ Kovan (9 minutes) and Highland Centre (10 minutes) qualify. Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre (11 minutes) exceeds the limit, so I\u2019ll exclude it to stay within the max 10-minute requirement.\n\n**Reviewing listings near Kovan, Serangoon, and Hougang**\n\nFrom the listings, we have suitable units:\n\n- Highland Centre 388 sqft at $1,850/month (10 minutes from Serangoon).\n- Space @ Kovan has several units under $3,500. All are 9 minutes (780m) to Serangoon station.\n- Rare Office Space in Hougang Street 21, 677 sqft at $3,500, 5 minutes from Kovan MRT.\n\nNow, I just need to check if HDB shophouse options appear.\n\n**Reviewing shop and office space options near Kovan**\n\nI found several options:\n\n- Modern office space at Hougang Street 21, 850 sqft, $3,400.\n- The Promenade @ Pelikat offers multiple units, like 333 sqft at $2,500 and others around $1,950-$2,000.\n- I plan to filter The Promenade listings near Kovan using a price limit of $3,500 to find more relevant options.\n\n**Refining search for The Promenade options**\n\nI found relevant listings from The Promenade @ Pelikat, with rents ranging from $1,200 to $2,200. The results are interesting, though strangely linked to a Paya Lebar school search. I\u2019ll focus on extracting all the listings under $3,500 that are within 10 minutes of Kovan MRT, starting from line 344.\n\n**Managing resource limits while compiling listings**\n\nAlright, considering the tool limits, we can likely assemble the list without too many additional searches. While specific data for Hougang and Kovan MRT under $3,500 would be helpful, we\u2019ve got a solid collection of results from sources like CommercialGuru and 99.co. Kovan MRT area has several units like The Promenade @ Pelikat, indicating reliable options. We can make this work with the available information!\n\n**Confirming office listings with limited calls**\n\nWe might find office spaces around Hougang Street 21 with rents near $3,500 and just 5 minutes from Kovan MRT. I could open the CommercialGuru pages for details, but we need to use our remaining calls wisely. Since one tool call can open multiple pages, this seems like the best option!\n\n**Confirming additional properties and details**\n\nTo confirm details, I\u2019ll use one web call to open the listings for offices (including CommercialGuru and Midtown). One snippet from PropertyGuru was enough for The Midtown, but we might want to verify. Additionally, 99.co provided details for a Hougang Avenue 7 HDB shop and Riverfront Residences, but I haven\u2019t completely confirmed the latter\u2019s specifics yet.\n\n**Compiling Riverfront and Bartley listings**\n\nI haven\u2019t located the exact price for the Riverfront Residences listing yet, but we can look into the search results for the correct details, which seem to show S$1,790. For the Bartley area, I\u2019ll include Kensington Square listings at 140 sqft for S$1,700 and 258 sqft for S$2,300 as well.\n\n**Compiling comprehensive listings and deduplication**\n\nI've found multiple options like the Morningstar Centre 700 sqft for S$2,600 and Spazio @ Kovan 753 sqft for S$3,400, both near Bartley. There are also several listings for \"Space @ Kovan\" and Vibes @ Kovan. I\u2019ll deduplicate listings by location, size, and rent and include all unique entries.\n\n**Listing unique units and refining search criteria**\n\nTo avoid duplicates, I'll list unique units by building and range of rents/sizes. However, I'll still ensure the approach is comprehensive as requested. Given time and tool limitations, I'll compile available units from key sources and provide links for further searches. I\u2019ll focus on those near Hougang MRT and within price limits.\n\n**Finalizing listings with available sources**\n\nSince we have just one tool call left, I'll focus on the sources gathered so far. I'll include listings like Heartland Mall-Kovan, with flagged uncertainty regarding price, and Spazio @ Kovan, priced under the budget. I\u2019ll need to check usage permissions for the medical unit, which might limit its options for the user's needs.\n\n**Clarifying property types and rental suitability**\n\nSince the user is looking for units suited to tuition, medical properties likely aren't a good fit. However, the listing might still be included with a note that it could require a change of use. I'll also consider adding additional office listings from the CommercialGuru and 99.co pages, focusing on relevant options.\n\n**Compiling rental listings with filters and details**\n\nTo meet the user's request, I'll compile a list of units with clear details on rent, size, and distance (within 10 minutes). Since I can't list everything, I'll include useful filters and \"where to keep watching\" URLs for further searches, noting any potential additional charges like maintenance or GST.\n\n**Categorizing the units based on property types**\n\nSome of the units are in private malls, which is fine, but I should also consider whether some might be \"HDB shophouses.\" For example, 335 Hougang Avenue 7 looks like it could be one. I\u2019ll label it as \"HDB shophouse/retail (HDB estate)\" where the classification is clearer.\n\n**Providing steps for verifying tuition suitability**\n\nTo see if a unit can be used for tuition, I should check the URA zoning and approved use via their platform and e-Services. For HDB shophouses, I\u2019ll verify allowed trades through HDB and check other legal requirements like MOE registration when offering education. Public and private tuition has different requirements and must be clarified. I'll also keep in mind the new cross island line.\n\n**Compiling rental units from sources**\n\nI\u2019ve found a few listings to include for rental units: \n\n- Kovan, Hougang Street 21, 677 sqft for $3,500 (5 min to NE13 Kovan)\n- 208 Hougang Street 21, 850 sqft for $3,400 (5 min to Kovan)\n- The Promenade @ Pelikat listings: ranging from 205 sqft at $1,200 to 388 sqft at $2,388 (10 min to Kovan)\n\nI\u2019ll cite the sources for these listings, but it seems the price may not always be explicitly shown in the search snippet.\n\n**Additional units found for inclusion**\n\nHere are more listings to include:\n\n- The Promenade @ Pelikat: 312 sqft for $2,000 (10 min to Kovan)\n- Ground-floor The Promenade listing: 333 sqft at $2,500 (1 Apr availability)\n- Vibes @ Kovan: 291 sqft at $2,400 (10 min to Serangoon)\n- Kensington Square: 258 sqft at $2,300 (9 min to Bartley)\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to cite the sources for these listings, similar to prior ones.\n\n**Clarifying Hougang and Serangoon listings**\n\nHere\u2019s what I gathered for Hougang and the surrounding area:\n\n- The Midtown 300 sqft at $3,300, 4 min to Hougang MRT, listed Jan 22.\n- A smaller unit at 335 Hougang Avenue (200 sqft) listed at $1,500.\n- Heartland Mall office (550 sqft) near Kovan MRT at $2,000.\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to cite these as appropriate. The duplicates will be cleaned up, using the most recent listings.\n\n**Focusing on Hougang, Bartley, and other retail options**\n\nFor Hougang, there might be other shops under $3500, but we haven't identified them yet. We can propose what's available now. Bartley areas like Kensington Square and Morningstar Centre include office rentals, with prices and details confirmed. I'll also verify tags and property types for accurate educational center suitability.\n\n**Clarifying compliance and gathering listing info**\n\nI'll start by emphasizing compliance: the threshold for MOE registration and land-use approvals for tuition centers are crucial, so the user avoids trouble. I'll also gather 20 listings based on the user's rent and time criteria. The listings will be organized by MRT station/area for clarity and convenience.\n\n**Finalizing listings and providing key details**\n\nI\u2019ll check through the listings for compliance with rent and MRT access criteria. Disclaimers will highlight walking distances, GST exclusions, and the importance of verifying details on maps. I\u2019ll also clarify regulatory checks and provide sources, but no raw URLs. I\u2019ll give a step-by-step guide for MOE registration and business compliance. Additionally, I\u2019ll make sure to mention HDB trade restrictions and necessary approvals for tuition centers.\n\n**Providing final listings and disclaimers**\n\nI\u2019ll list the available properties according to the user\u2019s constraints: asking rent \u2264 S$3,500 and within a 10-minute walk from an MRT station. For each property, I'll include details including location, size, price, and proximity to MRT. I'll also provide citations for each listing source. Additionally, I\u2019ll remind the user that this is a snapshot of the listings as of January 28, 2026 and that prices and availability may change. I'll include compliance notes and encourage the user to look for any additional information on the official listing pages.\n\n**Final answer and disclaimer**\n\nI'll provide listings based on the desired criteria: commercial units for rent in Hougang, Serangoon, Lorong Ah Soo, and Kovan, excluding units outside the budget or those with uncertain details like Carousell or Facebook listings. I\u2019ll also clarify the user\u2019s need for private tuition spaces: <10 students ensures they avoid needing MOE registration, though changes to building usage or approvals might still apply per URA. Citations will be included, ensuring clarity."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 29m 15s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-westus3-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-a4bd6f6d-f9b4-4954-9e37-13e9e8d3c781:US","parent_id":"ef804679-4204-4421-873d-d300ead0a99e","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_69798bccaa1c81919bbe30bf4abb0e7f","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"69798bcc-ab28-8399-84c0-0f2225a6efd9","async_task_created_at":"2026-01-28T04:08:44.925984Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"ef804679-4204-4421-873d-d300ead0a99e","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"a4bd6f6d-f9b4-4954-9e37-13e9e8d3c781","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"44801f20-ad94-43a7-873c-23c5fed05104","finished_duration_sec":1755,"pro_skipped":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ef804679-4204-4421-873d-d300ead0a99e","children":["90896e79-ae6e-43b0-bebf-63349abe0f82"]},"90896e79-ae6e-43b0-bebf-63349abe0f82":{"id":"90896e79-ae6e-43b0-bebf-63349abe0f82","message":{"id":"90896e79-ae6e-43b0-bebf-63349abe0f82","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769573551.004,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["ls"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":["EjayNg-AI/agentic_browser"],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"84b23059-6d71-41d7-8b99-25686675bad7","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"3228a070-5d0a-4e14-95ab-514896561988"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bda85244-29fa-44de-b38e-e4596fa06be9","children":["234fa539-dc8d-4e04-9c51-d2fbbecf467f"]},"234fa539-dc8d-4e04-9c51-d2fbbecf467f":{"id":"234fa539-dc8d-4e04-9c51-d2fbbecf467f","message":{"id":"234fa539-dc8d-4e04-9c51-d2fbbecf467f","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1769573552.105157,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\n\n**Compiling rental listings for private tuition spaces**\n\nThe user wants a detailed list of HDB shophouses and commercial units for rent in specific Singapore locations \u2014 Hougang, Serangoon, Lorong Ah Soo, Kovan \u2014 with a budget limit and distance to MRT stations. I need to filter available listings by price and make sure the details comply with MOE regulations for tuition. I'll gather the most up-to-date rental data.\n\n**Compiling accurate rental listings**\n\nProperty portals may block access or have dynamic listings, but I'll still try to retrieve the data. I\u2019ll approximate walking distances based on listing details like \"0.4 km to Kovan MRT.\" I\u2019ll compile a comprehensive list by checking \"HDB shophouse for rent tuition in Hougang\" and similar searches. I\u2019ll ensure the units allow tuition.\n\n**Clarifying requirements for tuition space rentals**\n\nThe user is asking for HDB shophouses and commercial units where small-scale tuition (under 10 students) is allowed. I need to clarify that tuition centers might need registration with the Committee for Private Education if they go beyond this limit. I\u2019ll research the MOE and CPE rules for proper guidance.\n\n**Ensuring compliance and providing accurate rental details**\n\nI need to be careful since the user wants to avoid crossing the student threshold for MOE registration, but that isn\u2019t illicit as long as it complies with regulations. I\u2019ll provide rental listings that meet their criteria, but I\u2019ll also remind them to verify regulatory compliance. I'll include estimates for walking times, distances, rental prices, and suitability features in a table format.\n\n**Defining search criteria for tuition space rentals**\n\nThe user asks for a comprehensive list of rental units, balancing exact location and regulations. I\u2019ll focus on properties near specified MRT stations, making sure they fit the tuition-use requirement. I'll include properties with \"education center\" approval from URA and check for landlords' specific restrictions. Then I'll gather listings from several property portals.\n\n**Reviewing rental listings near target MRT stations**\n\nI\u2019ve found some options close to MRT stations, but there are trade-offs:\n\n- The Midtown at Upper Serangoon Road fits the price and distance, but I\u2019ll need to double-check the allowed usage.\n- 335 Hougang Ave 7 is too far at 16 minutes, so it doesn\u2019t work.\n- The Promenade @ Pelikat is borderline but within 10 minutes and meets the price. I\u2019ll include it with a note.\n\n**Searching for additional listings near MRT stations**\n\nOkay, I should search specific property portals like CommercialGuru and 99.co with filters for properties under $3500 near the target MRT stations (Hougang, Kovan, Serangoon). I\u2019ll compile options from multiple sources but keep in mind that availability changes fast, so I\u2019ll include disclaimers and remind the user to check the links directly.\n\n**Reviewing and filtering relevant listings**\n\nI\u2019m going through the results, and I\u2019ve found a couple of good options meeting the criteria: both Midtown listings near Hougang MRT at the right price and distance. I'll focus on filtering further within district D19, targeting Hougang, Serangoon, Lorong Ah Soo, and Kovan. Plenty to review!\n\n**Reviewing MidTown and Kovan listings**\n\nThe MidTown units near Hougang MRT look promising. Another listing's near Kovan MRT (The Promenade @ Pelikat) at S$2,000, which is quite close to Lorong Ah Soo, fitting some criteria. Also, I see another listing on 99.co at Serangoon Central Drive for S$2,300, which I need to further explore.\n\n**Refining search approach for listings**\n\nI see another listing under line 1456 for S$2,300 at Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre. I need to properly capture rent details for each listing. A better approach might be to search with filters on 99.co for price <=S$3,500 and near the station. Commercialguru might be easier, though, since their listings include price and distance, especially for shop or office spaces. They'll likely be useful for tuition centers.\n\n**Ensuring criteria fit for tuition spaces**\n\nWe need to focus on listings within 10 minutes of an MRT station and under $3,500. HDB shophouses are a good possibility since they tend to be smaller, especially second-floor units, which may be cheaper. I\u2019ll search for \"HDB shop for rent tuition\" and include small office spaces, noting that some industrial areas may have zoning restrictions on tuition centers.\n\n**Focusing search on tuition-friendly rental units**\n\nSince the user is looking for spaces suitable for private tuition, I'll focus the search on listings mentioning \"tuition,\" \"education,\" or similar terms. I'll also include retail/office units that allow such uses with proper approval, and filter them by relevant locations like Hougang and Kovan with a budget under $3,500.\n\n**Reviewing rental options near key areas**\n\nThe search results show some potentially suitable office units near Kovan, like a $3,400 office space at 850 sqft, which could work for tuition if allowed. There's also a tuition center listing near Hougang, though the location may be incorrect. Additionally, a $3,300 unit near Buangkok is close to Hougang but outside the target area.\n\n**Considering various rental options for tuition purposes**\n\nThe location near Buangkok might be included as it\u2019s close to Hougang, though the user emphasized Hougang or Kovan specifically. I\u2019m focusing on both whole units and classrooms within existing centers while ensuring compliance with their preference for small spaces. I\u2019ll keep these categories separate for clarity.\n\n**Gathering relevant listing details**\n\nThe user might want a list of potential rental spaces. I'll gather listings from key portals like CommercialGuru, PropertyGuru, 99.co, SRX, and Carousell. We\u2019ll focus on verifying price and distance, ensuring they match the criteria. I'll also check additional results near Kovan and refine the list if needed.\n\n**Reviewing listings and clarifying locations**\n\nThe listings show interesting options like a 200 sqft unit in Hougang Avenue 7, 9 minutes from Hougang MRT, but I need to verify the price by checking further lines on the page. There's also a suitable unit in Hougang Green Mall at $3,300. A listing in Sengkang might be in Hougang estate but needs clarification.\n\n**Verifying details and checking listings**\n\nIt seems Hougang Street 11 could be near Kovan or Hougang Central, but the listing might be mis-labeled as Sengkang. The rent of $1,600 for 1,500 sqft is too cheap\u2014maybe it's a shared space. I'll check the listing on 99.co for full details or use CommercialGuru instead, as it\u2019s usually more complete.\n\n**Adjusting search criteria for listings**\n\nI\u2019ll check CommercialGuru for properties near NE14 Hougang MRT, filtering by max price of $3,500. The URL might look something like \"property-for-rent/near-ne14-hougang-mrt-station-185\". I\u2019ll fine-tune the search and apply the price filter to narrow down to suitable listings. Let\u2019s give it a try!\n\n**Refining Serangoon MRT search results**\n\nWe've got a filtered list for properties under $3.5K near CC13/NE12 Serangoon MRT but some are 11 minutes away, while the user requested a max of 10 minutes. I'll keep checking additional listings to see if anything fits within the 10-minute range. I\u2019ll also consider including Serangoon North MRT, since it\u2019s nearby and relevant.\n\n**Clarifying rental options near Serangoon and Kovan**\n\nThe user's request includes areas like Hougang, Serangoon, Lorong Ah Soo, and Kovan, so I can include Serangoon North MRT (CR9) as well, as it\u2019s within 10 minutes of walk time. I found a listing for 94 Kovan Road, which is near Serangoon MRT with a rental price under $3500. Let me refine the search more.\n\n**Finalizing rental options near Kovan and Serangoon**\n\nThe listing on Kovan Road seems to fit the requirements, with a 10-minute distance from Serangoon MRT, and the price of $2,400 is within budget. I also found another listing, \"The Promenade @ Pelikat,\" with multiple units at varying prices, all within 10 minutes from Kovan MRT.\n\n**Finalizing rental options in Kovan/Serangoon**\n\nI\u2019ve found a few listings near Kovan MRT that meet the price and distance requirements. One includes a rental office space in Kovan, which is exactly on budget and within 5 minutes of the MRT. I also want to look at other retail options and make sure they meet the criteria, especially regarding usage restrictions. I\u2019ll continue to compile more details, including possible HDB shops near Hougang MRT.\n\n**Checking HDB shophouses near Hougang**\n\nI found a potential HDB shop at 335 Hougang Avenue 7, but I need to check the price, as it could be over the 3500 limit. I'll open the relevant listing on 99.co to confirm. I\u2019ll get more details with lines around number 1088, as earlier parts might not include pricing info.\n\n**Confirming MidTown and other listings**\n\nExcluding 335 Hougang Avenue 7 due to its price being $4,000, we have The Midtown retail at $2,000 for 350 sqft, which qualifies on price and distance. The Midtown's location is within Hougang, so we\u2019ll include it. Also, Hougang Green offers retail units within budget, which we should include as well.\n\n**Compiling listings near Serangoon MRT**\n\nI need to gather listings within 10 minutes of Serangoon MRT and a max budget of $3500. There's a listing at 254A Serangoon Central Drive, which is 7 minutes from the MRT, but the price isn't shown. I'll open the listing to get more details and confirm the price.\n\n**Reviewing Serangoon MRT area listings**\n\nI've found several listings near Serangoon MRT:\n\n- A 1500 sqft retail shop in Sengkang for $1,600, which could be a tuition centre or partial space. The price seems too low, so I'll need to verify details.\n- Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre has several units ranging from $2,050 to $2,400.\n- 254A Serangoon Central Drive is a 156 sqft unit for $2,000, which fits the criteria. I'll explore more.\n\n**Confirming listings for tuition-related spaces near Serangoon**\n\nThe $1,600 listing for 1399 sqft at Bartley seems too cheap, possibly for a desk. It\u2019s industrial, which may not be suitable for tuition, and the price feels odd. I might include it if legit, though. \n\nThe 99.co listing showing 9 minutes at 719m is better. I'll prioritize finding listings on CommercialGuru within 10 minutes.\n\n**Verifying listings near Serangoon MRT**\n\nThe Space @ Kovan units seem promising. Even though they\u2019re on Yio Chu Kang Road, they\u2019re still near the Serangoon area, close to Serangoon North and are accessible. With a price range of $2,000 to $3,000, they meet the distance and price criteria. I'll include these in my search.\n\n**Filtering relevant listings by MRT stations**\n\nI'll focus on filtering listings in the target area for each MRT station, such as Hougang, Kovan, and Serangoon. For each, I\u2019ll capture units within 10-minute walking distances and prices \u2264$3500. I'll also check for any other stations, like Serangoon North, though it wasn\u2019t specifically mentioned. Let's narrow it down.\n\n**Refining target areas and stations**\n\nIt looks like the Cross Island Line isn\u2019t operational yet, so I should avoid listings that mention the Serangoon North MRT station, which is likely just a placeholder. I'll focus on already operating stations like Serangoon, Kovan, Hougang, and possibly Buangkok. Lorong Ah Soo near these is also worth considering.\n\n**Considering relevant properties near Lorong Ah Soo**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about including areas like Bartley since it's near the Serangoon vicinity, but I might be broadening the search too much. Since the user mentioned specific areas, I could still consider these. I\u2019ll try searching specifically for commercial properties near Lorong Ah Soo within the required criteria.\n\n**Filtering relevant properties in Lorong Ah Soo**\n\nThere are some properties on the Lorong Ah Soo page that fit the user's criteria. For example, a unit at Kovan City office rent for $3,400 is valid, and another unit at The Promenade @ Pelikat is good too at $2,990 (though the $7,900 one is over budget). Some listings need further checks, like the Kovan City office.\n\n**Clarifying Kovan City listings**\n\nThere are two relevant Kovan City office listings: one for 850 sqft at $3,400 and another for 400 sqft at $1,850. However, there's some confusion with another $1,350 listing for 850 sqft, where the price per square foot doesn't match the $3,400/mo rent, possibly indicating a different listing or price change.\n\n**Clarifying listings and prices**\n\nIt seems the price listings at lines 254-255 belong to a \"Shop/Shophouse\" in Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre, not the Kovan City office. The 172 sqft at $7.85 psf matches the $1,350 rent for that location. Also, the listing for The Promenade @ Pelikat is $2,990 for 205 sqft, which checks out.\n\n**Clarifying conflicting listings**\n\nThere's a potential mix-up with the pricing details. The listing at lines 289-318 with \"$1,200/mo $5.85 psf\" seems to be for a different shop in Upper Serangoon, not matching the square footage calculations. The $1,350/mo for a Kovan City office at 850 sqft makes sense, but there\u2019s some confusion around the Upper Serangoon listing.\n\n**Clarifying the layout and price confusion**\n\nThe price at lines 254-255 might be for the Kovan City office, but the calculated figures don\u2019t align with earlier listings. The $1,350 listing doesn\u2019t match the earlier $3,400 rent shown. It\u2019s likely a case where the price layout\u2019s structure is affecting the clarity of which listing it belongs to.\n\n**Clarifying Kovan City office listings**\n\nIt looks like there might be two different Kovan City office listings, both 850 sqft, but with different prices \u2014 one listed at $3,400 and another at $1,350. The structure of the page suggests these could be separate listings, though both are labeled as Kovan City offices. This could create the confusion about price discrepancies.\n\n**Clarifying Kovan City and Hougang Avenue listings**\n\nIt seems like the price lines at 211-212 are actually for the 108 Hougang Avenue 1 listing, not the Kovan City office. The price of $3,400/month and $4 psf fit better for the 750 sqft space. As for Kovan City, its price of $1,350 might be for a separate 172 sqft listing. The confusion continues.\n\n**Resolving the Kovan City and Upper Serangoon Listings**\n\nIt seems the Kovan City office listing at $1,350/month is for a 172 sqft space, not 850 sqft, since $1,350/172 equals the expected $7.85 psf. As for the Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre, the price of $1,200/month at $5.85 psf corresponds to about 205 sqft, and should likely belong to the other listing.\n\n**Clarifying the Upper Serangoon Listing**\n\nThe bullet price of $1,200/month seems to correspond to Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre. If the size is 205 sqft, the rent aligns better with the $5.85 psf rate. The header lists 172 sqft, which doesn\u2019t match properly. This suggests some misalignment in the scraped data from 99.co, making it preferable to verify through CommercialGuru for more accuracy. We can click each listing for full details.\n\n**Organizing the Search for Commercial Listings**\n\nI\u2019ll focus on identifying listings for key candidate units by browsing summary pages, clicking into individual listings to collect details like rent, size, etc. The properties to check include several malls and offices around Hougang, Kovan, and Serangoon MRTs, along with potentially lower-rent HDB shops.\n\n**Finding direct access to specific URLs**\n\nThe web tool restricts opening certain URLs, so I\u2019ll bypass this by searching for each exact URL or performing a search query using the site-specific domain. For instance, I could use \u201csite:commercialguru.com.sg\u201d and similar terms to access the listings directly. I\u2019ll start with those queries.\n\n**Refining search for units near Kovan and Hougang MRT**\n\nI've found some useful listings near Hougang MRT, with units priced under $3,500, like  $3,300 and $3,500 units in MidTown \u2014 great! I'll focus on these.\n\nFor Kovan MRT, I need to filter further with price restrictions, particularly under $3,500, as the results are more spread out across several pages.\n\n**Identifying candidate listings around Kovan MRT**\n\nThe Kovan MRT rent page has several relevant listings. I\u2019ll filter for those priced under $3,500 and within a 10-minute walk. Some good finds include: \n\n- Space @ Kovan (161 sqft, $1,400)\n- Highland Centre (592 sqft, $2,600)\n- Heartland Mall (550 sqft, $2,990)\n \nThese meet all the criteria!\n\n**Reviewing relevant listings near Kovan and Hougang MRT**\n\nThere are several appealing options near Kovan MRT, including multiple listings at Promenade @ Pelikat, with prices ranging from $1,850 to $2,500\u2014great finds! Additionally, I\u2019ll check Hougang area using CommercialGuru\u2019s near Hougang MRT page. Filtering by both price and location will help narrow things down efficiently.\n\n**Exploring Hougang MRT listings further**\n\nThere are a few options near Hougang, like The MidTown with a couple of units priced at $3,300 and $3,500. 99.co has another 350 sqft unit here for $2,000. I'll also explore other potential small office units near Hougang MRT, such as those at Hougang Mall, filtering by price.\n\n**Compiling listings for Hougang and Kovan**\n\nI found some commercial listings near Hougang MRT, including options at The Midtown that may exceed the $3500 price limit, but it\u2019s worth checking. I\u2019ll compile listings from CommercialGuru, 99.co, and SRX, including places like Promenade, Heartland Mall, and possibly even Serangoon Central\u2019s small HDB shop units under $3500.\n\n**Identifying relevant listings near Kovan**\n\nI\u2019ll include a variety of commercial properties near Kovan, like the Kovan City office, Heartland Mall, and Space @ Kovan. While some might be private shophouses or industrial-type buildings, they meet the commercial criteria. Also, I\u2019ll check the potential HDB shops in the Hougang area, like 203 Hougang Street 21, for small rental offices or shophouses.\n\n**Clarifying building types and classification**\n\nI\u2019ll categorize the listings into HDB-managed shops and private commercial spaces like strata retail and offices. For each, I\u2019ll note the type. Since the user plans to conduct tuition with fewer than 10 students, I\u2019ll look into compliance issues, like Singapore\u2019s Private Education Act and the registration threshold.\n\n**Verifying tuition regulations and property guidelines**\n\nI\u2019ll need to verify that small tuition centers with fewer than 10 students don\u2019t need to register under the Private Education Act. Additionally, I'll check official guidelines for property use, like URA's \"Change of Use\" rules for tuition classes, and look into fire safety and noise regulations from SCDF and NEA.\n\n**Researching tuition regulations and property use**\n\nI'll need to confirm if tuition held in commercial premises would require \"change of use\" to qualify as an \"Education Centre\" or \"School,\" especially considering parking/drop-off restrictions. Additionally, I'll verify the rule on MOE registration for private schools and tuition centers with more than 10 students at once.\n\n**Clarifying the MOE registration requirement for tuition centers**\n\nThe official MOE page confirms that if a tuition center offers education to 10 or more students, it must be registered as a private school under the Education Act. If the user plans to have fewer than 10 students, registration isn\u2019t required, but other regulations, such as business registration and fire safety, still apply.\n\n**Clarifying use of premises for tuition centers**\n\nFor a tuition center, using commercial premises may require URA approval for \u2018commercial school\u2019 or \u2018education center\u2019. HDB premises also need consent and may require \u201cchange of use\u201d permission. It\u2019s best to find premises already approved for such use or where tuition is welcomed. We'll compile a list based on that.\n\n**Providing rental listings with proper citations**\n\nI\u2019ll use a table to present rental listings, including relevant details and citations. Citations will be kept plain to avoid rendering issues. I\u2019ll mention that these are asking rents from portals as of January 28, 2026, understanding that they may change. I\u2019ll aim to be as comprehensive as possible and list units around Kovan and Serangoon within 10 minutes.\n\n**Exploring additional rental options**\n\nI need to check for other available units around Kovan, including \"Highland Centre,\" \"Space @ Kovan,\" and \"Heartland Mall,\" as well as potential smaller spaces in \"Hougang 1.\" Some second-floor units or kiosks may be below $3500, so I'll keep looking for options in the surrounding areas.\n\n**Searching for affordable commercial properties near Kovan**\n\nI found a listing for a first-floor HDB shop near Hougang, but it's too expensive at S$4,200. So, I'll search for \"HDB commercial shop near Kovan under S$3,500.\" To narrow it down, I'll explore property pages related to Kovan MRT and apply relevant price filters. Let's check those results!\n\n**Collecting relevant listings near Kovan MRT**\n\nI noticed that some results on CommercialGuru, like \"Serangoon rent,\" have industrial listings that aren't helpful. Focusing on the area I need, I found a promising storefront near Kovan MRT\u2014677 sqft for S$3,500. Now, I'll check the Kovan MRT rent page for more details, including places like Promenade.\n\n**Compiling relevant listings near Kovan MRT**\n\nI found a good listing near Kovan MRT, perfect for private tuition: S$950/mo for a 100 sqft shop/space. It's within price and distance, but likely a room or shared space. Other valuable listings include The Promenade @ Pelikat\u2014S$1,500 for 205 sqft and S$2,000 for 312 sqft.\n\n**Prioritizing Kovan listings and using remaining calls wisely**\n\nI need to extract more listings from the Kovan page, but with only two web calls left, I\u2019ll focus on already retrieved data. If necessary, I can try to fetch more by opening higher lines or rely on Page 2, which already includes useful listings like Space@Kovan and The Promenade.\n\n**Compiling listings and regulatory compliance**\n\nThere are more Promenade units to include, like those priced $1,200\u2013$2,200, along with listings from Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre, Space@Kovan, and properties from 99.co for Serangoon Central. I\u2019ll summarize regulatory and compliance aspects, including MOE registration, URA/HDB, and fire safety, with citations. Then, I\u2019ll present the compiled listing, broken down by area.\n\n**Compiling listing details**\n\nI\u2019ll include key details for each listing:\n\n- Building/Address\n- Property Type (Shop, Mall Shop, Office, etc.)\n- Floor Area (sqft)\n- Asking Rent (S$/mo)\n- Distance to MRT (mins, meters)\n- Source and Listing Date\n\nI\u2019ll enforce the price limit of <= S$3,500, and I'll compile the listings from CommercialGuru and 99.co for the Hougang MRT area and beyond.\n\n**Compiling Kovan and Hougang Green listings**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the latest listings around Kovan MRT and Buangkok MRT, all under S$3,500:\n\nFrom CommercialGuru:\n- The Promenade @ Pelikat has numerous rentals, ranging from S$1,500 to S$2,500 for various shop spaces.\nFrom other sources:\n- Hougang Green Shopping Mall offers spaces from S$2,400 to S$3,300.\n\nI\u2019ll ensure recency and include citations for each listing.\n\n**Kovan and surrounding listings under S$3,500**\n\nHere are some additional Kovan area listings I\u2019ve found, including rent details (confirmed or approximated):\n\n- Office and shophouses ranging from S$950 to S$3,500 within 5-10 minutes of Kovan MRT. Notably, 852 sqft spaces at Kovan City and Heartland Mall. \n- Some listings fall just outside Kovan MRT but remain within the area, covered by Serangoon MRT.\n\nI\u2019m not including rent for an incomplete snippet listing, as we can't rely on it for now.\n\n**Serangoon/Kovan listings within 10 minutes**\n\nLooking at additional options in Serangoon, I\u2019ve found listings like:\n\n- 156 sqft for S$2,000/mo and 240 sqft for S$2,050/mo from Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre. \n- Space @ Kovan offers smaller retail and office rentals from S$1,400 in the same 10-minute radius. \n\nI'll exclude a medical space and clarify one listing that might be too large for the user's needs.\n\n**Clarifying Kovan City listings and discrepancies**\n\nThere\u2019s a potential listing for a 400 sqft office at Kovan City, but the price doesn't align with the sqft measurements. The numbers don\u2019t add up, leading me to rely more on CommercialGuru for accuracy. I\u2019ll exclude the confusing Lorong Ah Soo entry in favor of clearer listings.\n\n**Clarifying data sourcing and self-extension tips**\n\nThe data from 99.co may be inconsistent due to page structure issues, so I\u2019ll rely on more reliable sources like CommercialGuru for listing details. Given limited tool calls, I\u2019ll provide search tips to allow the user to extend the search on portals without overwhelming them with raw URLs.\n\n**Providing search links and education regulations caution**\n\nI can give a set of search links in a code block for easy access, as requested. I'll include disclaimers to verify with agents or landlords about tuition use and check specific registration guidelines with MOE. I'll highlight that the \"10 or more persons\" may refer to total enrollment and not just simultaneous students.\n\n**Compiling rental listings and classifying units**\n\nI'll create a table of listings, classifying units as HDB shophouses, mall shops, or offices. I'll be careful with HDB identification, labeling uncertain ones as \"likely HDB\" and noting price limits. I'll ensure all listed prices are within the $3,500 cap and include relevant disclaimers about space and usage eligibility.\n\n**Listing rental options and creating compliance notes**\n\nI\u2019m creating a table to include only listings under $3,500 and within 10 minutes of MRT stations, with a column for compliance details. We'll outline important points such as HDB verification, tuition suitability, and MOE/URA rules. Each listing will have citations for added transparency, with notes for tuition-related compliance.\n\n**Clarifying tenancy and regulations for small tuition centers**\n\nFor small tuition centers (under 10 students per session), you may not need MOE registration, but ensure that the property is approved for educational use. You must also check fire safety and infrastructure compliance. Some rental units near MRT stations are small, so consider space limitations. Other key regulations include change-of-use requirements for HDB properties and business registration with ACRA for operations. Make sure to check relevant websites for full details."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 24m 44s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-westus3-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-84b23059-6d71-41d7-8b99-25686675bad7:US","parent_id":"90896e79-ae6e-43b0-bebf-63349abe0f82","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_69798cafc51c819199dd7507d895aa01","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"69798caf-c604-839b-a7a9-042e0b0dc0bf","async_task_created_at":"2026-01-28T04:12:32.024305Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"90896e79-ae6e-43b0-bebf-63349abe0f82","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"84b23059-6d71-41d7-8b99-25686675bad7","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"3228a070-5d0a-4e14-95ab-514896561988","finished_duration_sec":1484,"pro_skipped":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"90896e79-ae6e-43b0-bebf-63349abe0f82","children":["8fed4bb1-01cf-48d4-a885-133c32c608ba"]},"8fed4bb1-01cf-48d4-a885-133c32c608ba":{"id":"8fed4bb1-01cf-48d4-a885-133c32c608ba","message":{"id":"8fed4bb1-01cf-48d4-a885-133c32c608ba","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769575036.996435,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Below is what I can compile **right now (as of 28 Jan 2026)** for **commercial units in/around Hougang\u2013Kovan\u2013Serangoon\u2013Lorong Ah Soo** that appear to meet your hard constraints:\n\n- **Asking rent \u2264 S$3,500/month**\n- **Stated walking distance \u2264 10 min to an MRT station**\n- **Commercial / retail / shop / office\u2013type units** that are commonly used (or marketed) for services/education **subject to approvals**\n\nBecause listings change daily, treat this as a **shortlist of currently-advertised candidates**, not a guaranteed full inventory.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance checkpoints (so you don\u2019t get burned later)\n\n### 1) When MOE registration kicks in (your \u201c<10 students\u201d point)\nMOE states you need to register a private school (this includes **tuition/enrichment centres teaching mainstream subjects**) if the school **offers education for 10 or more persons**. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search0\ue201  \nMOE has also stated (Parliamentary reply) that centres offering tuition/enrichment to **10 or more students** must be registered. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search23\ue201  \n\n**Important nuance:** the wording is about \u201coffers education for 10 or more persons/students\u201d \u2014 not explicitly \u201c10 seated in the room at once\u201d.
