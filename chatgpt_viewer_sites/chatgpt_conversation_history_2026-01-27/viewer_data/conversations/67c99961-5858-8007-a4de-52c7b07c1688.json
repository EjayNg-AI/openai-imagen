Here, we show that fun-\ndamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter\nphases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate in these phases. This bound is in agreement with ab\ninitio simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies\nan upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature Tc in condensed matter. Fundamental\nconstants set this limit to the order of 102 \u2212 103 K. This range is consistent with our calculations\nof Tc from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the\ncurrent research of finding Tc at and above 300 K is due to the observed values of fundamental\nconstants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of\nother effects and phenomena including phase transitions.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe governing role of fundamental physical constants\nhas been extensively discussed in high-energy particle\nphysics and astrophysics. Examples include the stabil-\nity of nuclei, nuclear reactions, and the formation and\nevolution of stars \u2013 where heavy elements are produced\nand give rise to other observable structures. In these\nand other processes, fundamental constants give the Uni-\nverse its observed properties and separate it from poten-\ntial other universes where these constants may be dif-\nferent [1\u20139]. Understanding the origin of fundamental\nconstants and their fine-tuning is considered one of the\ngrand challenges in science [10, 11]. Approaching this\nchallenge starts with deepening our understanding of how\nfundamental constants affect phenomena spanning the\nlength and energy scales between particle physics and\nastrophysics [12\u201314].\n\nIn condensed matter physics and in other areas that\nsupport a continuum description of matter, such as elas-\nticity and hydrodynamics, system properties are driven\nby many-body collective effects. These effects are of-\n\n\u2217k.trachenko@qmul.ac.uk\n\nten considered as emergent and thus not reducible to\nindividual particles whose properties are set by funda-\nmental constants. It was therefore unexpected when\nit was discovered that fundamental constants govern\nthe bounds, characteristic values and properties of sev-\neral key many-body collective processes. Examples in-\nclude viscosity [15\u201317], diffusion and spin dynamics [18\u2013\n22], electron and heat transport [23\u201326], thermal conduc-\ntivity in insulators [27] and conductors [13], the speed\nof sound [28], elastic moduli including those in lower-\ndimensional systems [12, 13], thermal expansion, melt-\ning [29, 30] and velocity gradients that can be set up in\ncells using biochemical energy [31]. In these examples,\nproperties are governed by either fundamental constants\nonly or by a combination of these constants with other\nparameters such as temperature. The implications of\nthese findings extend to both fundamental and applied\nscience [12].\n\nHere, we show that fundamental physical constants\nprovide an upper bound to the frequency of phonons in\ncondensed matter phases, setting a limit to the vibra-\ntional frequency of atoms in these phases. This bound\ninvolves the dimensionless electron-to-proton mass ratio\n\u03b2, the key constant involved in setting the finely-tuned\n\u201chabitable zone\u201d of our world in the (\u03b1, \u03b2) space, where\n\u03b1 is the fine-structure constant [1]. The bound applies\n\nPage 1 of 9 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - JPCM-124400.R1\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60 A\n\ncc\nep\n\nte\nd \n\nM\nan\n\nus\ncr\n\nip\nt\n\n\n\n2\n\nto non-molecular systems, and we find it to be in agree-\nment with ab initio simulations of atomic hydrogen and\nhydride superconductors which, as hydrogen is the light-\nest nucleus (a single proton), host the highest possible\nphonon frequencies. We subsequently show that this up-\nper bound in the maximal phonon frequency implies an\nupper bound to the phonon-mediated superconducting\ncritical temperature Tc in condensed matter. In partic-\nular, we show that fundamental constants set the upper\nbound to Tc on the order of 102 \u2212 103 K, consistent with\ncalculations of Tc from optimal Eliashberg functions. We\nalso observe that in addition to electron-phonon cou-\npling, the bound to Tc in terms of fundamental constants\napplies to other coupling mechanisms such as electron-\nelectron coupling. This implies that the current search\nfor Tc at and above 300 K is itself due to fundamental\nconstants taking their observed values. We finally ob-\nserve that fundamental constants affect the observability\nand operation of other phenomena in condensed matter\nphysics including phase transitions. This has wider im-\nplications compared to earlier work discussing how fun-\ndamental constants set bounds on properties that are al-\nready observed [12\u201316, 18\u201328, 31].\n\nII. METHODS\n\nIn our density functional theory calculations, we use\nsimilar methods to our earlier paper [28]. This includes\nusing the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-\ncorrelation functional [32], an energy cutoff of 1200 eV\nand a k-point grid of spacing 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.025 A\u030a\u22121 to sample\nthe electronic Brillouin zone.\n\nWe relax cell parameters and internal coordinates to\nobtain a pressure to within 10\u22124 GPa of the target pres-\nsure and forces smaller than 10\u22125 eV/A\u030a. We calculate the\nphonon dispersion using the finite displacement method\n[33] in conjunction with nondiagonal supercells [34] with\na 4\u00d7 4\u00d7 4 coarse q-point grid to sample the vibrational\nBrillouin zone. We use Fourier interpolation to calculate\nthe phonon frequencies along a high symmetry path in\nthe Brillouin zone.\n\nIII. UPPER BOUND ON THE VIBRATIONAL\nFREQUENCY\n\nWe start with the upper bound on the vibrational fre-\nquency. Oscillations are ubiquitous in nature and play a\ncentral role in all areas of physics, including condensed\nmatter physics. The question of how high the oscilla-\ntion frequency of an atom can be in solids or liquids is\ntherefore of general importance.\n\nThe maximal frequency in a given condensed system,\n\u03c9m, is the largest frequency in the phonon dispersion,\nand is typically close to the Debye frequency \u03c9D. We are\ninterested in an upper bound, \u03c9u\n\nm, on this maximal fre-\nquency (and thus an upper bound on all phonon frequen-\n\ncies). We recall two important properties of condensed\nmatter phases: the interatomic separation a and a cohe-\nsive, or bonding, energy E. The Bohr radius, aB, sets\nthe characteristic scale of a to the order of Angstroms:\n\naB =\n4\u03c0\u03b50~2\n\nmee2\n(1)\n\nand the Rydberg energy, ER = e2\n\n8\u03c0\u03b50aB\n[35], sets the char-\n\nacteristic scale of E to the order of several eV:\n\nER =\nmee\n\n4\n\n32\u03c02\u03b520~2\n(2)\n\nwhere e and me are electron charge and mass.\nThe ratio ~\u03c9m\n\nE can be derived by approximating ~\u03c9m\n\nas ~\n(\nE\nma2\n\n) 1\n2 , where m is the atom mass and then either\n\n(a) using a = aB from (1) and E = ER from (2) or (b)\n\nusing E = ~2\n\n2mea2\n. This gives, up to a factor of order one\n\n(\n\u221a\n\n2), the following relation:\n\n~\u03c9m\n\nE\n=\n(me\n\nm\n\n) 1\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe same ratio (3) follows by combining two known\nrelations in metallic systems: ~\u03c9m\n\nE \u2248 c\nvF\n\n, where vF is the\nFermi velocity and c is the speed of sound, and c\n\nvF\n\u2248(\n\nme\n\nm\n\n) 1\n2 , providing an order-of-magnitude estimation of\n\n~\u03c9m\n\nE in other systems too [35].\nThe upper bound \u03c9u\n\nm is obtained from Eq. (3) by set-\nting m = mp, the proton mass, corresponding to atomic\nhydrogen. Combining this with Eq. (2) yields finally\n\n\u03c9u\nm =\n\n1\n\n32\u03c02\u03b520\n\nmee\n4\n\n~3\n\n(\nme\n\nmp\n\n) 1\n2\n\n(4)\n\nInterestingly, \u03c9u\nm in (4) can also be written in terms of\n\nthe Compton frequency \u03c9C = mec\n2\n\n~ and the fine structure\n\nconstant \u03b1 = 1\n4\u03c0\u03b50\n\ne2\n\n~c as\n\n\u03c9u\nm =\n\n1\n\n2\n\u03c9C\u03b1\n\n2\n\n(\nme\n\nmp\n\n) 1\n2\n\n(5)\n\nEquation (5) offers a simple result showing that the\nupper bound to the atomic oscillation frequency is set by\nthe Compton frequency times the square of \u03b1 and the\nsquare-root of the electron-to-proton mass ratio.\n\nEquation (4) sets \u03c9u\nm in terms of fundamental phys-\n\nical constants. The constants ~, me, and e determine\nthe electromagnetic energy scale driving atomic oscilla-\ntions. The proton mass mp is intrinsic to the atoms be-\ning driven and sets the scale (both in time, and space)\n\nPage 2 of 9AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - JPCM-124400.R1\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60 A\n\ncc\nep\n\nte\nd \n\nM\nan\n\nus\ncr\n\nip\nt\n\n\n\n3\n\nof the oscillatory response. Interestingly, \u03c9u\nm involves the\n\nelectron-to-proton mass ratio \u03b2 = me\n\nmp\n. This dimension-\n\nless constant is considered of fundamental importance:\ntogether with the fine-structure constant, it sets a finely-\ntuned habitable zone in (\u03b1, \u03b2) space where it governs\nthe stability of molecular structures, processes involved\nin igniting and fuelling stars (and thus the production of\nheavy elements), and other essential effects giving rise to\nour observable world [1].\n\nWith ER=13.6 eV and \u03b2 = me\n\nmp\n= 1\n\n1836 , \u03c9u\nm in Eq. (4)\n\nis about (here and below, kB = 1):\n\n\u03c9u\nm = 3680 K (6)\n\nThe upper bound \u03c9u\nm in (6) is of the same order of mag-\n\nnitude, but above, the experimental Debye frequency \u03c9D\n\nof 2240 K in ambient pressure diamond [36], the hard-\nest known material [37] or a similar value of the maximal\nphonon frequency in graphene [38].\n\nThe upper bound (4)-(6) corresponds to solid hydrogen\nwith strong metallic bonding. Although this phase only\nexists at megabar pressures [39\u201341] and is thermodynam-\nically and dynamically unstable at ambient pressure, it\nis interesting to check the validity of our bound and cal-\nculate \u03c9m in atomic hydrogen. The importance of this\ncalculation is also highlighted by the strong interest in\nthe properties of atomic hydrogen at high pressure (see,\ne.g., Refs. [39\u201341]).\n\nBefore calculating \u03c9m, we first evaluate the effect of\npressure on the fundamental bound (4) because solid\natomic hydrogen exists at high pressure only as men-\ntioned above. We make two remarks in relation to the\npressure effect. First, hydrogen is a unique element with\nno core electrons. As compared to heavier elements, this\ngives weaker repulsive contributions to the interatomic\ninteraction and weaker pressure dependence of elastic\nmoduli [42]. As a result, pressure has a weaker effect\non \u03c9m in hydrogen as compared to other systems. Sec-\nond, the effect of pressure on \u03c9u\n\nm can be approximately\nestimated by adding the term PV to E in Eq. (3), rep-\nresenting the work needed to overcome the elastic defor-\nmation [43] due to external pressure in order to surmount\nthe energy of cohesion. Here, V is the elementary volume\non the order of a3. According to Eq. (3), this increases\n\u03c9um(P ) as\n\n\u03c9u\nm(P ) = \u03c9u\n\nm +\n\n(\nme\n\nmp\n\n) 1\n2 a3P\n\n~\n(7)\n\nWe note that the full treatment of pressure dependence\nof frequency for a particular system involves the system-\nspecific equation of state and may involve nonlinear elas-\nticity [44]. This introduces system-specificity in \u03c9u\n\nm(P ).\nOur aim here is to evaluate the effect of pressure in terms\nof fundamental constants only. This evaluation is neces-\nsarily approximate and provides an order-of-magnitude\nestimation [12, 13].

This structure is calculated to become\nthermodynamically stable in the pressure range 400\u2013600\nGPa [47\u201349], below which solid hydrogen is a molecular\nsolid. We perform density functional theory (DFT) cal-\nculations using the castep package [50]. Details of DFT\ncalculations are given in the Appendix.\n\nA representative phonon dispersion for atomic hydro-\ngen at 400 GPa is shown Fig. 1, with the maximal phonon\nfrequency occuring at the N point of the Brillouin zone\nwith reciprocal space coordinates (0, 1\n\n2 , 0). The maximal\nfrequencies in the calculated phonon dispersion curves\nare shown in Fig. 2 as a function of pressure, and they are\nlocated at the N point for pressures below about 600 GPa\nand at the \u0393 point for pressures above that value. The\nlowest pressure depicted corresponds to a pressure above\nthe dynamical stability range of the atomic hydrogen\nstructure. The diagram in Fig. 2 also shows the upper\nbound (6) and \u03c9D in diamond.\n\nWe observe in Fig. 2 that the calculated \u03c9m is only\nslightly above \u03c9u\n\nm at the high pressure of 400 GPa in\natomic hydrogen. Assuming a pressure-independent ef-\nfective a in Eq.

(4)-(6) which use approximate\nrelations such as Eq. (3). Nevertheless, we see that the\nupper bound \u03c9u\n\nm is in good agreement with computa-\ntional results.\n\nIn addition to atomic hydrogen with the lightest\natomic mass, another appropriate test for the theoret-\nical upper bound \u03c9u\n\nm in Eq. (4) involves the comparison\nwith hydrogen-rich systems. These include hydride su-\nperconductors at high pressure, which have been of in-\nterest recently. These systems exhibit the highest su-\nperconducting critical temperature Tc currently known\nextending to 250 K [57\u201359]. For our assessment of the\nmaximal frequency upper bound, we chose a range of\nhydrides based on their chemical and structural variety\nas well as a wide range of pressures at which phonons\nhave been previously calculated using ab initio methods.\nOur list includes data on LaH10 [55] and H3S [54], with\nthe highest experimentally measured Tc, two other bi-\nnary hydrides CaH6 [53] and SrH10 [56], and two ternaries\nMgIrH6 [51] and MgVH6 [52]. The maximal phonon fre-\nquencies extracted from the calculated dispersion curves\nof these hydrides are shown in Fig. 2 as red diamonds.\nWe observe that most points are below the fundamental\nbound \u03c9u\n\nm. The maximal frequency in SrH10 at the high-\n\nest pressure of 300 GPa exceeds the fundamental bound\n(6) but is below the bound accounting for the pressure\neffect (7).\n\nOur derivation of the upper frequency bound is mostly\nsuited to evaluate the highest oscillation frequency of\nacoustic phonon modes or in systems with no substan-\ntial hierarchy of bonding energies and frequencies (recall\nthat we apply Eq. (2) for the bonding energies in the\nsystem). On the other hand, the intra-molecular frequen-\ncies in molecular solids (\u201cvibrons\u201d) can be considerably\nhigher than the rest of the frequency spectrum, and the\nhighest oscillation frequency can be higher than \u03c9u\n\nm in\nthese systems. Considering, for example, H2 molecule\nand using the reduced mass m/2 increases \u03c9m in Eq. (3)\n\nand \u03c9u\nm in Eq. (6) by\n\n\u221a\n2. Recalling that the approximate\n\nderivation of Eq. (3) dropped\n\u221a\n\n2 on the right-hand side,\nthe highest oscillation frequency in hydrogen-containing\nmolecules and molecular solids can increase by a factor\nof 2. Accordingly, one could choose to define the up-\nper bound for the oscillation frequency as 2\u03c9u\n\nm = 7360\nK, in which case it would include molecules and molecu-\nlar solids: highest intra-molecular frequencies are about\n6200-6400 K and lower than 2\u03c9u\n\nm. This could be of inter-\nest from the point of view of having a maximal oscillation\nfrequency in all systems including molecular ones. How-\never, we note that in view of the approximations involved\nin Eqs. (3) and (4), one of the main purposes of Eq. (6)\nis to evaluate the order of magnitude of the maximal fre-\nquency from fundamental constants only.\n\nIn addition to deriving the upper frequency bound, the\ntwo main results in this section are: (a) the upper bound\napplies well to non-molecular systems and (b) Eqs. (4)\nand (6) show that fundamental constants set \u03c9u\n\nm on the\norder of 103\u2013104 K, the result we will use to discuss\nphonon-mediated superconductivity below.\n\nIV.

Upper limit to Tc\n\nWe now discuss the implications of the upper bound of\n\u03c9m for phonon-mediated superconductivity and the su-\nperconducting critical temperature Tc. Upper bounds of\nTc have been discussed on the basis of different mecha-\nnisms and have been related to various system proper-\nties, including the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb,\nthe energy distribution of valence electrons, the phonon\nand Fermi energies, instabilities involving phonons, elec-\ntrons and other instability types, phase fluctuations, and\nstiffness (see, e.g., Refs. [60\u201369] and references therein).\nMore recent work has offered model examples where these\nbounds can be exceeded [70].\n\nOur results on the maximal phonon frequency suggest\nthat the upper limit for Tc in phonon-mediated super-\nconductors may be governed at a deeper level by funda-\n\nPage 4 of 9AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - JPCM-124400.R1\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60 A\n\ncc\nep\n\nte\nd \n\nM\nan\n\nus\ncr\n\nip\nt\n\n\n\n5\n\nmental physical constants. We first consider the Migdal-\nEliashberg (ME) theory of superconductivity involving\nthe electron-phonon coupling relevant to high Tc in hy-\ndrides. We will later discuss the alternative electron-\nelectron coupling mechanism for superconductivity.\n\nIn the ME picture, Tc = C \u03c9, where C is a mono-\ntonically increasing function of \u03bb and \u03c9 is an averaged\nphonon frequency [61, 71]. More recent work explored\neffects beyond the ME theory and noted that they may\nbe inessential for the superconducting state and Tc [67].\nThere are several other interesting insights related to the\neffects of phonons and \u03bb on Tc. First, depending on the\nsystem, different phonon modes may contribute differ-\nently to \u03bb and Tc. This has been recently discussed\nin hydrides where different hydrogen-dominated modes\ncombine with other element-dominated modes to set \u03bb\n[51\u201356]. Second, a more general insight is that Tc has\na maximum at a certain C due to the competition be-\ntween the increase of Tc with \u03bb and the suppression of\nTc due to instabilities at large \u03bb [61, 64, 65, 71, 72] (see\nRef. [73] of the effect of soft phonons in this regard).\nSupported by model simulations, theory, and empirical\ndata, C is C \u2248 0.1 [64, 65] and increases to 0.2-0.3 for a\ndifferent type of instability [69]. Assuming that different\ntypes of instabilities all operate, the upper bound to Tc\ncorresponds to the lower range of C which induces the\ninstability and re-organisation first, with the associated\nlowering of Tc. Interestingly, a similar C in the range\n0.1 \u2212 0.2 corresponds to \u03bb = 1 \u2212 2 [61, 71], which are\ntypical values of \u03bb in hydrides under pressure [74] where\nthe highest Tc is observed [57\u201359]. We are interested in\nan upper bound for Tc, hence we substitute the average\n\u03c9\u0304 by the maximal phonon frequency \u03c9m. Then, using\nEq. (4) for \u03c9u\n\nm at zero pressure, the upper bound of Tc,\nwhich we call Tuc , is\n\nTuc = C\u03c9u\nm = C\n\n(\nme\n\nmp\n\n) 1\n2 1\n\n32\u03c02\u03b520\n\nmee\n4\n\n~3\n(8)\n\nUsing \u03c9u\nm set by fundamental constants in Eq. (6) and\n\nC in the above range 0.1 \u2212 0.2, Eq. (8) gives Tuc in the\nrange 370\u2013740 K and on the order of\n\nTuc = 102 \u2212 103 K (9)\n\nThe scale of Tuc in Eqs. (8)-(9) is set by fundamental\nphysical constants (the order of magnitude of C is not\nvariable). This has interesting implications to which we\nwill return later.\n\nThe range (9) can be verified numerically from ME the-\nory, where the central quantity is the phonon-frequency-\nresolved coupling strength, given by the Eliashberg func-\ntion \u03b12F (\u03c9). Restricting \u03b12F (\u03c9) to frequencies below\nthe upper bound \u03c9um (6), we can directly calculate an\nupper bound on Tc as\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\n600\n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000\n\n0.0\n\n2.5\n\n5.0\n\n7.5\n\n10.0\n\n12.5\n\n15.0\n\n17.5\n\nFIG. 3: The evolution of the Eliashberg function \u03b12F (\u03c9) and\ncorresponding Tc (inset) as Eq.

Details of this\noptimization procedure are available in the Appendix.\n\nSuch an optimization is shown in Fig. 3 for a fixed\nvalue of \u03bb = 2, and converges to Tuc \u223c 600 K, well within\nthe range of Eq. (9). Since Tc is the result of a trade-\noff between \u03bb and \u03c9\u0304 [73] one would expect that, in the\nface of a \u03bb limited by instability, \u03c9\u0304 becomes the central\nquantity. Indeed, we see that the optimization proceeds\nby shifting spectral weight to as high a frequency as pos-\nsible, corroborating other work employing dispersionless\n(Einstein) phonons to obtain an upper bound to Tc [69],\nand confirming that the value of \u03c9um is the limiting factor\nin the optimization.\n\nTuc in Eq. (8) can be made more stringent and adapt-\nable to a particular family of materials. Recall that (a)\nER used to evaluate the bonding energy E is larger than\nbonding energies in real materials and (b) the average\nmass in real materials is larger than the proton mass mp\n\nfeaturing in Eqs. (4) and (8). Both effects reduce Tuc . Ac-\ncording to Eqs. (3), (4), and (8), the difference between\nE and ER results in Tuc decreasing by a factor Eeff\n\nER\n, where\n\nEeff is the effective bonding energy in the relevant sub-\nsystem. The difference between the average mass and mp\n\nreduces Tuc by a factor\n(\nmeff\n\nmp\n\n) 1\n2\n\n, where meff is the effec-\n\ntive mass in the relevant subsystem. The same approx-\nimate reasoning applies to the upper frequency bound\n(4).\n\nPage 5 of 9 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - JPCM-124400.R1\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60 A\n\ncc\nep\n\nte\nd \n\nM\nan\n\nus\ncr\n\nip\nt\n\n\n\n6\n\nWe note that we do not consider the effect of pressure\non Tc. Tc can be a non-monotonic function of pressure\nand involve complex effects including, for example, effects\nof pressure on phonon frequencies, \u03bb, screened Coulomb\npseudopotential and so on [76]. In particular, to repeat\nthe analysis in this work, the affect of pressure on the\ninstability limit to \u03bb would need to be accounted for.\n\nWe also note that our bound (8) invited a recent dis-\ncussion in Ref. [77]. This work derived an upper bound\nto Tc using a different type of arguments and interest-\ningly showed that this bound is expressed as the same\ncombination of fundamental constants as Eq. (8).\n\nB. Other coupling mechanisms\n\nThe above discussion also applies to systems where su-\nperconductivity is related to mechanisms other than the\nelectron-phonon coupling. For electron-electron pairing,\nTc depends on the Fermi energy EF and is on the or-\n\nder of about EF\n\n102 [63, 78]. EF \u221d ~2\n\nmea2B\n\u221d mee\n\n4\n\n~2 and\n\ndepends on fundamental constants as ER in Eq. (2)\ndoes. Hence, Tc in the electron-electron systems such\nas cuprates also depends on on fundamental constants as\nit is in the electron-phonon superconductors.\n\nNoting that the upper limit to EF is set by ER in\nEq. (2) and recalling that Tc in the electron-electron sys-\ntems is on the order of EF\n\n102 [63, 78], we observe that the\nupper bound to Tc in these systems is close to Tuc be-\n\ncause C\n(\nme\n\nmp\n\n) 1\n2\n\nin Eq. (8) with C \u2248 0.1 is on the order\n\nof about 1\n102 .\n\nC. Fundamental constants and search for\nroom-temperature superconductivity\n\nHaving seen that the overall scale of Tuc is set by fun-\ndamental physical constants, we now ask the important\nquestion of what would be the effects of fundamental con-\nstants having different values. This question is intensely\nresearched in high-energy physics and astrophysics and\nis related to fine-tuning of the Universe and associated\ngrand challenges in modern science [1\u201310]. How would\nsuperconductivity change were fundamental constants\n(e.g., ~, me, e and me\n\nmp\nin Eq. (8)) to take different val-\n\nues? This question is well-posed because it is possible to\nchange Tuc in Eq. (8) by varying ~, me, e and mp while\n\nkeeping \u03b2 = me\n\nmp\nand \u03b1 = e2\n\n~c unchanged and hence main-\n\ntain the rest of essential processes (e.g. those involved\nin stellar formation and evolution, synthesis of heavy el-\nements, stability of ordered structures and so on) intact\n[1].\n\nWe observe that were different fundamental constants\nto give Tuc on the order of, for example, 10\u22126 K or lower,\nsuperconductivity would be unobserved. Were different\nfundamental constants to give Tuc on the order 106 K,\n\nmany superconductors would have Tc in excess of 300\nK. Consistent with Eqs. (8)-(9) giving Tuc on the order\nof 102 \u2212 103 K due to currently observed fundamental\nconstants, we observe superconductivity in the temper-\nature range T . 100-200 K. This understandably stimu-\nlates the current research into finding systems with Tc of\n300 K and above.\n\nTherefore, the very existence of the current line of en-\nquiry to identify systems with Tc above 300 K is itself\ndue to the values of fundamental constants currently ob-\nserved.\n\nV. FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS AND\nOBSERVABILITY OF PHENOMENA IN\n\nCONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS\n\nThe discussion in the previous section implies that fun-\ndamental constants can affect observability of an entire\ncondensed matter phenomenon such as superconductiv-\nity. This implication is wider than what was discussed in\nearlier work [12\u201316, 18\u201328, 31] where fundamental con-\nstants were shown to set a bound on a property (e.g.,\nviscosity, thermal conductivity, diffusivity, or speed of\nsound) which is already observed.\n\nThe observability of superconductivity as a result of\ncurrent values of fundamental constants can be extended\nmore generally to the observability of other phenomena\nand phase transitions. Indeed, different fundamental con-\nstants substantially increasing \u03c9u\n\nm in Eq. (4) would result\nin T \ufffd ~\u03c9m and hence T \ufffd ~\u03c9D (\u03c9D is Debye frequency)\nat typical planetary temperatures. This would result in\nthe solid properties being always quantum and the clas-\nsical regime T > ~\u03c9D unobservable. This would also\nsuppress or arrest second-order structural phase tran-\nsitions because of the smallness of the phonon entropy\n\nS \u221d\n(\n\nT\n~\u03c9D\n\n)3\n\nwhen T \ufffd ~\u03c9D [79].\n\nAnother example is the first-order melting transition\nwhere melting temperature and characteristic slopes of\nthe pressure-temperature melting lines are set by funda-\nmental constants [30]. This implies that different values\nof these constants would result in melting either (a) al-\nways taking place at typical planetary conditions and no\nsolids existing or (b) being unobservable (in this case, the\nice melting temperature would be above typical planetary\ntemperatures implying no water-based life).\n\nLinking the discussion in the previous paragraph and\nin Section IV C, we note that current fundamental con-\nstants enable diverse phenomena such as water-based life\nand superconductivity.\n\nThis and similar future discussion deepen our under-\nstanding of how fundamental constants affect observabil-\nity of entire new phenomena at condensed matter length\nand energy scales. This helps to fill the large gap [14]\nbetween the scales involved in nuclear physics and astro-\nphysics where fundamental constants were shown to give\nrise to different key effects such as the stability of nuclei,\n\nPage 6 of 9AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - JPCM-124400.R1\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60 A\n\ncc\nep\n\nte\nd \n\nM\nan\n\nus\ncr\n\nip\nt\n\n\n\n7\n\nstar formation, and heavy nuclei synthesis [1\u20139]. Ob-\nservability of each effect and phenomenon imposes con-\nstraints on fundamental constants [1]. Discussing differ-\nent constraints along a continuous path of length and en-\nergy scales, including condensed matter scales, is likely\nto bring about new insights into understanding funda-\nmental constants.\n\nThere may be a sense in which bounds to different\nproperties and observability of phenomena can be ex-\npected to be related to fundamental constants on general\ngrounds. We add two remarks in this regard. First, it is\nimportant to show how and why this happens. Indeed,\none view holds that the essence of a physical theory is to\nprovide a relationship between different physical proper-\nties and experimental outcomes [80]. Our current discus-\nsion provides such relationships, including the relation-\nship between bounds on vibration frequency, Tc, observ-\nability of phase transitions on one hand and fundamen-\ntal constants on the other hand. Second, it is not clear\napriori whether bounds can be expressed solely in terms\nof fundamental constants: recently discussed bounds de-\npend on the combination of fundamental constants and\nexternal parameters such as temperature [18, 21\u201326]. On\nthe other hand, our bound on oscillation frequency (4)\nsolely depends on fundamental constants. This is a more\ngeneral and interesting result. This is particularly so in\nview that phenomena such as superconductivity, phase\ntransitions and so on involve many-body collective ef-\nfects which are considered as emergent and not reducible\nto fundamental constants (see Introduction).\n\nVI. SUMMARY\n\nIn summary, we have shown that fundamental physical\nconstants set the upper limit to the vibrational frequency\nof atoms in condensed (non-molecular) systems. This\nbound is in agreement with simulations of atomic hy-\ndrogen and high-temperature superconducting hydrides.\nWe have also proposed that fundamental constants set\nthe upper limit to the superconducting critical temper-\nature on the order of 102\u2013103 K. This implies that the\ncurrent line of enquiry to discover superconductors above\n300 K is itself due to the observed values of fundamental\nconstants. This has led us to observing that fundamen-\ntal constants affect the observability of entire new effects\nand phenomena in condensed matter physics.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nB.M. acknowledges funding from a UKRI Future Lead-\ners Fellowship [MR/V023926/1], from the Gianna An-\ngelopoulos Programme for Science, Technology, and In-\nnovation, and from the Winton Programme for the\nPhysics of Sustainability.

OPTIMIZATION OF THE\nELIASHBERG FUNCTION\n\nIn isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory, \u03bb is a functional\nof the Eliashberg function \u03b12F (\u03c9), specifically\n\n\u03bb[\u03b12F ] = 2\n\n\u222b\n\u03b12F (\u03c9)\n\n\u03c9\nd\u03c9. (11)\n\nThe critical temperature is obtained by solution of\nthe Eliashberg equations [75], whose only inputs are\nthe Eliashberg function and a value for the Coulomb\npseudopotential \u00b5\u2217. We can therefore write Tc =\nTc[\u03b1\n\n2F ](\u00b5\u2217), a functional of \u03b12F and a function of \u00b5\u2217.\nWe can obtain an upper bound for the critical tempera-\n\nture by extremizing Tc[\u03b1\n2F (\u03c9)](\u00b5\u2217) over a set of sensible\n\n\u03b12F functions, for a typical value of \u00b5\u2217 = 0.125. We\nnote that \u03b12F (\u03c9) can not extend beyond the maximum\nphonon frequency in the system: \u03b12F (\u03c9 > \u03c9m) = 0. For\na finite \u03bb value, \u03b12F (\u03c9) must also smoothly approach 0 as\n\u03c9 \u2192 0. Finally, \u03b12F (\u03c9) must be positive. These form our\nconditions for a sensible Eliashberg function. As noted in\nthe main text, \u03bb is naturally limited to \u03bb \u223c 1\u2212 2 by in-\nstabilities. To calculate an upper bound, we therefore fix\n\u03bb = 2. For the function space F containing \u03b12F , we can\nconstruct a map M : F \u2192 F whose image space satisfies\nthese constraints on \u03b12F . That is to say, \u2200f \u2208 F ,\n\n\u03bb[M(f)] = 2, (12)\n\nM(f)(\u03c9) \u2265 0 \u2200\u03c9, (13)\n\nlim\n\u03c9\u2192\u03c9m\n\nM(f)(\u03c9) = 0, (14)\n\nlim\n\u03c9\u21920\n\nM(f)(\u03c9) = 0.

(J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, in press). I\u2019ll first summarize the motivation and main findings, then walk through the derivations, computational methods, and broader consequences.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Motivation and Context\n\n1. **Role of Fundamental Constants in Physics.** \n   - It is well-understood that fundamental physical constants (e.g., the speed of light \\(c\\), Planck\u2019s constant \\(\\hbar\\), electron charge \\(e\\), electron mass \\(m_e\\), proton mass \\(m_p\\), and so on) play pivotal roles in particle physics and astrophysics. Classic examples include stellar formation, fusion processes, nuclear stability, and heavy-element synthesis.  \n   - Over the last decade, research has also revealed that certain upper or lower bounds in condensed matter can be set by combinations of fundamental constants. Examples include lower bounds on viscosity, upper bounds on the speed of sound, and minimal thermal conductivity in insulators.\n\n2. **Upper Bound on Phonon Frequencies.** \n   - In crystalline or non-crystalline solids, atoms vibrate with characteristic frequencies known as phonons. The highest of these frequencies (often near the Debye frequency) determines many thermodynamic and transport properties.  \n   - The question the authors ask is: \u201cIs there a theoretical maximum phonon frequency for atomic vibrations in condensed phases, and if so, can it be expressed purely in terms of fundamental constants?\u201d\n\n3. **Implications for Superconductivity.**  \n   - A fundamental limit on the highest phonon frequency would directly impact phonon-mediated superconductivity, because superconducting critical temperature \\(T_c\\) in conventional, electron-phonon-driven superconductors is roughly proportional to certain averages of the phonon frequencies.  \n   - Consequently, identifying an upper frequency cap places a ceiling on how large \\(T_c\\) can become in phonon-based superconductors (e.g., H\\(_3\\)S, LaH\\(_{10}\\), CaH\\(_6\\), etc.).  \n   - Interestingly, they argue that even for non-phonon pairing mechanisms (e.g., electron-electron pairing in cuprates), fundamental constants still indirectly impose a broad upper limit.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Main Results\n\n### 2.1 Upper Bound on the Maximum Phonon Frequency\n\n- **Derivation of the bound.**  \n  The starting point is the approximate relationship for a non-molecular condensed phase in which each atom of mass \\(m\\) vibrates with some highest energy scale \\(E\\) set by chemical bonding. Roughly, one can view the maximum phonon frequency \\(\\omega_m\\) as\n  \\[\n    \\hbar\\omega_m \\;\\sim\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{m\\,a^2}}\\,a^2\n    \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{m}},\n  \\]\n  where \\(a\\) is an interatomic spacing and \\(E\\) a bonding energy. They then use:\n  1. The Bohr radius \\(a_B\\) sets a basic lower-limit to atomic separations in dense phases.\n  2. The Rydberg energy \\(E_R\\approx 13.6\\,\\text{eV}\\) is an upper scale for typical electronic bonding.  \n\n  Substituting \\(m\\rightarrow m_p\\) (proton mass, relevant for the lightest possible atom) and \\(E \\rightarrow E_R\\) yields (dropping numerical factors of order unity):\n  \\[\n    \\hbar \\omega_m \n    \\;\\sim\\; E_R\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{m_e}{m_p}}\n    \\;\\approx\\; 3680\\,\\text{K}.\n  \\]\n  Written more explicitly, they obtain:\n  \\[\n    \\omega_m^{u} \\;=\\;\n    \\frac{1}{32\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0^2}\\;\\frac{m_e e^4}{\\hbar^3}\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{m_e}{m_p}}\n    \\;\\sim\\; 3680\\,\\text{K}.\n  \\]\n  - This numerical value, \\(\\sim 3000\\!-\\!4000\\,\\text{K}\\) (when expressed as a temperature equivalent), is the \u201cfundamental bound\u201d on the maximum phonon frequency for non-molecular condensed phases at **zero pressure**.\n\n- **Effect of high pressure.**  \n  Hydrogen only becomes a dense atomic crystal above \\(\\sim\\!400\\) GPa. To account for additional energy contributions under large pressure \\(P\\), one includes \\(P\\,V\\) in the energy budget. The authors show that a notional correction raises the zero-pressure bound slightly when \\(P\\) is large, but never so dramatically as to exceed \\(\\sim\\!5000$\u2013$6000\\,\\text{K}\\) in the extreme. This means that even under huge pressures, the fundamental bound does not jump to extremely large frequencies.\n\n- **DFT calculations confirm the bound.**  \n  They directly test the maximum phonon frequency for atomic metallic hydrogen (the lightest possible dense phase) via **density functional theory** (DFT) at various pressures (400\u20131000 GPa).  \n  - The *calculated* maximum frequency in atomic hydrogen at 400 GPa is just above 3600 K, indeed right below the predicted fundamental bound. \n  - They also examine hydrogen-rich hydrides (H\\(_3\\)S, LaH\\(_{10}\\), CaH\\(_6\\), MgIrH\\(_6\\), etc.) because these systems have very high phonon frequencies. Their maximum frequencies stay below or around the same 3000\u20134000 K corridor, in accord with the theoretical limit.\n\n- **Molecular solids can have \u2018vibron\u2019 modes** exceeding the typical bond energies, but the authors note that even for H\\(_2\\) molecules, the highest intra-molecular modes remain \\(\\lesssim\\!6200\\)\u2013\\(6400\\,\\text{K}\\). Thus if one wants to unify the bound so that it also accommodates \u201cmolecular vibron\u201d modes, they propose doubling the figure (\\(\\approx 7360\\,\\text{K}\\)) to cover that special case. Nonetheless, for *non-molecular* condensed matter phases, \\(\\sim 3000$\u2013$4000\\,\\text{K}\\) stands as the robust figure.\n\n### 2.2 Implications for Superconductivity\n\n- **Conventional electron-phonon mechanisms.**  \n  In standard Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theory, the superconducting transition temperature \\(T_c\\) scales roughly with an average phonon frequency \\(\\omega\\):\n  \\[\n    T_c \\approx \\; C \\;\\omega,\n  \\]\n  where \\(C\\) is a function of the electron-phonon coupling \\(\\lambda\\), Coulomb pseudopotential \\(\\mu^*\\), and other details.  \n  - Empirically and theoretically, there is a limit to how large \\(\\lambda\\) can become before the system becomes unstable. With typical \\(\\lambda \\approx 1$\u2013$2\\) near the threshold of lattice instabilities, the coefficient \\(C\\) is not extremely large (\\(\\sim 0.1$\u2013$0.3\\)).\n  - Consequently, if \\(\\omega\\) cannot exceed \\(\\omega_m^u\\sim 3000$\u2013$4000\\,\\text{K}\\), there is an ultimate upper bound on \\(T_c\\), typically on the order of a few hundred Kelvin:\n    \\[\n      T_c^u \\;=\\; C\\,\\omega_m^u \\;\\sim\\; 10^2\\!-\\!10^3\\,\\text{K}.\n    \\]\n\n- **Numerical optimization of the Eliashberg function.**  \n  The paper supports that statement with a direct optimization:  \n  1. They impose the maximum frequency cutoff \\(\\omega_m^u\\).  \n  2. They fix \\(\\lambda\\) to a high yet physically acceptable value (e.g. \\(\\lambda=2\\)).  \n  3. They numerically vary the shape of the Eliashberg spectral density \\(\\alpha^2F(\\omega)\\) to maximize the solution of the ME equations for \\(T_c\\).  \n  4. The solution converges to \\(T_c \\sim 600\\,\\text{K}\\) for that scenario, right in the 300\u20131000 K region predicted analytically.\n\n- **Non-phonon mechanisms.**  \n  Even for unconventional superconductors (e.g. cuprates, with electron-electron pairing), the Fermi energy \\(E_F\\) can serve as the fundamental energy scale, and \\(E_F\\) also ultimately depends on fundamental constants such as \\(\\hbar\\), \\(m_e\\), and \\(e^2/(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0)\\). This again leads to a broad limiting scale for \\(T_c\\).  \n\n### 2.3 Observability of Phenomena and Broader Consequences\n\n- **Were constants different...**  \n  They remark that if the dimensionless mass ratio \\(\\beta=m_e/m_p\\) or other fundamental constants were drastically different, the maximum phonon frequency might be too high or too low relative to ambient temperatures. Hence:\n  - If \\(\\omega_m^u \\) were tiny, one would never observe superconductivity above micro-K temperatures, making it effectively unobservable in normal planetary contexts.  \n  - If \\(\\omega_m^u \\) were extremely large, we could have stable superconductors at millions of Kelvin, or no stable condensed phases at typical conditions.  \n\n- **Phase transitions, melting, and more.**  \n  The authors propose that fundamental constants shape not only superconductivity but also whether certain phase transitions (classical vs. quantum) can occur at planetary temperatures. For instance, if the Debye frequency in solids is always far above typical thermal energies, the atomic vibrations would remain quantum-mechanical under all usual conditions, and classical (entropy-driven) transitions might vanish or become unobservable.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Methods Overview\n\n1. **Density Functional Theory (DFT).**  \n   - Uses the plane-wave code *CASTEP*, with exchange-correlation approximations (PBE functional).  \n   - High cutoffs (e.g. 1200 eV) and dense \\(\\mathbf{k}\\)-point sampling to achieve good convergence for high-pressure hydrides and hydrogen.  \n   - Pressure is adjusted until the target structure (e.g., the atomic I4\\(_1\\)/amd phase of hydrogen, or various superhydride structures) reaches stable pressure within \\(<10^{-4}\\) GPa.  \n   - Phonons are computed via the finite-displacement method or by computing force-constant matrices in suitably sized supercells.\n\n2. **Migdal-Eliashberg Calculations.**  \n   - They solve the isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations, using the spectral function \\(\\alpha^2F(\\omega)\\) as the primary input.  \n   - They fix the electron-phonon coupling \\(\\lambda\\) to typical large values (1\u20132) then vary the shape of \\(\\alpha^2F(\\omega)\\) under the constraint that the phonon frequencies cannot exceed \\(\\omega_m^u\\).  \n   - The maximum possible \\(T_c\\) for that family of functions sets the theoretical ceiling.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Significance and Implications\n\n1. **Establishing a \u201cFundamental Cap\u201d on Phonon Frequencies.**  \n   The main conceptual takeaway is that *if you try to maximize atomic vibrational frequencies in stable, non-molecular condensed matter, you still hit a limit that is purely set by \\(\\hbar,\\,m_e,\\,m_p,\\,e\\), etc.*. Numerically, this is a few thousand Kelvin at zero pressure.\n\n2. **Upper Bound on Superconducting \\(T_c\\).**  \n   With that cap in place, the highest \\(\\omega\\)-based superconductor can only reach a \\(T_c\\) in the few-hundred Kelvin range\u2014plausibly up to a bit above room temperature (300\u2013400 K, maybe a few hundred K more), but not thousands of Kelvin.  \n   - This clarifies why present-day searches for room-temperature superconductors (like hydrides at high pressure) are \u201cwithin range\u201d but are not likely to leap to thousands-of-Kelvin superconductors.\n\n3. **Connection to Universality and Fine-Tuning.**  \n   This paper extends an anthropic/fine-tuning narrative to condensed matter: *the Universe\u2019s choice* of \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\hbar\\), etc., not only sets up nuclear and stellar phenomena but also delimits whether high-\\(T_c\\) superconductivity can exist at or above everyday temperatures.\n\n4. **Future Directions.**  \n   - More systematic study of bounding \\(\\lambda\\) and how that interacts with \\(\\omega_{\\mathrm{max}}\\).  \n   - Examination of whether \u201cexotic\u201d superconducting mechanisms might circumvent the frequency bound\u2014though the authors argue fundamental constants would still appear in the relevant energy scales.  \n   - Linking other phases or transitions (melting lines, quantum vs. classical transitions) to fundamental constants in a unified picture that spans nuclear scales, condensed matter, and astrophysics.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of the Paper\u2019s Contribution\n\n- **They analytically derive** an upper limit on \\(\\omega_m\\) (the maximum phonon frequency) purely from fundamental constants, anchored by the electron-to-proton mass ratio \\(m_e/m_p\\) and the Rydberg energy scale.  \n- **They confirm** this limit using ab initio calculations of atomic hydrogen (the lightest possible element, which should maximize phonon frequencies at high pressures) and also check a range of hydrogen-rich superhydrides.  \n- **They then use** the conventional Migdal-Eliashberg framework (plus an instability-based argument that \\(\\lambda\\) cannot grow arbitrarily large) to show that the maximum superconducting temperature \\(T_c\\) must lie in the broad range of a few hundred Kelvin (roughly \\(100\\!-\\!1000\\,\\mathrm{K}\\)). Numerically, they find \\(\\sim 600\\,\\mathrm{K}\\) is achievable only if one pushes all spectral weight to the highest allowed frequencies.  \n- **They discuss** how a different set of fundamental constants could have trivialized or precluded the search for room-temperature (or higher) superconductivity, underscoring that *the search for 300 K superconductivity is itself possible because of the particular fundamental constants we observe*.\n\nIn short, the paper\u2019s core message is that fundamental constants not only set familiar high-energy or nuclear thresholds but also impose a universal limit to atomic vibration speeds and, by extension, a universal upper bound on phonon-mediated superconducting \\(T_c\\). This applies across dense matter, especially for hydrogen-based or hydrogen-dominant superconductors that aim for the highest \\(T_c\\). It thereby provides a \u201cfundamental lens\u201d on today\u2019s pursuit of room-temperature superconductivity in superhydrides and beyond."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"13e743e6-f99c-4743-989a-f169efa6083c","request_id":"91c1f63f6d5544c0-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"13e743e6-f99c-4743-989a-f169efa6083c","children":["21db7484-cc1e-4195-b527-532e40c74668"]},"21db7484-cc1e-4195-b527-532e40c74668":{"id":"21db7484-cc1e-4195-b527-532e40c74668","message":{"id":"21db7484-cc1e-4195-b527-532e40c74668","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1741265739.113,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Do these finding open the door to the possibility of having a maximum superconducting temp around room temperature, under normal atmospheric pressure?

Below are some key avenues in which AI can help push these boundaries:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Structure Prediction and Materials Screening**\n\n1. **High-throughput search**  \n   - Superconductors at high pressure or with intricate structures can exist in enormous compositional and structural \u201cphase spaces.\u201d AI/ML tools can guide and accelerate exploration of these spaces.  \n   - By mapping chemical composition, potential stoichiometries, and structural parameters into model predictions (e.g., predicted enthalpy of formation or superconducting descriptors), AI can rapidly filter out unpromising candidates, leaving a smaller subset for more expensive calculations or experiments.\n\n2. **Crystal structure search**  \n   - Classical methods such as random structure searching or evolutionary algorithms (CALYPSO, USPEX, etc.) can be enhanced with AI-based heuristics.  \n   - Reinforcement-learning approaches can iteratively propose candidate structures, learn from each attempt, and direct the search more intelligently than purely random sampling.\n\n3. **Generative models**  \n   - Deep generative models (variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks) can learn global features of known superconductors and then \u201cgenerate\u201d novel candidate materials.  \n   - This approach can be combined with theoretical constraints (e.g., charge neutrality, realistic atomic sizes) to propose physically plausible new compounds.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Accelerating Ab Initio Calculations**\n\n1. **ML Surrogates**  \n   - Density functional theory (DFT) and Migdal-Eliashberg calculations are computationally expensive, especially for large supercells.  \n   - Machine-learned surrogate models can approximate energies, phonon spectra, electron-phonon coupling parameters, and other key quantities with much lower computational cost once trained on a modest set of quantum calculations.\n\n2. **Active Learning and Bayesian Optimization**  \n   - By iteratively training ML models on the most \u201cinformative\u201d data points\u2014selected using an \u201cacquisition function\u201d that searches for high uncertainty or high predicted \\(T_c\\)\u2014AI can zero in on high-value materials with fewer expensive ab initio runs.\n\n3. **Inverse Design**  \n   - In \u201cinverse design,\u201d one specifies target properties (e.g., a certain superconducting transition temperature or a minimal required electron-phonon coupling) and then uses ML-based optimization to propose chemical/structural configurations that match those properties.  \n   - This approach moves beyond brute-force scanning and directly aims to achieve a high \\(T_c\\) under specific constraints, such as ambient pressure stability.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Data-Driven Insights into Superconductivity**\n\n1. **Pattern recognition in existing databases**  \n   - Large materials databases (e.g., the Materials Project, OQMD, and superconductor-focused repositories) contain a wealth of experimental and computed results.  \n   - AI can detect subtle correlations among chemical composition, crystal structure, electron band topology, phonon dispersions, and observed \\(T_c\\). These correlations may be too subtle for straightforward \u201chuman\u201d inspection but can reveal valuable design heuristics.\n\n2. **Explainable AI methods**  \n   - Beyond black-box predictions, \u201cexplainable\u201d AI techniques (SHAP values, feature-attribution methods, etc.) can highlight which structural or chemical features most affect predicted \\(T_c\\).  \n   - This can help guide researchers toward specific design motifs or doping strategies, shedding light on the underlying physics.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Discovery of New Superconducting Mechanisms**\n\n1. **Unconventional superconductors**  \n   - While phonon-driven pairing is well-described by Migdal-Eliashberg theory, many high-\\(T_c\\) superconductors (e.g. cuprates, iron pnictides) involve more complex mechanisms. AI can capture correlations in multi-orbital or strongly correlated systems by learning from data (experimental or high-level quantum approaches).  \n   - Large-scale ML analyses might detect patterns in doping phase diagrams, spin-fluctuation spectra, or electronic instabilities that precede superconductivity.\n\n2. **Automated literature analysis**  \n   - Text-mining and natural-language processing can help synthesize the vast superconductivity literature, highlighting overlooked compounds, extracting experimental conditions, or inferring \u201chidden\u201d patterns from thousands of articles and patents.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Automated Experimentation and Robotics**\n\n1. **Robotic synthesis**  \n   - \u201cSelf-driving\u201d labs integrate AI with robotic materials synthesis and characterization.  \n   - An AI agent proposes a new composition and synthesis pathway, the robot fabricates and measures it, and the AI then updates its model. This closed-loop approach can rapidly converge on target superconducting phases or doping levels.  \n\n2. **Accelerated characterization**  \n   - Rapid scanning of temperature- or pressure-dependent properties, combined with real-time machine-learning analysis, can identify signals of superconductivity and optimize conditions for sample preparation.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Challenges and Outlook**\n\n- **Accuracy and Transferability.**  \n  - ML models remain only as good as their training data. For truly novel, complex materials (e.g., those far outside known chemistries), the model might extrapolate poorly.  \n- **Balancing speed and reliability.**  \n  - AI can propose thousands of candidates, but validating them\u2014experimentally or via advanced theory\u2014takes time and resources. Careful synergy between rapid ML screening and rigorous ab initio or experimental validation is crucial.\n- **Interpreting AI discoveries.**  \n  - Especially in unconventional superconductors, a big challenge is *why* a certain structure is predicted to have a high \\(T_c\\). Combined \u201cexplainable AI + theory\u201d helps solidify those insights into new design principles.\n\nDespite these challenges, AI-based techniques are already speeding up the pace of superconductivity research. They can systematically scour massive chemical spaces, automate lab tasks, and unveil hidden correlations in data. Together with continued advances in high-throughput experimentation, large-scale HPC, and fundamental theory, AI may well guide us toward ambient-pressure superconductors with transition temperatures near or even above room temperature\u2014fulfilling a longstanding materials science goal."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"1da7c94a-3d5e-45b2-84b0-e713e1fae8a4","request_id":"91ca35c81fa26bca-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1da7c94a-3d5e-45b2-84b0-e713e1fae8a4","children":["2e2a2ead-a820-492d-8799-53edfe9cf989"]},"2e2a2ead-a820-492d-8799-53edfe9cf989":{"id":"2e2a2ead-a820-492d-8799-53edfe9cf989","message":{"id":"2e2a2ead-a820-492d-8799-53edfe9cf989","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1741586747.919,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Is the following writeup an accurate synopsis of the paper?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nScientists suggest the upper limit for room temperature superconductivity\r\nSuperconductors are known for existing at freezing temperatures, but they also have a hidden upper limit that includes room temperature.\r\n\r\nSuperconductors are game-changing materials that can transform everything, ranging from healthcare to energy transmission and quantum computing. But there\u2019s a catch\u2014they work at extremely low temperatures (close to absolute zero).\r\n\r\nThis limitation has prevented us from harnessing their full potential. To address this challenge, scientists have been actively working on developing room-temperature superconductors, but they often wonder \u2014 is there an upper temperature limit for superconductivity?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is crucial to determining whether superconductivity can truly exist at room temperature. For instance, if a theoretical upper limit exists below room temperature, then achieving room-temperature superconductivity would be fundamentally impossible.\r\n\r\nFinally, a team of researchers from Queen Mary University of London has found the answer. In their new study, they reveal the factors affecting the upper limit and the maximum temperature range suitable for superconductivity.\r\n\r\nThe study authors shed light on the role of fundamental physical constants\u2014such as electron mass, Planck\u2019s constant (h), electron charge, and the fine-structure constant (\u03b1). \r\n\r\nIt is already known that these constants \u201cgovern everything from the stability of atoms to the formation of stars and synthesis of carbon and other elements essential to life.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor instance, in any solid, atoms oscillate around fixed positions due to thermal energy. The speed of these vibrations depends on two key factors: bond strength and atomic mass. Both these factors are determined by quantum mechanics and electromagnetism, which are governed by fundamental constants.\r\n\r\nBy analyzing how these constants influence atomic interactions, the study authors discovered that the constants place a strict upper limit on how fast atoms can vibrate in solid materials. This means there is a maximum possible frequency for phonons, which are the collective vibrations of atoms in a material.\r\n\r\nIn many superconductors, phonons play a crucial role in pairing up electrons (Cooper pairs), enabling superconductivity. The frequency of phonons affects the strength of this pairing and, in turn, determines the highest possible temperature (TC) at which superconductivity can occur. \r\n\r\nSince fundamental constants impose an upper limit on phonon frequencies, they also place a theoretical constraint on how high TC can be in superconductors. This means that \u201cthe upper limit of superconducting temperature TC is intrinsically linked to the fundamental constants of nature \u2013 the electron mass, electron charge, and the Planck constant,\u201d the study authors note.\r\n\r\nUsing the fundamental constants, the study authors determined that superconductivity can exist between a temperature of 100 Kelvin to 1000 Kelvin; this upper limit range for TC includes standard room temperature values that lie between 293 K to 298 K (20 to 25\u00b0C).\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fact that room-temperature superconductivity is theoretically possible, given our Universe\u2019s constants, is encouraging. It\u2019s a call to keep exploring, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible,\u201d the researchers said."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"91e09f858d596bab-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a29225da-fca6-45fa-a56e-1668eeb0f338","children":["a6ce38f1-d8fe-47fc-aa0c-eb5791e297ed"]},"a6ce38f1-d8fe-47fc-aa0c-eb5791e297ed":{"id":"a6ce38f1-d8fe-47fc-aa0c-eb5791e297ed","message":{"id":"a6ce38f1-d8fe-47fc-aa0c-eb5791e297ed","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1741586757.372517,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Evaluating clarity and simplicity\n\nRevising existence parameters.

Overall, you capture much of the spirit correctly\u2014especially regarding the existence of an upper limit on phonon frequencies and the consequent theoretical ceiling on superconducting \\(T_c\\). However, there are a few important nuances or clarifications worth mentioning:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Overall Faithfulness\n\n- **Correct Emphasis on Fundamental Constants.**  \n  Your summary accurately states that fundamental constants (e.g., electron mass, Planck\u2019s constant, electron charge, etc.) impose a strict upper bound on phonon frequencies. Since phonons in conventional superconductors mediate Cooper pairing, that bound translates into an upper limit on the superconducting transition temperature \\(T_c\\).  \n\n- **Inclusion of Room Temperature.**  \n  You note that this theoretical limit (roughly 100\u20131000\u202fK) *does* include ambient (room) temperatures. That is consistent with the paper\u2019s conclusion that there is *no* fundamental prohibition preventing superconductivity from appearing at around 300\u202fK\u2014i.e., the paper\u2019s predicted upper bound is well above room temperature.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Points That Need Minor Clarification\n\n1. **Mention of the Electron\u2013Proton Mass Ratio.**  \n   - The paper *explicitly* highlights not just \\(\\alpha\\) (the fine-structure constant) and \\(\\hbar\\), \\(e\\), \\(m_e\\), but also the dimensionless ratio \\(\\beta = m_e/m_p\\).  \n   - In fact, \\(\\sqrt{m_e/m_p}\\) plays a central role in deriving the maximum phonon frequency.  \n   - Your synopsis groups \u201cfundamental constants\u201d without calling out \\(\\beta\\). This is not *wrong*, but undersells one of the core takeaways.\n\n2. **Range of 100\u202fK to 1000\u202fK vs. a Single \u201cUpper Limit.\u201d**  \n   - The paper\u2019s analysis is really about an *upper* limit. They find it is on the order of 10^2\u201310^3\u202fK for phonon-driven superconductors (though there is some interplay with electron-phonon coupling \\(\\lambda\\), possible structural instabilities, etc.).  \n   - The synopsis could give a mistaken impression that *both* the lower and upper edges (100\u202fK and 1000\u202fK) follow from fundamental constraints. The real story is that the *upper* boundary sits around several hundred kelvin to possibly 1000\u202fK, and that *encompasses* typical room temperatures. There isn\u2019t a fundamental \u201c100\u202fK lower bound\u201d in the same sense.\n\n3. **Pressures vs. Ambient Conditions.**  \n   - The paper notes that while the upper limit includes room temperature, today\u2019s high-\\(T_c\\) hydride superconductors generally require huge pressures (hundreds of GPa).  \n   - Your text doesn\u2019t explicitly mention that most 200\u202fK+ superconductors discovered so far are far from ambient pressure. The paper does not say it is *impossible* at ambient pressure\u2014it just stresses that stabilizing extremely high phonon frequencies (and strong coupling) under normal pressure remains an unsolved challenge.\n\n4. **Wording: \u201cFinally, they found the answer.\u201d**  \n   - The paper does indeed propose a fundamental upper bound, but it is a theoretical bound with approximate arguments (they use scaling relationships and confirm them with ab initio calculations for hydrogen/hydrides).  \n   - It might be more nuanced to say \u201cthey propose and verify an upper bound\u201d rather than suggest they have found a single, definitive limit that applies in all details without approximation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summary of Accuracy\n\n- Your synopsis is **essentially correct** in portraying:\n  - That there *is* a fundamental upper limit on phonon frequencies tied to basic constants.  \n  - That this, in turn, places a theoretical cap on \\(T_c\\).  \n  - That the cap is high enough to include (and exceed) room temperature.\n\n- The **main refinements** would be:\n  1. Acknowledge the special importance of the electron\u2013proton mass ratio.  \n  2. Clarify that 100\u202fK is not itself a fundamental *minimum* so much as a typical ballpark for existing high-\\(T_c\\) superconductors, whereas the real theoretical result is about an *upper* ceiling of a few hundred to a thousand kelvin.  \n  3. Note that so far, *experimentally* reaching near-ambient pressure at those high temperatures has remained elusive, even if not forbidden by the theory.  \n\nWith these small adjustments, your summary would be a solid, succinct reflection of the paper\u2019s central findings."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"a6ce38f1-d8fe-47fc-aa0c-eb5791e297ed","request_id":"91e09f858d596bab-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a6ce38f1-d8fe-47fc-aa0c-eb5791e297ed","children":[]}}}
