Consulted known tables and searched for best codes to confirm this. Progress is steady and informative.\n\n**Opening the page**\n\nI\u2019m unlocking the Magma database page to find the coordinates [14,10,3] over GF(3).\n\n**Reflecting on dimension k**\n\nI'm considering the ideal dimension k for n=14 with distance 3 and q=3. This involves finding exact values for the calculation.\n\n**Narrowing options**\n\nHm, I'm really digging into the 14x10, q=3 code. It seems the most likely candidate.\n\n**Consulting sources**\n\nI'm inclined to open arXiv for further details.\n\n**Examining constraints**\n\nI'm analyzing the dimensions of the [14,10,3] Hamming code to ensure it meets the optimal bound requirement.\n\n**Checking earlier lines**  \nTaking a closer look at the earlier lines, I'm examining the references to [14,10,3] to ensure they are accurate and contribute meaningfully to the context and flow of the discussion.\n\n**Verifying the prime**\n\nOK, let me see. I'm checking if the prime q=3 fits, since (q^3+1)/(q-1)+1 gives n=14.\n\n**Confirming citation details**\n\nI'm checking the citation near Example 49 to ensure accuracy, as the paper references the specific positioning of (3,3) yielding [14,10,3].\n\n**Reviewing Example 49**\n\nI\u2019m skimming through earlier lines to revisit Example 49 and ensure I haven\u2019t missed any key details. This helps clarify any questions or confusions, making adjustments as needed based on the new insights.\n\n**Examining code optimality**\n\nI'm looking at the code's dimension, trying to figure out if \"optimal\" refers to maximum codeword size or if it aligns with the Singleton bound.\n\n**Analyzing Hamming bound**\n\nI'm mapping out the Hamming bound with q=3 and n=40, verifying if k meets n-3, and confirming if Hamming code [40,36,3] over GF(3) is optimal.\n\n**Examining details**\n\nChecking the [40,36,3] code for \"codetables\". Opening the webpage might provide more context on \"marinade\".\n\n**Navigating a webpage**\n\nI'm piecing together my approach to potentially scrolling through a specific page identified by [40,36,3].\n\n**Assessing accessibility**\n\nEvaluating the accessibility of the codetables page for [40,36,3], focusing on k=36 and n=40. Progress continues as I work through the details.\n\n**Gathering evidence**\n\nI\u2019m noting that the GAP manual's `HammingCode(4, GF(3))` confirms a [40,36,3] Hamming (4,3) code over GF(3), suggesting a counterexample.\n\n**Confirming Hamming code**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together that the q-ary Hamming code adheres to the Hamming bound formula, establishing it as optimal with a dimension of 36.\n\n**Gathering sources**\n\nI am gathering informations on Hamming bound, especially from sites and the GAP manual. This approach helps in compiling the necessary citations effectively.\n\n**Baltic Sea Region Hamming Bound**\n\nOK, let me see. The Hamming bound lines, tied to formulas and visibilities, are crucial for Baltic Sea Region data. Their complexity might demand OpenAI's guidelines for use.\n\n**Highlighting code properties**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together the GF(3) code's characteristics to prove its optimality.
