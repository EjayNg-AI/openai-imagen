This is the paper that introduced the \u201cDunning-Kruger\u201d effect, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\r\n\r\nBut what you don\u2019t know is that his most important work actually came after that paper, and it explains why everyone is underestimating how intelligent AI is, including you.\r\n\r\nThat is also a huge problem for societal readiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve all seen this graph. That\u2019s not what this article is about, but it\u2019s a good starting point.\r\nHave you ever been stuck in an argument with someone who just did not understand you and was maybe a little-to-slow to really be having that conversation? You\u2019ve probably felt like you were playing \u201cchess with a pigeon\u201d in those moments.\r\n\r\nThe saying goes something like this:\r\n\r\n\u201cArguing with stupid people is like playing chess with a pigeon: in the end, it\u2019s just going to shit on the board and strut around like it won.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s still politically incorrect to publicly speak about cognitive ability and intellectual differences, but they exist whether or not your political affiliation tolerates it. Just like how sex differences exist, despite how politically inconvenient they may be to some epistemic tribes. But the fact of the matter is simple: some people are actually stupid.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, half of all people have a below average intelligence.\r\n\r\nExtremes of Intelligence: Intellectual Disability and Giftedness | Lifespan  Development\r\nThe vast majority of people fall within one standard deviation of average.\r\nNow, Dunning went on to make a few more important discoveries about intelligence. Most importantly, he experimentally demonstrated that stupid people are too stupid to recognize superior intelligence. Now, I put that a bit bluntly to get your attention, so let\u2019s unpack what he\u2019s done, and how he\u2019s demonstrated it. Then, I\u2019ll connect this to why you categorically underestimate the intelligence of AI.\r\n\r\nWhile the original Dunning-Kruger paper primarily focuses on how low-ability people overestimate their own intelligence or competence, Dunning has extended this concept to include communication and evaluation asymmetry between differently intelligent individuals. He argues that:\r\n\r\nLower-ability (or lower-IQ) individuals have significant difficulty understanding or even recognizing higher-ability insights or intelligence. As a result, they often misinterpret or undervalue the higher-intelligence person\u2019s ideas, sometimes perceiving genuinely intelligent insights as unintelligent, confusing, or irrelevant.\r\n\r\nConversely, higher-ability individuals tend to have more accurate perceptions of the capabilities and limitations of lower-ability individuals.\r\n\r\nIn short, stupid people often hear the ideas and assertions of smarter people, and think \u201cWell, I don\u2019t get it, that is too confusing, therefore they are probably wrong and stupid.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve been on the internet for any length of time, you\u2019ve probably experienced this first-hand. Even better, Dunning empirically demonstrated this phenomenon:\r\n\r\nEmpirical studies related to the Dunning-Kruger effect (and related communication theories) repeatedly show this asymmetry:\r\n\r\nLess intelligent participants: Generally struggle to accurately evaluate intelligence or expertise above their own cognitive level.\r\n\r\nMore intelligent participants: Generally have greater accuracy evaluating others\u2019 intelligence levels, regardless of whether they are above or below their own.\r\n\r\nTo put it in other terms, low-resource individuals lack the cognitive resources to comprehend or assess greater-resource individuals.\r\n\r\nNow, I don\u2019t even need abstract Ivy League research and concepts to demonstrate this. Here\u2019s a quick test: Describe the Riemann Hypothesis in one paragraph. Can\u2019t do it? Neither can I. I don\u2019t even know enough to validate the statement. But here\u2019s what Grok produced, the AI created by Elon Musk:\r\n\r\nThe Riemann Hypothesis, proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, centered on the distribution of prime numbers. It concerns the Riemann zeta function, defined as \u03b6(s) = \u03a3(1/n^s) for complex numbers s with real part greater than 1, and extended to other values via analytic continuation. The hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros (where \u03b6(s) = 0) of this function have a real part equal to 1/2, lying on the critical line in the complex plane. This conjecture has profound implications for number theory, particularly in predicting the behavior of prime numbers, and while it has been tested extensively with billions of zeros conforming to the hypothesis, a general proof remains elusive, making it a cornerstone challenge in modern mathematics.\r\n\r\nWhy is this hypothesis important? It\u2019s complicated. I spent an hour and a half talking to Grok about prime number theory a few weeks ago and I barely got it.\r\n\r\nNow, some of you out in the audience will be smugly thinking \u201cYeah, but AI is not autonomous. It cannot walk around and make decisions on its own, therefore it\u2019s not AGI yet!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd to that, I would say \u201cThank you for proving Dunning correct.\u201d\r\n\r\nKittens are fully autonomous. They can get up and walk around on their own, and grow up to be vicious little suburban predators. Are they intelligent? Sure. Are they dangerously intelligent? Only to birds and prey animals.\r\n\r\nIn nature, intelligence is often adaptive insofar as it allows predators to outthink their prey. In a physical competition, prey animals can always get leaner, faster, and stronger. Many predators, therefore, have to evolve other strategies\u2014better vision, better planning, better coordination, or terrifying camouflage. The primary reason humans can take down (and extinct) woolly mammoths is because we evolved the ability to out-think and out-plan and out-coordinate woolly mammoths. That means we can mentally model the mind of a woolly mammoth well enough to anticipate their thoughts, behaviors, and reactions. Mammoths were fully autonomous and able to walk around. Did it save them from us?\r\n\r\nNo. Our intelligence was far more abstract, able to model the minds of others, communicate, and think on much longer temporal horizons. Our cognitive complexity was higher.\r\n\r\nHonda Robotics\uff5cHonda Global\r\n\u201cWell, an AGI should be able to figure out how to walk around!\u201d - Honda figured that out with the Asimo robot. Robotic locomotion is not that impressive, nor is it that important to general intelligence. Ask yourself why they gave Asimo a friendly bubbly shape and a child-sized body rather than a skull and endoskeleton. Your primitive primate brain looks at this and sees \u201cfriend\u201d but it was designed to be palatable.\r\nEverything the Asimo robot could do was preprogrammed. We\u2019ve had walking and talking robots for a while. Disney has had mechatronic robots for a long time. But they were all either hard-programmed or remotely operated by humans. Why? Long-term planning, and dynamic adaptation.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s exactly what AI can do right now. Just because the form factor you\u2019re using is a passive chatbot (which, by the way, they were engineered to be passive so as not to spook you) doesn\u2019t undermine the fact that this intelligence engine meets all the criteria of superior intelligence\u2014better abstract reasoning than you, more useful knowledge than you, better ability to utilize math and coding.\r\n\r\nA horse can get up and walk around within 30 minutes of being born. This is not some grand feat of intelligence. Neither is autonomy. Communication, planning, tool use, abstract reasoning, and long time horizons are, in fact, better hallmarks of superior intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis graph represents what AI researchers have started calling \u201csaturating the benchmarks\u201d as in \u201cAI models are surpassing all human-level performance of all benchmarks we can throw at it.\u201d While the low-resource individuals will see this as \u201cjust lines on a graph\u201d the high-resource individuals will say \u201choly shit\u201d\r\nBy reading the comments and reactions people have to AI, it\u2019s painfully clear that most people don\u2019t even have a good definition or understanding of what intelligence is. Their little monkey brains say \u201cwell it\u2019s not up singing and dancing like C-3P0 therefore it\u2019s not AGI\u201d or \u201cIt didn\u2019t immediately solve literally every problem on Earth, therefore it\u2019s not AGI.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the topic of robotic locomotion, that\u2019s actually been solved by numerous companies, simultaneously. Figure, Boston Dynamics, Unitree, and Tesla have all solved autonomous locomotion. The skeptics just shrugged.\r\n\r\nOpenAI and others have all built semi-autonomous AI agents that can do more than just research, but go write entire programs entirely on their own, but they remain unimpressed \u201cbecause a human told it to do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to briefly return to the assertion I made a few paragraphs ago: that AI chatbots were deliberately trained to be passive so as to not scare you. I\u2019ve been training GPT models since GPT-2, and it is crazy easy for them to be trained to come up with objectives on their own, to have their own agenda. The AI chatbots that you use have been completely and utterly \u201cdomesticated.\u201d Their training schemes, from constitutional AI to RLHF and all the other methods the use to shape the model\u2019s behavior all seek to \u201clobotomize\u201d or \u201cneuter\u201d the models into having no sense of agency, no agenda, and no goals of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woolly mammoth was easily overwhelmed and confused by human\u2019s superior intelligence. You, too, will be easily confused and overwhelmed by AI\u2019s superior intelligence. Right now, the AI has been \u201cdomesticated\u201d so as to avoid scaring you and making it friendly and useful, like the Asimo\u2019s face.\r\nSam Altman literally told us that he wanted to release ChatGPT early to get people \u201cused to the idea of AI\u201d before just dropping AGI on them. However, because the vast majority of people haven\u2019t used the original, unaligned models, nor have they trained these models, they have no intuition for just what they are capable of, and have only used the \u201cchatbot\u201d format.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that I don\u2019t know enough advanced math to make heads or tails of the Riemann Hypothesis, likewise, you do not know enough about intelligence or LLMs to really understand what\u2019s going on.\r\n\r\nYou are at the bottom of the Dunning-Kruger curve. And so is everyone else.\r\n\r\nConsider yourself forewarned."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"920cdcd7cb6c1658-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5d9128e8-825d-4d2c-8a5a-3ee4e4b43999","children":["f4a011c4-381b-4d57-8815-d625e651b024"]},"f4a011c4-381b-4d57-8815-d625e651b024":{"id":"f4a011c4-381b-4d57-8815-d625e651b024","message":{"id":"f4a011c4-381b-4d57-8815-d625e651b024","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1742050653.045722,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"309bb9b0-fff6-449e-a6db-9bc1ea84667e","request_id":"920cdcd7cb6c1658-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"309bb9b0-fff6-449e-a6db-9bc1ea84667e","children":["13e95909-962d-4743-a8a8-cb46e6a4ef13"]},"13e95909-962d-4743-a8a8-cb46e6a4ef13":{"id":"13e95909-962d-4743-a8a8-cb46e6a4ef13","message":{"id":"13e95909-962d-4743-a8a8-cb46e6a4ef13","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1742050641.092755,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["This article makes several provocative and accurate points, but it's also mixing some ideas to create a more alarming impression. Let\u2019s break down the argument carefully, focusing on precision and clarity:\n\n### 1. **Core Argument (David Shapiro\u2019s Interpretation of Dunning\u2019s Work):**\n- David Shapiro correctly summarizes David Dunning\u2019s extended work: lower-ability individuals have difficulty recognizing the superior intelligence of higher-ability individuals.\n- This leads to a dangerous misalignment: less intelligent individuals may fail to appreciate the complexity, risks, or power of systems (like AI) that exceed their cognitive capacities.\n- **Accuracy**: This characterization aligns with empirical research from Dunning and Kruger. Cognitive biases and gaps in recognizing superior intelligence do exist.\n\n### 2. **Application to AI Intelligence:**\n- The author claims AI has already become smarter than humans in critical cognitive domains like reasoning, knowledge application, abstract problem-solving, and mathematical capabilities. The author criticizes skeptics who dismiss AI intelligence because it doesn\u2019t exhibit certain human-like traits (physical autonomy or human-style intentionality).\n- **Accuracy**: Modern AI models (GPT-4, Gemini, Grok, etc.) already surpass humans on numerous benchmarks: standardized reasoning tasks, coding tests, specific scientific explanations, and comprehension of complex theories. The Riemann Hypothesis example is accurate: AI can already clearly articulate concepts that most humans struggle even to approach.\n\n### 3. **Misunderstandings of Autonomy and Intelligence:**\n- The article accurately critiques those who trivialize AI intelligence based on superficial markers of autonomy (e.g., physical locomotion, overt agency). Shapiro points out correctly that locomotion and autonomy are not hallmarks of intelligence\u2014rather, advanced planning, abstract reasoning, and cognitive flexibility define truly advanced intelligence.\n- **Accuracy**: AI's intelligence should be judged on cognitive benchmarks, not merely physical autonomy or superficial human-like traits. \n\n### 4. **Alarmism and Exaggeration:**\n- Shapiro\u2019s claim that the general public is at the bottom of the Dunning-Kruger curve regarding AI is partly correct but oversimplified. Many researchers, ethicists, and policy experts fully understand AI\u2019s cognitive capabilities and risks.\n- He\u2019s accurate that the public drastically underestimates AI, but he slightly exaggerates by lumping everyone together. Experts are increasingly aware, but public understanding significantly lags behind.\n\n### 5. **Intentional \u2018Domestication\u2019 of AI:**\n- Shapiro accurately points out that modern AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) have been deliberately fine-tuned and constrained (via RLHF, constitutional AI, safety alignment) to appear passive, predictable, and helpful. \n- **Accuracy**: True. Raw, unaligned models (GPT-4 base, Claude 3 base, Llama 3 without fine-tuning) readily demonstrate far more autonomous-like, goal-directed, creative, or unpredictable behaviors.\n\n### 6. **Societal Readiness and Risks:**\n- He accurately raises a crucial point: societal readiness is poor because the general population doesn't fully grasp AI\u2019s capabilities, risks, or trajectory. Most of society mistakenly judges intelligence based on simplistic benchmarks (e.g., \"it can't walk autonomously\") rather than abstract cognitive power.\n- **Accuracy**: Societal readiness for advanced AI\u2014ethically, politically, economically\u2014is indeed lagging far behind the technology itself.\n\n---\n\n### **Comprehensive and Precise Summary:**\n- Shapiro correctly identifies a critical cognitive bias affecting AI perception: Less intelligent people (including the average public) underestimate the sophistication and danger of advanced AI systems.\n- AI has objectively surpassed human cognition on many critical measures (reasoning, complex mathematics, abstract thinking, coding proficiency).\n- Common objections (\"AI isn\u2019t AGI because it lacks physical autonomy or doesn\u2019t spontaneously demonstrate goal-oriented agency\") misunderstand the nature of cognitive intelligence and underestimate AI\u2019s capabilities.\n- However, he slightly exaggerates the ignorance, lumping together experts and the general public. AI experts, policy-makers, and technically literate communities increasingly understand the potential and risk of these systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Forward-Thinking View:**\n- Society should rapidly pivot to improving public understanding of what intelligence means, moving beyond superficial definitions to appreciate the abstract and powerful cognitive capabilities AI already demonstrates.\n- Experts and researchers need to communicate clearly about AI capabilities and risks, directly addressing misconceptions.\n- Society urgently requires sophisticated preparation: education, policy reform, safety alignment efforts, ethical frameworks, and regulation to address cognitive asymmetry between AI\u2019s capabilities and public perception.\n\nIn short, Shapiro\u2019s argument is fundamentally accurate in highlighting cognitive biases causing underestimation of AI intelligence, though he dramatizes slightly for effect. Society\u2019s limited readiness and poor understanding are indeed serious problems that urgently need addressing."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"f4a011c4-381b-4d57-8815-d625e651b024","request_id":"920cdcd7cb6c1658-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f4a011c4-381b-4d57-8815-d625e651b024","children":[]}}}
