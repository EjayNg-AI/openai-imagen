Literal Meaning\n> \u201cA dog born in a stable will never become a horse.\u201d  \n\u2192 Origin: the idea that one\u2019s birth or nature determines one\u2019s destiny \u2014 that environment or aspiration cannot change one\u2019s innate type.\n\nSo semantically, it\u2019s close to:\n- \u201cBorn low, stay low.\u201d\n- \u201cYou cannot change your nature or origin.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2. Classical Chinese Conceptual Equivalents\nSeveral idioms already convey overlapping ideas:\n\n| Idiom | Literal Meaning | Connotation |\n|-------|----------------|--------------|\n| **\u72d7\u6539\u4e0d\u4e86\u5403\u5c4e** | A dog can\u2019t stop eating feces | Innate nature is unchangeable (pejorative) |\n| **\u6c5f\u5c71\u6613\u6539\uff0c\u672c\u6027\u96be\u79fb** | Rivers and mountains can change, but one\u2019s nature is hard to change | Emphasizes inborn character |\n| **\u9f99\u751f\u9f99\uff0c\u51e4\u751f\u51e4\uff0c\u8001\u9f20\u7684\u513f\u5b50\u4f1a\u6253\u6d1e** | Dragons give birth to dragons, phoenixes to phoenixes; a rat\u2019s son will dig holes | Heredity and class determine fate |\n| **\u79cd\u74dc\u5f97\u74dc\uff0c\u79cd\u8c46\u5f97\u8c46** | Sow melons, get melons; sow beans, get beans | You reap what you sow; lineage/nature determined |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Idiom Construction (Newly Coined)\nIf we wanted to coin a **new idiom** inspired by \u201ca dog born in a stable will never become a horse,\u201d it should have the following structure:\n\n- **Four or six characters**\n- **Parallelism or contrast**\n- **Evocative imagery (animals, nature, etc.)**\n\nProposed forms:\n\n1. **\u72ac\u751f\u53a9\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ec8\u975e\u9a8f\u9a6c**  \n   \u201cA dog born in the stable will never be a steed.\u201d  \n   \u2192 Retains your original imagery; classical tone.\n\n2. **\u72ac\u975e\u9a8f\u9aa8\uff0c\u53a9\u4ea6\u5f92\u7136**  \n   \u201cIf the dog lacks a steed\u2019s bones, the stable is in vain.\u201d  \n   \u2192 Expresses futility of changing nature through environment.\n\n3. **\u72d7\u51fa\u9a6c\u53a9\uff0c\u6027\u96be\u6539\u4e5f**  \n   \u201cA dog from the stable \u2014 its nature remains unchanged.\u201d  \n   \u2192 Mirrors the syntactic rhythm of traditional aphorisms.\n\n4. **\u53a9\u517b\u72ac\uff0c\u7ec8\u975e\u9a6c**  \n   \u201cRaise a dog in the stable \u2014 it still won\u2019t be a horse.\u201d  \n   \u2192 Concise, balanced, fits idiomatic brevity.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Polished Recommendation\nFor elegance, concision, and idiomatic cadence, the best form is:\n\n> **\u53a9\u517b\u72ac\uff0c\u7ec8\u975e\u9a6c** *(Ji\u00f9 y\u01ceng qu\u01cen, zh\u014dng f\u0113i m\u01ce)*  \n> \u201cA dog raised in a stable will never be a horse.\u201d  \n> \u2014 Meaning: One\u2019s birth and nature cannot be altered by environment or aspiration.\n\nIt reads naturally as a modern proverb yet sounds classical enough to pass as an old saying.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Extended Interpretation\n- **Moral**: Environment and imitation cannot transcend inherent nature.  \n- **Sociological reading**: Class or origin limits destiny.  \n- **Philosophical reading**: The essence (\u4f53) outweighs circumstance (\u7528).  \n- **Modern reflection**: Could also serve as a critique of meritocratic myths or social mobility illusions.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **render it in classical Chinese prose style** (e.g. for inclusion in an essay or dialogue) or **in modern Chinese commentary form** (for a philosophical or sociological piece)?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"98cd70696c0dfdee-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"c409d073-c500-4629-aea4-a690ba59378e","turn_exchange_id":"468317ef-1d52-4386-b33d-eba8693043c1","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c409d073-c500-4629-aea4-a690ba59378e","children":[]}}}
