High self\u2011certainty \u2248 the model feels confident. | \u00a73.3 and Eq.\u202f(4). |\n| **Training recipe** | Drop\u2010in replacement of the external reward in Group Relative\u202fPPO (GRPO). Same hyper\u2011parameters, same prompts; only the reward changes. | Algorithm box and Fig.\u202f2 (page\u202f5). |\n| **In\u2011domain performance** | Matches GRPO (which has access to ground\u2011truth answers) on GSM8K and MATH500 while *using zero labeled data*. | Table\u202f1, rows for Qwen\u20113B\u202f+\u202fGRPO vs. +\u202fINTUITOR. |\n| **Out\u2011of\u2011domain generalisation** |          *Significantly* better than GRPO on code\u2011generation tasks (LiveCodeBench, CRUXEval), and boosts instruction\u2011following (AlpacaEval). | Table\u202f1 again. |\n| **Learning dynamics** | Faster early improvement (\u00a75.2), emergence of longer chain\u2011of\u2011thought traces, and resilience to reward hacking when the reward is computed online (Fig.\u202f7\u20138). | Pages\u202f7\u201110. |\n| **Sensitivity / ablations** | Proper KL\u2011penalty is crucial; too weak or too strong hurts transfer performance (Table\u202f3). Works on models from 1.5\u202fB to 14\u202fB with minor recipe tweaks (Appendix\u00a0A). | Pages\u202f10 &\u202f15\u201116. |\n\n---\n\n**2\u202f\u202fWhy the method succeeds on objective reasoning tasks**\n\n1. *Correlation between confidence and correctness.*  \n   On maths/code questions, token\u2011level probabilities are sharply peaked when the next step is logically forced; thus high self\u2011certainty is a useful proxy for being right.\n\n2. *Dense reward.*  \n   Self\u2011certainty is computed at every generation step, giving a smoother learning signal than binary \u201cpass/fail\u201d verifiers.\n\n3. *Process reward, not outcome reward.*  \n   The model is nudged to produce *explanations it trusts*, which accidentally lengthen and structure the reasoning chain \u2013 a behaviour that transfers to other domains.\n\n---\n\n**3\u202f\u202fCan the same idea enhance *subjective* tasks such as creative writing or art?**\n\n| Criterion | Straightforward with INTUITOR? | Analysis |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Clear internal proxy that correlates with quality** | **No** \u2013 for creativity, novelty, emotional resonance, style, originality are *not* captured by \u201chow sure am I about the next token?\u201d. High self\u2011certainty often yields *safe, formulaic* prose. |\n| **Reward signal richness** | Partly \u2013 self\u2011certainty is dense, but it drives the model toward low\u2011entropy outputs (mode\u2011seeking). Creative tasks usually benefit from *higher* entropy and surprise. |\n| **Avoiding degeneration / mode\u2011collapse** | Risk increases. Optimising for confidence alone may converge to clich\u00e9s or repetition (minimal risk on arithmetic tasks, maximal risk in poetry). |\n| **Evaluability** | Human taste varies; there is no universal verifier. RLIF is attractive precisely because it removes human labels, but without *some* external signal the model can\u2019t know whether \u201cinteresting\u201d has been achieved. |\n\n**Bottom line:** *Self\u2011certainty, by itself, is unlikely to reward genuine creativity; but the **RLIF framework** is still valuable if we design better intrinsic signals.*\n\n---\n\n**4\u202f\u202fHow the RLIF concept could be adapted for subjective quality**\n\n| Adaptation | Rough implementation sketch | Expected effect / caveats |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Dual intrinsic rewards**: self\u2011certainty **and** *self\u2011surprise* (negative cert.) | Reward = \u03b1\u202f\u00b7\u202fcertainty\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u03b2\u202f\u00b7\u202fcertainty\u00b2 (concave) or mix KL(U\u2016p) **and** KL(p\u2016U). | Balances coherence and novelty; prevents both babble and dullness. Needs tuning. |\n| **Diversity critics** | Maintain a batch diversity bonus (anti\u2011collapse) or mutual information across beams. | Encourages alternative viewpoints or imagery in stories. |\n| **Style/affect heads** | Add tiny frozen classifiers (sentiment, metre detector, aesthetics) whose outputs become extra intrinsic rewards. Still no *human* labels during RL. | Gives the model multiple internal objectives that correlate better with human taste. Risk: the heads themselves embed earlier human biases. |\n| **Self\u2011play evaluation loops** | Model A writes; model\u00a0B (same weights, different temperature) critiques for originality/evocativeness; scores become rewards. | Similar to debate or reflection; brings in richer signals but can drift without periodic human calibration. |\n| **Hybrid training** | Start with INTUITOR for cheap scaling, then add a lightweight preference\u2011tuning stage on a few thousand human\u2011rated samples. | Keeps costs low while anchoring rewards to actual readers. |\n\n---\n\n**5\u202f\u202fResearch agenda & practical recommendations**\n\n1. **Empirical test**: Fine\u2011tune a medium LLM for short\u2011story writing with three reward variants \u2013 (i) self\u2011certainty only, (ii) self\u2011surprise only, (iii) weighted combo. Human double\u2011blind ratings on creativity will reveal which signal aligns best.\n\n2. **Aesthetic latent probing**: Train a small probe to predict human\u2011rated \u201caesthetic appeal\u201d from hidden states; use its log\u2011odds as an RLIF reward. Compare to certainty\u2011only baseline.\n\n3. **Safety check**: Monitor lexical diversity & entropy across training, plus classifier\u2011based toxicity scores; absence of an external verifier means reward hacking is plausible (offline\u2011annotator collapse shown in Fig.\u202f7 of the paper).\n\n4. **Gradual schedule**: Start with a certainty\u2011heavy phase (to maintain coherence), then anneal toward novelty rewards; analogous to curriculum learning.\n\n5. **Multimodal extension**: For image generation models, an internal discriminator (e.g. CLIP score between prompt and image) can act as verifiable reward; creativity could be encouraged via self\u2011disagreement (image\u2013text round\u2011trip loss).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **INTUITOR proves that purely intrinsic, model\u2011generated signals can *replace* ground\u2011truth rewards for tasks where confidence \u2248 correctness**.  \n- **Creative domains violate that equivalence**: originality often requires *lower* confidence and controlled risk\u2011taking.  \n- **Therefore, self\u2011certainty alone is insufficient, but the RLIF philosophy\u2014\u201clet the model grade itself\u201d\u2011\u2014remains promising** if we craft more suitable internal heuristics (novelty, diversity, stylistic probes) and possibly blend them with a light touch of human feedback.  \n\nPursuing this line could yield scalable, low\u2011cost systems able to *self\u2011improve artistic skill* without requiring vast preference datasets, while still preserving the safeguards learned from INTUITOR\u2019s analyses of reward hacking and KL\u2011regularisation."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":67,"end_ix":88,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Learning to Reason without External Rewards.pdf","id":"file-Ewx6Ho5FGo5M5yrDJJabyz","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":7,"cited_message_id":"ac3f46e3-8c26-446b-bbd6-b4c4203d2b15","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}}],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":67,"end_idx":88,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Learning to Reason without External Rewards.pdf","id":"file-Ewx6Ho5FGo5M5yrDJJabyz","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"ac3f46e3-8c26-446b-bbd6-b4c4203d2b15","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null}],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-pro","default_model_slug":"o3-pro","parent_id":"db9c9fb8-f491-43e1-9c4b-6921bee105b9","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"db9c9fb8-f491-43e1-9c4b-6921bee105b9","children":[]}}}
