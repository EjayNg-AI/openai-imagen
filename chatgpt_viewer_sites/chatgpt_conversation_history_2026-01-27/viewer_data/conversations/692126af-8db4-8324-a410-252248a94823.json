Medical kidney function test Singapore interior\"],\"num_per_query\":1}\ue201\n\n**Why this place works:**  \n- Located at Orchard Boulevard (#05-09 Camden Medical Centre) and Tanjong Pagar (72 Anson Rd, #01-02 Anson House). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- Offers dedicated \u201cKidney Function Test\u201d / renal profile blood & urine panels (e.g., creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urea, electrolytes, urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio) starting from about S$28 net. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- Same-day appointments available, and they note convenient booking via WhatsApp. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- Because you are managing hypertension and medications (\ue200entity\ue202[\"medication\",\"Perindopril\",0]\ue201 + \ue200entity\ue202[\"medication\",\"Amlodipine\",0]\ue201), you qualify as higher risk for renal stress\u2014this lab emphasises that for such risk categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n**What to check when booking:**  \n- Ensure the panel includes **serum creatinine**, **eGFR**, **urea (BUN if applicable)**, and **urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio** (especially relevant for BP & renal monitoring).  \n- Ask about **frequency** of tests recommended for your risk profile (we\u2019ll discuss this shortly).  \n- Confirm how quickly results are returned and how you receive them (email, portal, doctor consult).  \n- Make sure the clinic/lab is comfortable integrating with your GP or specialist (so your medication\u2010tweak context is coherent).  \n- Confirm any fasting or dietary instructions (since your BP meds and renal markers could be influenced by hydration / protein intake).  \n\n---\n\n## Why this testing matters with your BP meds  \nGiven you\u2019re on Perindopril (an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor) and Amlodipine (a calcium-channel blocker), and gradually adjusting them, here are key renal-function / biomarker considerations:\n\n- ACE inhibitors (like Perindopril) can affect renal perfusion, especially if kidney function is already impaired; monitoring **creatinine** and **eGFR** will help detect if the kidneys are being challenged. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- Hypertension itself is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD); in fact, renal screening is recommended annually (or more frequently) for people with hypertension. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- The urine microalbumin/creatinine test flags early kidney damage (protein leak) even before large jumps in creatinine\u2014valuable since you\u2019re proactively tweaking meds and want early detection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Suggested monitoring schedule  \nAs you\u2019re in a transition phase with your BP meds, here\u2019s a reasonable schedule (to discuss with your doctor) based on your background:\n\n- Baseline: Before the next major dose change, get a full renal panel as above (creatinine, eGFR, urea, electrolytes, urine microalbumin/creatinine).  \n- 3 months: Repeat the panel to detect early effects of the medication change.  \n- 6-12 months: If stable, move to every 6-12 months. If any abnormality or further dose changes, consider every 3-4 months.  \n- Also: At any time you experience changes (e.g., worsening BP control, signs of fluid retention, unexpected jump in creatinine, new medication added) \u2014 repeat immediately.  \n\n---\n\n## Additional recommendations  \n- Ensure your food & hydration status is reasonably stable when doing the test (large protein loads, dehydration/excess hydration can skew results). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- Bring a list of all your medications (including over-the-counter or supplements) because many interact with renal function / lab interpretation.  \n- Consider if you want a \u201crenal + cardiovascular\u201d panel (given your hypertension) so you also check lipids, natriuretic peptides, etc for holistic view.  \n- Maintain clear communication with your GP or cardiologist to interpret changes (a rise in creatinine might be expected with some drugs, but needs context).  \n- Ask the lab for standard reference ranges and make sure your doctor has them (lab ranges vary). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can pull together **3-5 other reputable clinics/labs across different parts of Singapore** (e.g., East/West, near where you live) with pricing, location map, so you can pick one convenient for you.

Central area (in addition to ATA)\n\n### (a) River Valley Medical Centre \u2013 Health Screening  \n- **Location:** River Valley area (near Orchard/central).  \n- **What they offer:** Health screening packages that explicitly include:  \n  - *Kidney profile*  \n  - Diabetic profile  \n  - Lipid profile  \n  - Liver profile  \n  - Urine analysis, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- **Why it\u2019s useful for you:** Their kidney profile + diabetic profile (HbA1c, fasting glucose) + lipids gives you both renal and cardiometabolic monitoring while you tweak BP meds.\n\n### (b) Pinnacle Family Clinic (various branches; some central-ish like Novena)  \n- **What they offer:** Health screening packages where even the **Basic** plan includes:  \n  - *Renal panel*  \n  - Diabetic panel  \n  - Liver panel  \n  - Lipid panel  \n  - Urine analysis \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue201  \n- **Why it\u2019s useful:** A simple way to get a bundled renal + metabolic panel at a GP clinic, with a doctor reviewing results.\n\n*(You can use either of these as your \u201croutine\u201d central option, and keep ATA as the more specialised kidney-focused clinic.)*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Ang Mo Kio / Bishan\n\n### (c) Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic (via NHG Diagnostics / NCIS tie-up)  \n- **Lab backbone:** NHG Diagnostics laboratories, which provide a full range of medical tests to polyclinics and are ISO 15189-accredited for medical testing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- **NCIS blood-taking arrangement:** NCIS notes that selected blood tests can be done at **14 polyclinics**, including **Ang Mo Kio**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- **Why it\u2019s useful:**  \n  - Very cost-effective for repeated renal panels and routine bloods.  \n  - Strong quality assurance.  \n  - Easy to coordinate with a polyclinic doctor who\u2019s managing your hypertension, or to share results with your private cardiologist.\n\n*(If you want something more private-clinic-like in Bishan/AMK, most GP chains there\u2014Raffles, OneCare, etc.\u2014will send blood samples to major labs like Parkway, SGH, NUH or Pathlab \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search17\ue201 and can easily order renal profile + HbA1c + lipids.)*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Hougang / Kovan / Punggol belt\n\n### (d) PanHealth Family Clinic \u2013 Hougang & Punggol  \n- **Locations:**  \n  - Hougang: 932B Hougang Ave 9 #01-02  \n  - Punggol: 312B Sumang Link #01-03 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- **What they offer:** Basic health screening package that explicitly lists a **Kidney Profile** (urea, creatinine, sodium, etc.) as part of the tests. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- **Why it\u2019s useful:**  \n  - Very neighbourhood-convenient.  \n  - Package already tuned to include the renal panel you need.\n\n### (e) Parkway Shenton Medical Clinic \u2013 Punggol Oasis Terraces  \n- **Location:** Oasis Terraces, Block 681 Punggol Drive #01-01 (next to Oasis LRT). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- **Services:**  \n  - Chronic disease management (including **high blood pressure** and **high cholesterol**)  \n  - Health screening and blood tests  \n- **Why it\u2019s useful:**  \n  - Good if you want one clinic to both manage your hypertension and run periodic renal + cardiometabolic labs.  \n  - Part of Parkway network; labs go through Parkway Laboratory Services with standard renal panels available. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n\n### (f) OneCare Medical \u2013 Hougang Ave 8 (alternative / backup)  \n- **Location:** Hougang Ave 8.  \n- **Services:** Health screening, vaccinations, and management of chronic conditions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n- **Why it\u2019s useful:** Another GP chain with routine access to full blood panels and renal function tests, convenient if you\u2019re nearer Hougang Ave 8 than Punggol.\n\n---\n\n## What to specifically ask for at any of these\n\nWhen you book, tell them you\u2019re on **Perindopril 5 mg + Amlodipine 2.5 mg** for hypertension and need regular monitoring. Ask for:\n\n1. **Renal function / kidney panel**  \n   - Serum creatinine  \n   - eGFR  \n   - Urea (BUN if they label that way)  \n   - Electrolytes: sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride  \n2. **Urine tests**  \n   - Urine analysis  \n   - Urine albumin/creatinine ratio (or microalbumin) \u2013 especially important for early kidney damage in hypertension. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue201  \n3. **Cardiometabolic add-ons** (sensible given your context):  \n   - Fasting glucose + **HbA1c**  \n   - Lipid panel  \n   - \u00b1 Liver function tests (since multiple drugs/supplements). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Coordination with whoever is managing your BP\n\n- Pick **one main doctor** (GP, cardiologist, or polyclinic doc) to be the \u201ccontrol tower\u201d so dose adjustments and lab trends are reviewed coherently.  \n- Make sure each lab/clinic emails or prints **full reports**, not just \u201cnormal/abnormal\u201d flags, so you or your doctor can track creatinine, eGFR, potassium, etc. over time.  \n\nIf you tell me roughly which of these locations is most convenient to your daily routine (e.g. \u201cPunggol-centric, but work in town\u201d), I can help you design a practical schedule like \u201cbaseline in town, follow-ups in Punggol/Hougang\u201d with suggested test panels at each visit."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200i\ue202turn1image2\ue202turn1image3\ue202turn1image6\ue202turn1image10\ue201","start_idx":0,"end_idx":52,"safe_urls":["https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/55dd/538c/e58e/ce13/bd00/0155/newsletter/Serie_Mply_Punggol_View_03_sm.jpg?1440568192=","https://mustsharenews.com/punggol-oasis-terraces/","https://mustsharenews.com/punggol-oasis-terraces/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/punggol-oasis-terraces-1.jpg","https://punggoltown.com/oasis-terraces/","https://punggoltown.com/oasis-terraces/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://punggoltown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-12.png","https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP._l60ULjcVDr4JFsw_M1q6gHaEv?pid=Api","https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.YZysKqkQlyezRZX76umq3gHaMt?pid=Api","https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.nIdmPIGi1E-qjAKunpTjmQHaEV?pid=Api","https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.8XY465BeNGLVXmkV7bwrswHaFj?pid=Api","https://www.archdaily.com/772537/oasis-terrace-singapores-new-neighborhood-center-and-polyclinic","https://www.archdaily.com/772537/oasis-terrace-singapores-new-neighborhood-center-and-polyclinic?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.m-ply.com.sg/mockup/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12.jpg","https://www.m-ply.com.sg/project/oasis-terraces-punggol-neighbourhood-centre-and-polyclinic/","https://www.m-ply.com.sg/project/oasis-terraces-punggol-neighbourhood-centre-and-polyclinic/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":6},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":10}],"alt":"[![Oasis Terraces -
