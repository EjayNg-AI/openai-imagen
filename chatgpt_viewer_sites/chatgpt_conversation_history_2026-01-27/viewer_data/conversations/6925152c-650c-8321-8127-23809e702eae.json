Drawing comparisons to the Apollo space program, the mission is designed to accelerate scientific breakthroughs by leveraging the Department of Energy's National Laboratories' computing power and data infrastructure. As part of this endeavor, the Energy Secretary is tasked with creating the American Science and Security Platform\u2014a high-performance computing and AI environment for large-scale simulations and model training.\n\nThe initiative will partner with private tech companies, including Nvidia, Dell, AMD, and HPE, to build AI supercomputing facilities, with applications spanning healthcare, energy, and engineering. The program will ensure the protection of intellectual property while sourcing data from federal, academic, and private sectors. Officials believe the mission could reduce scientific discovery timelines from years to mere hours and foresee transformative breakthroughs in health sciences and other fields. Despite political concerns over increased electricity demand from data centers, administration officials emphasize the mission\u2019s potential to reinforce America\u2019s status as a global leader in scientific innovation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":8},"pub_date":1764025437.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bostonglobe.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/04/16/trump/P6jVWXAzaG12Ou5dPXYCDL/story.html","title":"The pageant of Donald Trump\u2019s dreams","snippet":"It began as a planned partnership between Trump and a Florida couple, George Houraney and Jill Harth, who operated American Dream Calendar Girls.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":12},"pub_date":1461551549.67706,"attribution":"www.bostonglobe.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.inquisitr.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-launches-genesis-mission-ai-initiative-to-boost-scientific-discovery","title":"Trump Launches \u201cGenesis Mission\u201d AI Initiative to Boost ...","snippet":"2 hours ago \u2014 President Donald J.

Biden's order mandated that developers of high-risk AI systems conduct safety tests and share the results with the government before public release. It also required agencies to set testing standards and address various security risks associated with AI. The revocation aligns with the 2024 Republican Party platform, which criticized the order for inhibiting AI innovation and advocated for AI development promoting free speech and human flourishing. Despite this revocation, Trump did not overturn another recent order by Biden to support the energy needs of advanced AI data centers. Additionally, the Commerce Department recently imposed restrictions on AI technology exports, eliciting industry pushback.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1737421125.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14110","title":"Executive

Trump's order calls for a review and suspension of all actions taken under Biden's previous directives. It designates a new Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, David Sacks, to lead the development of an AI action plan within 180 days.

Announced by Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on June 3, 2025, the change aligns with the Trump administration\u2019s broader agenda to bolster American AI leadership and reduce regulatory constraints. Originally created in 2023 under President Biden, the AI Safety Institute aimed to develop safety protocols in collaboration with major AI firms and issued guidelines for risks such as biological weapon creation and harmful online content. The new CAISI will now concentrate on tangible threats like cybersecurity, biosecurity, chemical weapons, and foreign influence from AI systems like China's DeepSeek.

Critics argue that defining bias in AI is inherently complex due to the models' reliance on diverse internet data, making neutrality hard to achieve. Experts warn the order may raise First Amendment concerns, as it could suppress certain viewpoints while favoring others. Critics also highlight the inconsistency in AI behavior, where outputs may appear biased depending on the user's perspective and context.

He also moved to lift the Biden administration\u2019s freeze on new natural gas export terminals and to reopen resource extraction in Alaska.\n\nDespite U.S. emissions having fallen in recent years, advances in AI and technology now drive increased energy demand, fueling the need for expanded infrastructure across all energy sources, including nuclear.

What the order actually does (substance, not rhetoric)\n\n**Key institutional moves**\n\n- Establishes the **Genesis Mission** as a whole-of-government effort to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to \u201ctransformative scientific discovery\u201d on nationally defined challenges.\n- Makes the **Secretary of Energy** the operational lead: DOE must stand up and run the **American Science and Security Platform** (the Platform).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- Gives the **Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST)** (who heads the Office of Science and Technology Policy, OSTP) overall strategic coordination authority via the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n**Core technical project**\n\nThe Platform is explicitly described as an integrated stack that must provide:\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\n1. **High-performance computing (HPC)** \u2013 DOE national-lab supercomputers + \u201csecure cloud-based AI computing environments\u201d for training and inference.  \n2. **AI frameworks and agents** \u2013 AI agents to explore design spaces, evaluate experiments, and automate research workflows.  \n3. **Computational tools** \u2013 predictive models, simulations, optimization tools.  \n4. **Domain-specific foundation models** \u2013 large models for particular scientific areas (materials, biotech, energy, etc.).  \n5. **Secure access to datasets** \u2013 proprietary, federally curated, open, and synthetic data, with classification, privacy, and intellectual-property (IP) controls.  \n6. **Autonomous / AI-augmented experimentation and manufacturing** \u2013 robotic labs and production capabilities.\n\nSo it\u2019s not just \u201cmore GPUs\u201d; it is a **closed-loop AI + data + robotics environment for science**.\n\n**Timelines and deliverables**\n\nThe order lays out an aggressive but typical executive-order timetable:\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n- **60 days** \u2013 Secretary of Energy proposes at least **20 national science & tech challenges** across domains: advanced manufacturing, biotech, critical materials, fission/fusion, quantum information, semiconductors and microelectronics.  \n- **90 days** \u2013 Inventory federal computing/network resources and industry partners that can support the Mission.  \n- **120 days** \u2013 Identify initial data/model assets and a plan to ingest more datasets (other agencies, academia, private sector) with risk-based cybersecurity.  \n- **240 days** \u2013 Survey and standardize robotic/automated lab capabilities.  \n- **270 days** \u2013 Demonstrate **initial operating capability** of the Platform on at least one national challenge.  \n- **Annually** \u2013 Report to the President on status, outputs, and partnership/commercialization outcomes.\n\nEvery major step is explicitly \u201csubject to available appropriations\u201d, i.e. it is **implementation-dependent on Congress actually funding it**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What is genuinely new here?\n\n### 2.1 Centralizing science compute and data at DOE\n\nDOE already runs some of the world\u2019s top supercomputers and hosts vast scientific datasets, but they\u2019re fragmented across labs and programs. This order:\n\n- Treats that infrastructure as a **single national AI \u201cscience stack\u201d** to be unified under the Platform.\n- Explicitly pulls in other agencies\u2019 datasets, federally funded research data, and selected private/academic data into that stack.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\nThat\u2019s a **step beyond** existing efforts like the National AI Research Resource (NARR) proposals under the previous administration, which emphasized shared infrastructure but were more distributed and safety-heavy.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \n\n### 2.2 Shift in AI policy framing vs. the Biden era\n\nUnder President Biden, Executive Order 14110 (Oct 2023) framed federal AI policy around **safety, civil rights, and risk mitigation**, including testing obligations for high-risk systems.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n\nTrump has already revoked that EO and replaced it with \u201cRemoving Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence\u201d (Executive Order 14179), which explicitly aims to tear down perceived regulatory obstacles and focus on \u201cglobal AI dominance\u201d.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \n\nThe new Genesis Mission order therefore:\n\n- Sits inside a **deregulatory, dominance-first AI strategy** (the White House fact sheet explicitly says earlier Trump EOs reversed \u201charmful Biden AI policies\u201d, advanced AI education, and targeted \u201cwoke AI\u201d).\ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1news21\ue201  \n- Puts **national security and competitiveness** at the center of scientific compute infrastructure, hence the name \u201cAmerican Science and Security Platform\u201d.\n\nSo compared to the previous cycle, this is a pivot from **\u201csafe and trustworthy AI\u201d** toward **\u201cAI as strategic advantage; safety framed mainly as national security and IP protection\u201d**.\n\n### 2.3 Formalizing AI-native \u201cclosed-loop science\u201d in federal policy\n\nThe order is unusually explicit about:\n\n- **Foundation models** as core scientific infrastructure.  \n- **AI agents** for experiment design and workflow automation.  \n- **Robotic labs and AI-directed manufacturing** as an integral part of the program.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search25\ue201  \n\nThis codifies the \u201cAI scientist + robot lab\u201d vision in U.S. federal science policy, not just in agency roadmaps.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Strategic upside (if implemented competently)\n\n### 3.1 Real acceleration of scientific R&D\n\nIf the Platform actually works as described, the potential upside is non-trivial:\n\n- Central access to **federally funded data + top-tier compute + domain foundation models** allows much more rapid hypothesis generation, simulation, and experiment iteration.  \n- DOE\u2019s labs already drive breakthroughs in materials, climate modeling, particle physics, and nuclear science; adding powerful scientific foundation models and robotic labs could compress discovery timelines in **materials, fusion, catalysts, and biotech** from years to months or weeks.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search26\ue201  \n\nThis moves the government closer to **treating AI as general research infrastructure** analogous to synchrotrons or colliders, but cheaper and more cross-domain.\n\n### 3.2 Coherent industrial and security strategy\n\nThe national challenges list \u2013 manufacturing, biotech, critical materials, semiconductors, fission/fusion, quantum \u2013 aligns with other U.S. strategic priorities (CHIPS, supply-chain resilience, great-power competition).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search26\ue201  \n\nIf the Platform:\n\n- Actually **integrates data and compute from across agencies**,  \n- And coordinates with export controls and industrial policy,  \n\nit could become the **backbone of U.S. tech-industrial strategy** in science-heavy sectors.\n\n### 3.3 Talent and ecosystem effects\n\nThe order calls for competitive **fellowships, internships, and apprenticeships** in AI-enabled science at DOE labs and other facilities.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\nDone well, that can:\n\n- Create an **elite pipeline of AI-native scientists and engineers** who are comfortable with foundation models, agents, and robotic labs.  \n- Strengthen public-sector technical capacity rather than letting everything default to big-tech labs.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Risks, blind spots, and structural concerns\n\n### 4.1 Safety and dual-use risk are under-scoped\n\nThis order is about **capability and integration**, not about controlling downside risk.\n\n- Domains like **biotechnology, nuclear, critical materials, and advanced manufacturing** are explicitly targeted. But there\u2019s no parallel structure for **technical safety governance** comparable to what Biden\u2019s EO attempted (e.g. model evaluation for bio/chem risks, rights-impacting systems, etc.).\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n- The AI Safety Institute has already been re-oriented into a standards and innovation center focused on national security and competition, not broad safety.\ue200cite\ue202turn1news25\ue201  \n\nIn other words, the order **assumes** AI-accelerated science is net-beneficial and controls will be handled by generic classification, cybersecurity, and export-control mechanisms. That is plausibly adequate for some domains (e.g., classified nuclear design), but **thin** for areas like synthetic biology where AI can drastically lower the barrier to dangerous capabilities.\n\n### 4.2 Centralization + secrecy vs. open science\n\nThe Platform is very clearly:\n\n- **Centralized** at DOE.  \n- **Security-oriented** \u2013 heavy emphasis on classification, vetting, export control, trade secrets, and IP rules for public-private work.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\nTensions:\n\n- **Open science vs. strategic secrecy**: many federally funded datasets have historically been open or at least broadly accessible. Integrating them into a security-branded Platform with strict vetting could **re-enclose** parts of the scientific commons.\n- **Who gets access?** The order mentions non-federal collaborators but pairs that with \u201chighest standards of vetting and authorization\u201d and strict data-access processes. In practice, this likely advantages **large, politically plugged-in firms and elite institutions** over smaller players and open-source communities.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0news0\ue201  \n\n### 4.3 Corporate capture and \u201cpicking winners\u201d\n\nPress coverage makes clear that major hardware and cloud vendors (Nvidia, AMD, Dell, HPE, etc.) are already positioning themselves as core partners.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news0\ue202turn0news8\ue202turn0search26\ue201  \n\nThe order:\n\n- Requires standardized partnership and IP frameworks, but leaves huge latitude for **co-development and commercialization** of platform outputs.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- Comes in a political context where the administration has leaned into **public-private mega-deals** (and into AI-stock/crypto narratives).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search26\ue202turn0search27\ue201  \n\nRisk: the Genesis Mission becomes, de facto, a **subsidized national AI lab for a small number of tech and defense contractors**, with limited diffusion of benefits downstream.\n\n### 4.4 \u201cRace\u201d framing and global dynamics\n\nThe text explicitly frames AI as a **race for global technology dominance**, and external commentary compares Genesis to the Manhattan and Apollo projects.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0news21\ue201  \n\nThis has several implications:\n\n- It **reinforces the arms-race dynamic** with China and other powers in advanced AI and compute, reducing political space for serious global safety coordination.  \n- International collaboration is relegated to a single clause about \u201copportunities\u201d, subordinated to a platform whose name literally couples \u201cScience and Security\u201d.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search23\ue201  \n\nFrom a global governance perspective, that\u2019s a bet that **U.S. dominance + export controls + alliances** are preferable to any strongly multilateral AI regime.\n\n### 4.5 Implementation realism\n\nSeveral practical constraints:\n\n- **Appropriations**: every major action is \u201csubject to available appropriations.\u201d Without multi-year, large-scale funding, this can degrade into a branding exercise layered on top of existing DOE programs.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- **Energy and infrastructure**: AI supercomputing is power-hungry. The administration\u2019s broader energy policy prioritizes fossil fuels and rapid expansion of energy supply, but whether grid build-out keeps up in practice is non-trivial.\ue200cite\ue202turn1news30\ue202turn0search25\ue201  \n- **Interagency culture**: DOE is comfortable with HPC, but less so with being a cross-agency AI platform operator for NIH, NSF, DOD, etc. Expect **turf battles** and coordination friction.\n\n---\n\n## 5. How it fits into the broader AI policy trajectory\n\nVery crudely:\n\n- **2023\u20132024 (Biden)** \u2013 \u201cSafe, secure, and trustworthy AI\u201d: emphasis on **risk mitigation, civil rights, international cooperation**, with infrastructure (NARR, AI Safety Institute) to support that.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search13\ue201  \n- **2025 (Trump, early)** \u2013 Revoking that order, rebranding the AI Safety Institute, and issuing \u201cRemoving Barriers\u2026\u201d and \u201canti-woke AI\u201d orders: emphasis on **deregulation and ideological control of government-used models**.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1news29\ue202turn1news25\ue201  \n- **Late 2025 (Genesis)** \u2013 Build a **centralized AI super-infrastructure** for scientific and strategic advantage.\n\nSo Genesis is less about *regulating* AI and more about **weaponizing it for science, industry, and national power**, under a deregulatory supervision regime.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Things to watch over the next 12\u201336 months\n\nIf you want to gauge whether this is transformative or mostly symbolic, key indicators will be:\n\n1. **Appropriations and line items** \u2013 Do budgets for DOE\u2019s labs, AI infrastructure, and Genesis-branded programs actually jump, or is it mostly re-labeling?  \n2. **Platform openness** \u2013 Who gets access to the Platform: only a closed club of defense contractors and elite universities, or a broader research base (including open-source and smaller firms)?  \n3. **Safety architecture** \u2013 Does any serious model evaluation and domain-specific safety work get layered on top of Genesis, especially in biotech and nuclear applications, or is safety reduced to classification and export controls?  \n4. **Concrete outputs** \u2013 Are there visible scientific breakthroughs or prototype technologies credibly tied to Genesis (e.g., new materials, fusion milestones, biologics, chip-design advances)?\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search26\ue201  \n5. **International reactions** \u2013 Does this spur competing \u201cAI for science\u201d national platforms (e.g. EU, China) and further entrench AI as a geopolitical arms-race domain?\n\n---\n\n### Links to coverage and commentary\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent coverage of the Genesis Mission\ue202turn0news1,turn0news0,turn0news5,turn0news8,turn0news18,turn0news21,turn0news23\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":292,"end_idx":324,"safe_urls":["https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-unveils-the-genesis-missionto-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/","https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-unveils-the-genesis-missionto-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/launching-the-genesis-mission/","https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/launching-the-genesis-mission/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/launching-the-genesis-mission/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Launching the Genesis Mission","url":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/launching-the-genesis-mission/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1764021483.0,"snippet":"5 hours ago \u2014 Operation of the American Science and Security Platform.

President Donald Trump has revoked a 2023 executive order signed by Joe Biden aimed at mitigating risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). Biden's order mandated that developers of high-risk AI systems conduct safety tests and share the results with the government before public release. It also required agencies to set testing standards and address various security risks associated with AI. The revocation aligns with the 2024 Republican Party platform, which criticized the order for inhibiting AI innovation and advocated for AI development promoting free speech and human flourishing. Despite this revocation, Trump did not overturn another recent order by Biden to support the energy needs of advanced AI data centers. Additionally, the Commerce Department recently imposed restrictions on AI technology exports, eliciting industry pushback.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Executive Order 14179","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14179?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution":"Wikipedia"},{"title":"Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial ...","url":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"23 Jan 2025 \u2014 This order revokes certain existing AI policies and directives that act as barriers to American AI innovation, clearing a path for the United States to act ...","attribution":"The White House"},{"title":"AI: Broad Biden Order Is Withdrawn, but Replacement ...","url":"https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/executive-briefing/ai-broad-biden-order-is-withdrawn?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"30 Jan 2025 \u2014 On January 23, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled \u201cRemoving Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial ...","attribution":"Skadden"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1news21\ue201","start_idx":4863,"end_idx":4895,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/eef1e5b9bec861eaf9b36217d547929c","https://apnews.com/article/eef1e5b9bec861eaf9b36217d547929c?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-unveils-the-genesis-missionto-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/","https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-unveils-the-genesis-missionto-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-unveils-the-genesis-missionto-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Fact Sheet: President Donald J.

The order seeks to revoke existing policies from the Biden era, including a 2023 executive order that mandated federal agencies to halt the use of AI tools if they were found to harm the public. Trump's order calls for a review and suspension of all actions taken under Biden's previous directives. It designates a new Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, David Sacks, to lead the development of an AI action plan within 180 days. Trump's administration asserts that Biden's policies hindered innovation and threatened U.S. technological leadership, while Biden's initiatives were designed to ensure AI systems didn't discriminate or harm the public.

Originally created in 2023 under President Biden, the AI Safety Institute aimed to develop safety protocols in collaboration with major AI firms and issued guidelines for risks such as biological weapon creation and harmful online content. The new CAISI will now concentrate on tangible threats like cybersecurity, biosecurity, chemical weapons, and foreign influence from AI systems like China's DeepSeek.

That evening, Trump signed executive orders withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement again and formally ending U.S. support for it, along with rolling back Biden-era restrictions on oil and gas exports, particularly liquefied natural gas.\n\nTrump pledged to revive fossil fuel production, fill strategic reserves, and boost energy exports to stimulate U.S. manufacturing and economic prosperity. He also moved to lift the Biden administration\u2019s freeze on new natural gas export terminals and to reopen resource extraction in Alaska.\n\nDespite U.S. emissions having fallen in recent years, advances in AI and technology now drive increased energy demand, fueling the need for expanded infrastructure across all energy sources, including nuclear. Trump also rescinded requirements for electric vehicle production and halted funding for green projects under the Inflation Reduction Act. Auto jobs and domestic production, particularly in the Midwest, took center stage in his energy revival plan.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Trump signs executive order creating 'Genesis Mission' AI ...","url":"https://www.trtworld.com/article/5007734d73f5?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"1 hour ago \u2014 ...

Biden's order mandated that developers of high-risk AI systems conduct safety tests and share the results with the government before public release. It also required agencies to set testing standards and address various security risks associated with AI. The revocation aligns with the 2024 Republican Party platform, which criticized the order for inhibiting AI innovation and advocated for AI development promoting free speech and human flourishing. Despite this revocation, Trump did not overturn another recent order by Biden to support the energy needs of advanced AI data centers. Additionally, the Commerce Department recently imposed restrictions on AI technology exports, eliciting industry pushback.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Executive Order 14179","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14179?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution":"Wikipedia"},{"title":"Trump is targeting 'woke AI.'

Critics argue that defining bias in AI is inherently complex due to the models' reliance on diverse internet data, making neutrality hard to achieve. Experts warn the order may raise First Amendment concerns, as it could suppress certain viewpoints while favoring others. Critics also highlight the inconsistency in AI behavior, where outputs may appear biased depending on the user's perspective and context. While some policy analysts find the executive order more moderate than expected, concerns remain over potential ideological enforcement and its impact on free expression in AI development.","attribution":"The Washington Post"},{"title":"US removes 'safety' from AI Safety Institute","url":"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/679852/trump-ai-safety-institute-name-mission-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The U.S. Department of Commerce has renamed the AI Safety Institute to the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI), signaling a shift in focus from general AI safety to addressing national security risks and preventing excessive international regulation. Announced by Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on June 3, 2025, the change aligns with the Trump administration\u2019s broader agenda to bolster American AI leadership and reduce regulatory constraints. Originally created in 2023 under President Biden, the AI Safety Institute aimed to develop safety protocols in collaboration with major AI firms and issued guidelines for risks such as biological weapon creation and harmful online content. The new CAISI will now concentrate on tangible threats like cybersecurity, biosecurity, chemical weapons, and foreign influence from AI systems like China's DeepSeek. This policy shift follows Trump\u2019s revocation of a Biden-era executive order on AI safety and a push for increased AI adoption and less regulation, including a proposed 10-year halt on state-level AI rules.","attribution":"The Verge"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search26\ue201","start_idx":13822,"end_idx":13855,"safe_urls":["https://www.ainvest.com/news/trump-ai-ambition-meets-market-doubt-private-sector-ties-drive-national-tech-push-2511/","https://www.ainvest.com/news/trump-ai-ambition-meets-market-doubt-private-sector-ties-drive-national-tech-push-2511/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/11/president-trump-launches-the-genesis-mission-to-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/","https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/11/president-trump-launches-the-genesis-mission-to-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/11/president-trump-launches-the-genesis-mission-to-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"President Trump Launches the Genesis Mission to ...","url":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/11/president-trump-launches-the-genesis-mission-to-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1764024583.0,"snippet":"4 hours ago \u2014 The Genesis Mission connects world-class scientific data with the most advanced American AI to unlock breakthroughs in medicine, energy, ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Trump's AI Ambition Meets Market Doubt as Private Sector ...","url":"https://www.ainvest.com/news/trump-ai-ambition-meets-market-doubt-private-sector-ties-drive-national-tech-push-2511/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"4 hours ago \u2014 President Donald J.

Transparent, holographic interfaces curve around the scene: glowing neural networks, lattice-like knowledge graphs, and swirling streams of data linking laboratories, satellites, and quantum computers.\n\nAt the center, a large semi-transparent globe of the Earth slowly rotates, overlaid with a luminous network of AI nodes and fiber-optic lines converging on the United States. Over North America, a brilliant hub labeled **\u201cGenesis Platform\u201d** radiates beams of light toward icons for **biotech**, **fusion energy**, **semiconductors**, **advanced manufacturing**, and **quantum information**. Each domain is represented by detailed 3D holograms: a self-assembling chip at nanoscale, a compact fusion reactor, programmable cells, and arrays of robotic arms in autonomous labs.\n\nIn the midground, towering vertical displays show American scientists, engineers, and AI agents collaborating: robotic manipulators running experiments, autonomous drones scanning materials, and digital assistants projecting formulas, molecular models, and circuit diagrams. The design language is minimalist and sleek: clean lines, cold metal, deep blues, and sharp white accents, with subtle red hints echoing the American flag.\n\nIn the background, the dark expanse of space transitions into a glowing, data-rich nebula shaped like a stylized eagle in flight, symbolizing the United States ascending as the global AI leader.
