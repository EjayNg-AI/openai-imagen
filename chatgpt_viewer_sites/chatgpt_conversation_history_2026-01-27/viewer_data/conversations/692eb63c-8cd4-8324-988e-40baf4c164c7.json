What *is* the correct minimal condition?\n\nThe correct necessary-and-sufficient statement is:\n\n> **The range of a continuous function \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) is closed  \n> iff  \n> for every sequence \\((x_n)\\) with \\(|x_n|\\to\\infty\\), the sequence \\((f(x_n))\\) has no finite limit.**\n\nThis is the genuine obstruction: an *escaping* sequence approaching a finite value the function never attains.\n\nEquivalently:\n\n> \\(f\\) is **proper** as a map from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nThat is:\n\n\\[\n|x_n|\\to\\infty \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad |f(x_n)|\\to\\infty.\n\\]\n\nThis condition **does** guarantee closedness of the range, and it is also **minimal**: weaken it in any way and counterexamples appear.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why unboundedness alone cannot work\n\nUnbounded range does *not* constrain the local behaviour of \\(f\\).  \nA continuous function can be wildly oscillatory on a bounded set and create \u201choles\u201d in its image, even though its image grows without bound at infinity.\n\nThe missing values are always caused by either:\n\n- oscillation on a compact region, or  \n- approach to a nonattained limit at infinity.\n\nUnboundedness eliminates neither.\n\n---\n\n## 4.
