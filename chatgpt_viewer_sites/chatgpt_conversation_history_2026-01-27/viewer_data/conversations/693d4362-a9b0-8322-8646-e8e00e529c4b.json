This marks the first time artificial intelligence systems have surpassed the gold-medal threshold at the prestigious math competition for high school students. The models each solved five out of six problems within the official 4.5-hour time limit using general-purpose reasoning models operating in natural language, rather than traditional formal computation-based methods.\n\nGoogle\u2019s entry, Gemini Deep Think, and an experimental OpenAI model demonstrated advanced mathematical reasoning, showcasing significant progress in AI capabilities. Experts, including Brown University professor Junehyuk Jung, believe this development could soon enable AI to assist in solving complex unsolved research problems in mathematics and potentially other scientific domains like physics.\n\nAlthough OpenAI published its results first, it did so independently without official IMO collaboration, while Google coordinated research with IMO and published results after judges verified them.

avoid the \u201cclassic\u201d ones that later get re-posted widely.\n\n### Print-first / publisher-hosted \u201cProblem Book\u201d style collections\nCambridge\u2019s *Hungarian Problem Book* series is a canonical example of very hard problems curated in a book format (not a giant free solution index page). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n**Caveat:** solutions exist (in the book), but they\u2019re not \u201cone Google query away\u201d the way AoPS/IMO-shortlist solutions are.\n\n## 2) Competitions/exams that are comparable in *taste* (and sometimes difficulty), but where **official solutions are not trivially findable**\n\n### University \u201cTripos-style\u201d exam papers (hard, technical, proofy)\nCambridge Tripos papers are widely available as papers, but \u201cofficial model solutions\u201d are not generally published as a complete set; you mostly find partial/educational solution sets (e.g., examples for specific years). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n**Why it helps:** you can source many tough questions while keeping solution leakage lower than standard contest ecosystems.\n\n### University prize/departmental exams (often PDFs with limited circulation)\nSome departments publicly post problem PDFs (sometimes bundled with source notes), but solutions are inconsistent or absent, and web indexing is spotty (example: compiled \u201cPrize Exam\u201d problem PDFs). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \n**Why it helps:** these can be very \u201cSchweitzer-adjacent\u201d in style\u2014longer arguments, more syllabus depth.\n\n## 3) Competitions that are strong but *more likely* to have solutions online (use selectively)\nThese are good for difficulty, but you\u2019ll need to be choosy because many solutions exist.\n\n### IMC (International Mathematics Competition for University Students)\nProblems are published yearly, and solutions exist, but the completeness/quality varies and isn\u2019t always \u201cinstant canonical solutions everywhere.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201  \n**Practical trick:** take the **most recent year(s)** and prefer problems that are *not* already on big-solution hubs.\n\n## 4) How to reliably get \u201cnot in training data\u201d (or at least \u201cnot easily web-solvable\u201d)\nThis is the part that matters most in practice:\n\n1. **Prioritize recency**: use problems from the last ~12\u201324 months (far fewer polished writeups floating around yet).\n2. **Prefer sources that are paywalled / print / departmental** (Crux recent issues; books; internal exams). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n3. **Exploit language barriers**: pull from national selections or university contests in Hungarian/Russian/Chinese/Vietnamese, then translate yourself. Even when problems are online, *solutions* often aren\u2019t in English (or aren\u2019t indexed well).\n4. **Avoid the \u201cAoPS/IMO Shortlist gravity well\u201d**: if a problem is on AoPS or Evan Chen\u2019s indexes, assume it\u2019s widely learned. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n5. **Build your own \u201cclean-room\u201d set**: collect PDFs/booklets, store locally, and *don\u2019t* rely on web links when testing your solver loop.\n\n## A blunt reality check\nEven Schweitzer problems themselves are quite findable online (problem statements, and sometimes solutions/blog writeups). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \nSo for your \u201cLLM-resistance\u201d objective, **the source matters less than the distribution channel** (recent + not indexed + not reposted).\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me what areas you want to emphasize (e.g., combinatorics vs functional equations vs algebra/number theory), I can propose a concrete harvesting plan: \u201cX sources + Y-year window + filtering rules\u201d to assemble, say, a 100-problem bank with minimal web-solution contamination."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":693,"end_idx":712,"safe_urls":["https://cms.math.ca/competitions/problem-solving-resources/","https://cms.math.ca/competitions/problem-solving-resources/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([cms.math.ca](https://cms.math.ca/competitions/problem-solving-resources/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Problem solving resources","url":"https://cms.math.ca/competitions/problem-solving-resources/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Periodical available in print and online.

Problems section (every issue)\nEach issue contains a curated set of **original problems**, typically spanning:\n- Algebra\n- Number theory\n- Geometry\n- Combinatorics\n- Analysis (often subtle, not routine calculus)\n\nThe difficulty is **high undergraduate \u2192 early graduate**, which puts many of the better problems **squarely in Schweitzer / IMC territory**, especially the harder ones.\n\nThese are not olympiad-style puzzles; they usually require:\n- Structural insight\n- Clean, well-motivated arguments\n- Occasionally a clever lemma rather than brute force\n\n### 2. Solutions appear later (with delay)\n- Solutions are published **months later**, often **6\u201312 months after** the problem first appears.\n- Until that happens, there is *no official solution* available.\n- Even after publication, solutions are:\n  - Behind an **MAA / publisher paywall**\n  - Not systematically reposted on AoPS or blogs (unlike IMO/Putnam problems)\n\nThis makes recent Monthly problems **excellent candidates** for \u201clow web contamination\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## Why this matters for your stated goal (LLM-resistant problems)\n\nFrom your earlier question, you care about:\n- Schweitzer-level depth\n- Minimal prior exposure in training data\n- Problems that reward real mathematical reasoning, not pattern recall\n\nThe **American Mathematical Monthly is one of the best sources** still operating that meets all three:\n\n### Advantages\n- Continuous stream of new problems (monthly)\n- Editorially filtered for elegance and depth\n- No central free solution archive\n- Many problems never become \u201cfamous\u201d or widely discussed online\n\n### Caveat (important)\nSome Monthly problems **do eventually leak** into:\n- Lecture notes\n- Personal blogs\n- AoPS threads (rare, but it happens)\n\nHowever:\n- This usually takes **years**\n- The harder problems often *never* gain traction outside the journal\n\n---\n\n## Practical advice if you want to use Monthly problems seriously\n\nIf you want to treat them as a **clean testbed**:\n\n1. **Use problems from the last 1\u20133 years**\n   - Ideally newer than any public solution publication\n2. **Avoid Putnam-adjacent ones**\n   - Some Monthly problems are inspired by Putnam-style ideas and may overlap conceptually\n3. **Download PDFs locally**\n   - Don\u2019t rely on scraped webpages or secondary reposts\n4. **Prefer problems with vague or open-ended statements**\n   - These tend to be harder for LLMs and less likely to be memorized\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- **Yes**, the American Mathematical Monthly still publishes problems in every issue.\n- **Yes**, many of them are comparable in *depth and taste* to Schweitzer problems.\n- **Yes**, recent ones are among the **best readily available sources** of genuinely challenging problems with **low solution visibility** on the open web.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Recommend **which Monthly sections/problems historically trend hardest**\n- Help you design a **\u201cclean Monthly-only benchmark\u201d** for your solver\u2013evaluator loop\n- Compare Monthly problems vs **IMC / Schweitzer / Tripos** in a more technical way\n\nJust say which direction you want to go."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"sonic_classification_result":{"latency_ms":65.18331400002353,"simple_search_prob":0.24528785010198628,"complex_search_prob":0.30831958904541906,"no_search_prob":0.44639256085259466,"search_complexity_decision":"no_search","search_decision":false,"simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","classifier_config":{"model_name":"snc-pg-sw-3cls-ev3","renderer_name":"harmony_v4.0.15_16k_orion_text_only_no_asr_2k_action","classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","model_config_name":"chatgpt_sonic_classifier_model_config","disable_sonic_prefetch_classifier":false,"force_disabled_rate":0.0,"force_enabled_rate":0.0,"num_messages":20,"only_user_messages":false,"remove_memory":true,"support_mm":true,"n_ctx":2048,"max_action_length":4,"dynamic_set_max_message_size":false,"max_message_tokens":2000,"append_base_config":false,"no_search_token":"1","simple_search_token":"7","complex_search_token":"5","simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"prefetch_threshold":0.55,"first_turn_prefetch_threshold":null,"force_search_first_turn_threshold":1e-05,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"passthrough_tool_calls":true,"passthrough_tool_name_exclusions":["genui"],"timeout":1.0},"classifier_snapshot_id":null,"decision_source":"classifier","passthrough_tool_names":["api_tool","automations","bio","canmore","container","file_search","gcal","gcontacts","gmail","image_gen","python","python_user_visible"]},"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"a5e1d532-cf38-4bbd-9b81-0b6130188c48","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"a198f0ec-5f4c-44bd-8c18-bba327c9635b","turn_exchange_id":"5c4f8e19-0439-45f0-b614-905f77a5b415"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"a198f0ec-5f4c-44bd-8c18-bba327c9635b","children":[]}}}
