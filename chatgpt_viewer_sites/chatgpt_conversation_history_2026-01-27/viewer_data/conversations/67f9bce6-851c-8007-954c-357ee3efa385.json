This mission is explicitly stated in the OpenAI \r\nNonprofit incorporation documents. OpenAI committed to several key principles for \r\nexecuting on that mission in their Charter document. These commitments were taken \r\nextremely seriously within the company and were repeatedly communicated and \r\ntreated internally as being binding.\r\n\u2022 OpenAI\u2019s unique corporate structure\u2014a nonprofit controlling a group of other \r\nsubsidiaries\u2014was a crucial part of its overall strategy. The Nonprofit having ultimate \r\ncontrol was considered highly important by leadership and staff for OpenAI\u2019s ability to \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 6 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n2\r\nsuccessfully execute on its mission.\r\n\u2022 OpenAI\u2019s mission, the OpenAI Charter, and the central controlling role of the \r\nNonprofit were critical to OpenAI\u2019s ability to attract and retain talent. They were \r\nroutinely used to persuade candidates to join the company and to convince employees \r\nwho were considering leaving to stay.\r\n\u2022 If the OpenAI Nonprofit agreed to a change in the OpenAI corporate structure which \r\ntook away its controlling role, that would fundamentally violate its mission.\r\nAny fundamental restructuring that removes the Nonprofit\u2019s controlling role would not \r\nonly contradict OpenAI\u2019s founding mission and Charter commitments, but would also breach the \r\ntrust of employees, donors, and other stakeholders who joined and supported the organization \r\nbased on these commitments. The Court should recognize that maintaining the Nonprofit\u2019s \r\ngovernance is essential to preserving OpenAI\u2019s unique structure, which was designed to ensure \r\nthat artificial general intelligence benefits humanity rather than serving narrow financial interests.\r\nARGUMENT\r\nI. OpenAI Committed to Core Principles for Pursuing Its Mission in its Charter\r\nOpenAI, Inc. (the \u201cNonprofit\u201d)\u2019s Mission as set forth in Article Third of its Certificate of \r\nIncorporation is \u201cto ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.\u201d That article \r\nfurther states that \u201c[t]he resulting technology will benefit the public and the corporation will seek \r\nto distribute it for the public benefit when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the \r\nprivate gain of any person.\u201d\r\nIn its Charter, first published in April 2018, OpenAI re-states its Mission and affirms its \r\ncommitment to four core principles for executing the Mission:\r\nOpenAI\u2019s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence \r\n(AGI)\u2014by which we mean highly autonomous systems that \r\noutperform humans at most economically valuable work\u2014benefits \r\nall of humanity. We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial \r\nAGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 7 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n3\r\nothers to achieve this outcome. To that end, we commit to the \r\nfollowing principles:\r\nBroadly distributed benefits\r\nWe commit to use any influence we obtain over AGI\u2019s \r\ndeployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all, and to avoid \r\nenabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly \r\nconcentrate power.\r\nOur primary fiduciary duty is to humanity. We anticipate \r\nneeding to marshal substantial resources to fulfill our mission, but \r\nwill always diligently act to minimize conflicts of interest among \r\nour employees and stakeholders that could compromise broad \r\nbenefit.\r\nLong-term safety\r\nWe are committed to doing the research required to make \r\nAGI safe, and to driving the broad adoption of such research across \r\nthe AI community.\r\nWe are concerned about late-stage AGI development \r\nbecoming a competitive race without time for adequate safety \r\nprecautions. Therefore, if a value-aligned, safety-conscious project \r\ncomes close to building AGI before we do, we commit to stop \r\ncompeting with and start assisting this project. We will work out \r\nspecifics in case-by-case agreements, but a typical triggering \r\ncondition might be \u201ca better-than-even chance of success in the next \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 8 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n4\r\ntwo years.\u201d\r\nTechnical leadership\r\nTo be effective at addressing AGI\u2019s impact on society, \r\nOpenAI must be on the cutting edge of AI capabilities\u2014policy and \r\nsafety advocacy alone would be insufficient.\r\nWe believe that AI will have broad societal impact before \r\nAGI, and we\u2019ll strive to lead in those areas that are directly aligned \r\nwith our mission and expertise.\r\nCooperative orientation\r\nWe will actively cooperate with other research and policy \r\ninstitutions; we seek to create a global community working together \r\nto address AGI\u2019s global challenges.\r\nWe are committed to providing public goods that help \r\nsociety navigate the path to AGI. Today this includes publishing \r\nmost of our AI research, but we expect that safety and security \r\nconcerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future, while \r\nincreasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards \r\nresearch.\r\nInternally, these commitments were considered to be binding and were taken extremely \r\nseriously. The primacy of the Charter is directly referenced in official company documents, as \r\nshown in section II, and it was consistently emphasized by senior leadership at company meetings \r\nand in informal conversations.\r\nThe Charter was positioned as the foundational document guiding all of OpenAI\u2019s strategic \r\ndecisions. Senior leaders such as Sam Altman and Greg Brockman would regularly reference the \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 9 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 10 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n5\r\nCharter when explaining the rationale behind organizational decisions or addressing questions \r\nabout OpenAI\u2019s approach to AGI development. The Charter provided guidance on how the \r\norganization would address complex questions about ensuring human flourishing, distributing the \r\nbenefits of AGI equitably, and balancing competitive advancement with safety considerations.\r\nWithin OpenAI, there was a dedicated internal working group established with the specific \r\naim of translating the abstract principles of the Charter into concrete, actionable policies and \r\nprocedures. That group did deep dives into the language and intent of the Charter, trying to answer \r\ncomplex questions about how to apply its commitments in day-to-day operations and strategic \r\ndecisions. Their work aimed to more concretely align the company\u2019s actions and priorities with \r\nthe Charter commitments.\r\nThe Charter\u2019s significance was further institutionalized within OpenAI\u2019s formal employee \r\nevaluation systems. Following the transition to the capped-profit structure, OpenAI leadership \r\nimplemented performance review processes that explicitly incorporated employees\u2019 understanding \r\nof and commitment to the mission as defined in the Charter. Understanding, internalizing, and \r\nactively upholding the Charter became formal requirements for career advancement within the \r\norganization. Employees at all levels were evaluated not just on their technical contributions but \r\nalso on how well they aligned their work with the Charter\u2019s principles and ensured their \r\ncolleagues did the same.\r\nII. Nonprofit Control Over the OpenAI Corporate Structure Was Considered Critical \r\nfor Upholding the Charter Commitments and Successfully Executing the Mission\r\nOpenAI has a unique corporate structure \u2014 a 501(c)(3) public charity that fully controls \r\nseveral for-profit subsidiaries. This structure \u2014 and in particular, the Nonprofit\u2019s full control over \r\nit \u2014 was considered critically important for the Nonprofit\u2019s ability to uphold the Charter \r\ncommitments and successfully execute on the mission. This was consistently repeated by OpenAI \r\nexecutives both internally and externally from 2019 until 2024.\r\nWhen the initial transition to a \u201ccapped-profit\u201d structure happened in 2019, the Limited \r\nPartnership Agreement clearly stated that the Partnership exists to advance the mission of the \r\nNonprofit, the Nonprofit retains full control, and the General Partner\u2019s duty to the mission and the \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 10 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n6\r\nprinciples advanced in the Charter take precedence over any obligation to generate a profit:\r\n\u2022 \u201cOpenAI, L.P. will be a for-profit Delaware Limited Partnership managed by its \r\nGeneral Partner, a single-member Delaware LLC controlled by OpenAI, Inc.

Nonprofit Control and Charter Commitments Were Central to Talent Retention and \r\nAcquisition\r\nThe OpenAI Charter played an important role in enhancing the organization\u2019s brand \r\nidentity, serving as a tangible representation of its core values and mission. Physical copies of the \r\nCharter were prominently displayed and readily available, acting as a testament to OpenAI\u2019s \r\ncommitment to its stated principles. This consistent visibility, through brochures, guest offerings, \r\nand new-hire packets, reinforced the Charter\u2019s importance and its role in shaping the company\u2019s \r\npublic image.\r\nWhen OpenAI was transitioning from a pure nonprofit to the \u201ccapped-profit\u201d limited \r\npartnership structure in 2019, many employees expressed significant concerns about whether \r\ncommercial pressures would lead to the elimination or marginalization of the nonprofit\u2019s original \r\nmission and the Charter commitments. OpenAI took these concerns seriously enough to \r\ncommission an internal team to do an analysis on how the transition would affect the Nonprofit\u2019s \r\nmission. During the transition, Sam Altman and other company executives addressed the concerns \r\ndirectly and tried to allay fears across multiple all-hands meetings.\r\nLeadership repeatedly emphasized that the Nonprofit entity maintained full legal control \r\nover the capped-profit LP, and that the LP documents explicitly stated that the organization\u2019s \r\nprimary fiduciary obligation was to humanity, not to investors. As the OpenAI LP announcement \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 13 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 14 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n9\r\nstated: \u201cOpenAI LP\u2019s primary fiduciary obligation is to advance the aims of the OpenAI Charter... \r\nAll investors and employees sign agreements that OpenAI LP\u2019s obligation to the Charter always \r\ncomes first, even at the expense of some or all of their financial stake.\u201d\r\nThese assurances about the nonprofit\u2019s continued control and the legally binding \r\nsubordination of profit to mission were not treated as mere rhetoric\u2014they were critical to the \r\ncompany\u2019s ability to retain talent throughout the transition. Many employees who had joined \r\nspecifically because of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit mission would have departed without these formal \r\nreassurances that the organization would legally prioritize the Charter commitments over financial \r\nreturns.\r\nAt the end of 2020, multiple key employees left OpenAI and many others were considering \r\ndoing the same. To address employee concerns, the company held a virtual summit, including \r\nQ&A sessions with leadership. At those sessions CEO Sam Altman emphasized the critical role of \r\nnonprofit control in successfully executing OpenAI\u2019s mission. He articulated that this unique \r\nstructure ensured the organization remained focused on its long-term goals of safe and beneficial \r\nAGI development. Altman stressed that the nonprofit\u2019s governance and oversight were paramount \r\nin upholding the commitments outlined in the OpenAI Charter, guaranteeing that safety and broad \r\nsocietal benefits were prioritized over short-term financial gains.\r\nAfter the capped-profit transition, nonprofit control over OpenAI\u2019s corporate structure \r\ncontinued being a material condition for attracting talent \u2014 particularly those concerned with AI \r\nsafety and the societal impacts of AI. In recruiting conversations with candidates, it was common \r\nto cite OpenAI\u2019s unique governance structure as a critical differentiating factor between OpenAI \r\nand competitors such as Google or Anthropic and an important reason they should consider \r\njoining the company. This same reason was also often used to persuade employees who were \r\nconsidering leaving for competitors to stay at OpenAI \u2014 including some of us.\r\nThe \u201cmerge and assist clause\u201d in the OpenAI Charter \u2014\u201cIf a value-aligned, safety\u0002conscious project comes close to building AGI before we do, we commit to stop competing with \r\nand start assisting this project\u201d\u2014was often cited during these discussions as a structural safeguard \r\nthat would prevent the company triggering a dynamic in which competitors would race to AGI as \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 14 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 15 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n10\r\nanyone got close. This commitment was presented in staff meetings as something only possible \r\nunder OpenAI\u2019s structure, as traditional for-profit companies would be unlikely to subordinate \r\nshareholder interests in such a manner.\r\nOverall, OpenAI\u2019s status as a nonprofit before 2019, and as a capped-profit under the full \r\ncontrol of the nonprofit since then, substantially helped OpenAI\u2019s recruiting and retention efforts. \r\nMany employees were inspired by the nonprofit mission and the Charter commitments and chose \r\nto work at OpenAI in large part because of them.\r\nIV. Loss of Nonprofit Control Over OpenAI Would Violate The Nonprofit\u2019s Mission\r\nToday, OpenAI is attempting to transition to a corporate structure in which the Nonprofit \r\nmight lose its control over the for-profit subsidiaries. Such a loss of control would violate the \r\nNonprofit\u2019s mission. The Nonprofit can not \u201censure that artificial general intelligence benefits all \r\nof humanity\u201d without having effective control over the corporate entity that is actually building \r\nartificial general intelligence.\r\nThis violation becomes especially clear when we look at the specific Charter \r\ncommitments. Loss of nonprofit control is fundamentally incompatible with the commitment to \r\nbroadly distribute benefits and with the commitment to long-term safety. It is important to note \r\nthat in a recent blog post describing the planned evolution of their corporate structure, OpenAI \r\ndoes not mention the Charter a single time. Given how heavily the Charter and the commitments \r\nmade in it featured in official documents and communication from 2019 to 2024, this is quite \r\nsurprising \u2014 and could potentially indicate that OpenAI themselves are aware that should their \r\nproposed restructuring result in a loss of nonprofit control, that would violate commitments made \r\nin the Charter.\r\nLoss of nonprofit control violates the Charter commitment to broadly distribute benefits \r\nbecause it prevents the nonprofit from \u201censuring AGI\u2019s deployment is used for the benefit of all\u201d\r\nor \u201cavoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power,\u201d as the \r\nnonprofit would no longer have any control over how AGI\u2019s deployment is used. Instead, if \r\nOpenAI develops AGI, power over it would be concentrated among its shareholders.\r\nLoss of nonprofit control also violates the Charter commitment to long-term safety by \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 15 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 16 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n11\r\nessentially removing the \u201cmerge-and-assist clause.\u201d The Nonprofit can no longer credibly commit \r\nto \u201cstop competing with and start assisting\u201d any \u201cvalue-aligned, safety-conscious project [that] \r\ncomes close to building AGI before we do\u201d if it does not control the for-profit subsidiary that is \r\nbuilding AGI. Instead, for-profit shareholders who would control the subsidiary would be \r\nincentivized to do exactly the opposite in such a competitive scenario \u2014 race ahead to catch up, \r\npotentially cutting corners on safety to do so.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nOpenAI, Inc. was established with an explicit and unambiguous mission: to ensure \r\nartificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. This mission was not merely aspirational\u2014\r\nit was codified in multiple legal documents, reinforced through the OpenAI Charter, and \r\nconsistently communicated both internally and externally as the organization\u2019s North Star. The \r\nunique corporate structure placing the Nonprofit in control was intentionally designed as the \r\nfundamental safeguard ensuring OpenAI would never stray from this mission.\r\nThe evidence presented\u2014from Senate testimony and public statements to communications \r\nwith employees\u2014demonstrates that OpenAI\u2019s leadership, including CEO Sam Altman, \r\nconsistently emphasized the Nonprofit\u2019s controlling role to various stakeholders as essential to \r\n\u201cprioritize safe and beneficial AI development.\u201d This control mechanism wasn\u2019t incidental to \r\nOpenAI\u2019s mission\u2014it was the central structural feature enabling the organization to uphold its \r\nCharter commitments to broadly distribute benefits, ensure long-term safety, maintain technical \r\nleadership, and foster cooperative orientation.\r\nFurthermore, the Nonprofit\u2019s governance control served as a critical recruiting and \r\nretention tool, allowing OpenAI to attract top talent who wanted to work at an organization \r\nstructurally committed to developing AGI for humanity\u2019s benefit. These employees relied on the \r\ncontinued governance role of the Nonprofit as a guarantee that their work would serve \r\nhumanitarian rather than purely commercial ends.\r\nAny restructuring that removes the Nonprofit\u2019s controlling role would therefore constitute \r\na profound breach of trust with employees, donors, policymakers, and the public. More \r\nfundamentally, it would render the Nonprofit incapable of fulfilling its mission to ensure AGI \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 16 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n12\r\nbenefits humanity, as it would surrender its ability to direct how AGI is developed, deployed, and \r\ngoverned.

Allowing a restructuring that eliminates this control would effectively permit the \r\ndiversion of nonprofit assets and contributions toward purposes fundamentally at odds with the \r\nNonprofit\u2019s charitable obligations. Such an outcome would not only contravene OpenAI\u2019s explicit \r\ncommitments but would undermine public trust in nonprofit governance structures more broadly.\r\nDATED: April 11, 2025 Respectfully submitted,\r\n/s/ Lester Lessig\r\nAttorney for Proposed Amici Curiae\r\n(Pro Hac Pending)\r\nOn behalf of: \r\nSteven Adler \r\nRosemary Campbell, \r\nNeil Chowdhury, \r\nJacob H.

Markov, declare as follows:\r\n1. Beginning in 2018, I worked as a researcher at OpenAI on a variety of teams, \r\nculminating in my assignment to the Preparedness team, where I worked on evaluating the \r\npersuasion abilities of frontier systems. \r\n2. I am presently a researcher at Anthropic, where I work on the Knowledge team. \r\n3. I have helped organize this amicus brief without any encouragement or input from \r\nmy current employer. \r\n4. I left OpenAI in 2024 because I lost trust in its leadership team. \r\n5. I lost trust because in May 2024, I learned that OpenAI was routinely requiring \r\ndeparting employees to sign a general release including a broad lifetime non-disparagement \r\nagreement as a precondition for keeping their vested equity. For many employees \u2014 myself included \r\n\u2014 this equity represented a very large fraction of our overall life savings. This condition was \r\nintentionally hidden from employees by being phrased in a highly obfuscated manner and by being \r\nput in legal documents that we only saw and were asked to sign a few months after our initial joining \r\ndates. At an all-hands meeting, CEO Sam Altman was asked directly whether he had known that \r\nthis was a standard practice for all departing employees. At that meeting, he disclaimed knowledge. \r\nImmediately after that meeting, a media article was published showing official company documents \r\nwith Sam Altman\u2019s signature on them which explicitly described the requirement to sign a general \r\nrelease in order to retain one\u2019s vested equity in great detail. This course of events led me to believe \r\nthat CEO Sam Altman was a person of low integrity who had directly lied to employees about the \r\nextent of his knowledge and involvement in OpenAI\u2019s practices of forcing departing employees to \r\nsign lifetime non-disparagement agreements; and that he was very likely lying to employees about \r\na number of other important topics, including but not limited to the sincerity of OpenAI\u2019s \r\ncommitment to the Charter \u2014 which had up to that point been considered binding and taken very \r\nseriously internally by me and other OpenAI employees. \r\n6. The Charter was positioned as the foundational document guiding all of our strategic \r\ndecisions during my time at OpenAI. Senior leaders such as Sam Altman and Greg Brockman \r\nCase 4:24-cv-04722-YGR Document 152 Filed 04/11/25 Page 19 of 21","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 20 / 21>","1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n20\r\n21\r\n22\r\n23\r\n24\r\n25\r\n26\r\n27\r\n28\r\n2\r\nregularly referenced the Charter to explain operational and organizational decisions or to address \r\nquestions about how OpenAI was developing AGI. \r\n7. In fact, there was a dedicated working group at OpenAI devoted to interpreting and \r\napplying the Charter in concrete terms. Employee understanding of the Charter was made part of \r\nour performance evaluations after the transition of OpenAI even to a capped for-profit structure. \r\nEmployees at all levels were evaluated not just on their technical contributions but also on how well \r\nthey aligned their work with the Charter\u2019s principles and ensured their colleagues did the same. \r\n8. As repeated by OpenAI executives both internally and externally, OpenAI\u2019s \r\nnonprofit structure, and in particular the nonprofit\u2019s control over all for-profit subsidiaries, was\r\ngenerally considered essential to OpenAI upholding its Charter commitments. \r\n9. The Charter also played an important role in enhancing the organization\u2019s brand \r\nidentity. Physical copies of the Charter were prominently displayed throughout the offices. It was \r\nconsistently visible in brochures, guest offerings, and new-hire packets. \r\n10. When OpenAI began to lose key staff in 2020, Sam Altman repeatedly turned to and \r\nemphasized the importance of the Charter and OpenAI\u2019s unique nonprofit control structure to retain \r\ntalent. \r\n11. Particularly after OpenAI\u2019s capped-profit transition, nonprofit control and adherence \r\nto the Charter were important for attracting talent\u2014especially the gifted researchers concerned with \r\nAI safety and the societal impacts of AI. \r\n12. The repeated representations by Sam Altman and other OpenAI executives \r\nconcerning OpenAI\u2019s charitable mission and adherence to the Charter persuaded me to stay at \r\nOpenAI longer than I otherwise would have. \r\n13. When I saw Sam Altman and other senior leaders directly lie to employees about the \r\ncompany\u2019s transparency practices, I realized that they had also lied to us about many other important \r\ndecisions and key elements of the company. I realized the Charter had been used as a smokescreen, \r\nsomething to attract and retain idealistic talent while providing no real check on OpenAI\u2019s growth \r\nand its pursuit of AGI.\r\n14.

Samuel Altman et al.** argues strongly against a proposed restructuring of OpenAI that could remove the Nonprofit entity's governance and controlling role over its for-profit subsidiaries. Below is a precise and comprehensive summary and analysis of the brief.\n\n### **Overview of the Amicus Brief**\n- Submitted by former OpenAI employees, represented by attorney Lester Lessig.\n- Filed in support of Plaintiffs (Musk et al.) opposing OpenAI\u2019s motions to dismiss the lawsuit.\n- Emphasizes the foundational importance of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit status and Charter in guiding the company's mission and strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Main Arguments of the Brief**\n\n#### **1. Importance of the Nonprofit Mission**\n- OpenAI was founded explicitly as a nonprofit organization, with the mission to **\"ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.\"**\n- This mission was formally documented in OpenAI's founding documents and repeatedly reinforced internally.\n- The Charter explicitly commits OpenAI to principles including:\n  - Broadly distributed benefits (preventing concentration of power).\n  - Ensuring long-term safety (prioritizing humanity over financial gain).\n  - Maintaining technical leadership.\n  - Cooperative orientation and collaboration in AGI research.\n\n#### **2. Nonprofit Control as Crucial**\n- The Nonprofit\u2019s complete control over its subsidiaries was considered critical to fulfilling its mission. This control structure allowed the Nonprofit to prioritize the Charter and the broader interests of humanity over purely financial motives.\n- The brief highlights how this governance structure was clearly articulated in legal documents and public statements by leadership, including Sam Altman's Senate testimony in 2023.\n\n#### **3. Nonprofit Status and Charter as Talent Magnets**\n- The Nonprofit governance structure and Charter significantly aided OpenAI in recruiting and retaining talent, particularly researchers concerned about AI ethics and safety.\n- The assurance of Nonprofit control and adherence to the Charter provided a strong incentive for employees who feared commercial interests would override ethical commitments.\n- Many employees were explicitly persuaded to remain due to these commitments.\n\n#### **4. Proposed Restructuring as a Violation of Mission**\n- The brief explicitly criticizes OpenAI\u2019s recent move toward restructuring into a fully for-profit entity, arguing that it directly contradicts OpenAI\u2019s foundational Charter.\n- The removal of Nonprofit control would violate:\n  - The commitment to distribute AGI\u2019s benefits broadly.\n  - The \u201cmerge-and-assist\u201d clause, obligating OpenAI to prioritize cooperation and safety over competition in AGI development.\n- The brief emphasizes a lack of mention of the Charter in recent restructuring announcements, suggesting that OpenAI is aware of the conflict between its original commitments and its current actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Declarations Highlighted**\n- **Todor M. Markov**, a former OpenAI researcher now working at Anthropic, provided a declaration criticizing OpenAI\u2019s leadership:\n  - Markov detailed losing trust in OpenAI due to perceived dishonesty from leadership, specifically regarding undisclosed non-disparagement agreements required to retain equity.\n  - Markov and other employees viewed OpenAI's commitments as sincere and central to its identity; discovering otherwise led to significant disillusionment.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Call to Action**\n- The brief concludes that allowing the restructuring would be:\n  - A severe breach of trust with stakeholders (employees, donors, public).\n  - An abandonment of the nonprofit\u2019s core mission and ethical commitments.\n- It strongly urges the Court to reject any restructuring that removes the Nonprofit\u2019s governing control, emphasizing this as essential to holding OpenAI accountable for its stated charitable purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Legal Significance and Broader Implications**\n- This brief provides critical context for understanding internal dynamics and original intentions behind OpenAI's formation and structure.\n- It raises substantial ethical and legal concerns regarding corporate governance, particularly in cases involving significant technological advancements with wide-ranging societal impacts.\n- The filing underscores the broader tension between ethical commitments in AI research and commercial pressures, potentially setting significant precedents for future legal and regulatory frameworks around AI governance.\n\n---\n\n### **Impact and Strategic Insight**\n- The involvement of former OpenAI employees and detailed insider accounts lend considerable credibility and weight to the Plaintiffs' case against OpenAI.\n- Public scrutiny of this case and the contents of this brief may influence public perception and regulatory interest in AI governance and accountability practices in major tech organizations.\n\nOverall, the brief strongly advocates for the preservation of OpenAI\u2019s original nonprofit structure as vital to its ethical mission, emphasizing that restructuring risks severe ethical, legal, and reputational harm."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"ea1cdd57-2c21-4384-ab47-3e471e00ab2b","request_id":"92eed43f9dfb6017-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ea1cdd57-2c21-4384-ab47-3e471e00ab2b","children":[]}}}
