Not really. It felt more bearish than panicky.\r\nAgain, panicky is more than 90% of the volume on the downside, and I know you\u2019ll think I am \r\nbeing picky, but we got 88%. It really needs to feel like there is nowhere to hide, and today, there \r\nwas much hiding in the staples and utes.\r\nThe VIX, though, made its way to 30. Now, at least, it sits poised to get jumpy. Jumpy really is a \r\nsubjective term, but for me, it has to look as if the chart is breaking out of a base, and if you were \r\na momentum player, you would want to jump on board. So, look at the chart of the VIX: it has \r\nthe chance to get jumpy in the next few days.\r\nEven the put/call ratio joined in today with the reading at 1.16. This is only the second reading \r\nover 1.0 since the market started down seven weeks ago. A few more readings like this and the \r\nten-day moving average should finally get going. Notice for all the chatter about bearishness; it \r\nis still well below where it was last summer when it shot up to 1.06.

The ISE \r\ncall/put ratio gave us a reading under 1.0. The QQQs traded nearly 120 million shares.\r\nNot quantifiable, we also had folks finally selling their staples, utes, REITs and even the non-US \r\nstocks got sold.

That\u2019s what I feel like. Why is that 90% down volume \r\nday so elusive?\r\nI wish I knew, but we managed to get 88% of the volume on the downside Thursday. Some might \r\nsay that is close enough, but Thursday felt more like persistent selling rather than panic.\r\nHere\u2019s one way we saw it: on March 28thNasdaq had 77% of the volume on the downside. That \r\nday, Nasdaq was down 480 points. On Thursday, we saw 71% of the volume on the downside, \r\nwith Nasdaq down over 1000 points. So there was a bigger rush to sell last Friday than there was \r\non Thursday.\r\nThis is not to say there was no selling. There was plenty of it, just not really panicky.\r\nThe put/call ratio finally shot up and chimed in at 1.16. As a reminder, since this decline began \r\nin February, this is only the second reading over 1.0. This means the ten-day moving average is \r\nstill relatively low in that it sits at .94. Look at the chart and you can see we had more put buying \r\nlast fall. And significantly more in August when the ten-day moving average shot up to 1.06. But \r\nat least Thursday\u2019s reading was a positive change.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 8 / 33>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-719oiwxmWxfupDnRMVGzKo","size_bytes":74700,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":512,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 33>","The other day I fussed over a reading under 1.0 in the ISE call/put ratio.

Several readings under 1.0 and this would fall in a hurry, but the call buyers remain active.\r\nThe NAAIM folks did finally do some giving up as they reduced their exposure to 54. This is the \r\nlowest in a year. But as you can see on the chart, the surveys such as AAII and Investors \r\nIntelligence show bearishness closer to where this was in the fall of 2023 (25).\r\nNow this questionnaire is concluded on Wednesday at midday, so it does not include Thursday. \r\nIt\u2019s possible next week it will be significantly lower.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 9 / 33>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-RSTnxXCEb2unq24GmbeGPq","size_bytes":64473,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":512,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 10 / 33>","Then there is the Daily Sentiment Index (DSI).

Once again, it has the chance to get low enough for us to fuss over. \r\nThe skeleton waits.\r\nThe VIX has moved to the starting line, so to speak, as it sits right at 30. If it can get going and \r\nstart to look like a breakout, I think I might be able to call it jumpy. Again, this is very subjective.\r\nLet me end by noting the Russell 2000 is now down more than 20%.

We should still rally. I simply think a market that panics leads to a \r\nbetter rally.\r\nWhat would you buy for a rally? Technology. I highlighted the SOX the other day because that is \r\nthe most oversold. But I could have gone with any of the tech stocks because they are where the \r\nmajority of the selling has been. In an oversold rally, the oversold tend to be bought.\r\nWill the rally last longer than a day? Yes, I believe so. I also believe it will be choppy (no panic \r\nequals more chop).\r\nHow long will it last? I don\u2019t know right now. My initial thought is a week or so. The Nasdaq Hi\u0002Lo Indicator is back to an oversold condition. We saw yesterday the 30-day moving average of \r\nthe advance/decline line is a little bit oversold now too.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 33>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-VNfNThUem7hKoN9D9bBEiJ","size_bytes":59897,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":512,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 33>","Are we in a bear market? By the definition most give it (down 20%), the answer would be no. \r\nBut, the majority of stocks have been heading down since October (see the McClellan \r\nSummation Index below). That is not bull market action. So, call it what you want, but the \r\nRussell is down 18%. Do you really need to wait for another two percent to say it\u2019s been bear \r\nmarket action?\r\nWe entered this year with my view that we would be in a trading not a trending market. I still \r\nthink that is the case.\r\nAnd the final question is, naturally, what I think about the tariffs. You don\u2019t need my personal \r\nview on them, what you should know is that when we are given a deadline in the market\u2014think \r\ngovernment shutdown, debt ceiling, etc., we tend to prepare in advance for this deadline. I \r\nsuspect much of the selling we\u2019ve seen was prepping for it. If, for some reason, the market \r\nfreaks out anyway, and we get some panic, well, heck, that would be good news, not bad.\r\nWhile I think tech is the most oversold and therefore what is likely to rally, I also think there are a \r\nlot of big tops in those stocks, so this is about trading them and as they get to resistance, selling \r\nthem.\r\nOne final word on Gold. The DSI pushed down to 80 so it is not (for now) in danger of seeing the \r\nDSI push over 90. It is, however, overbought, and there has been an awful lot of attention given \r\nto it. A correction is needed.\r\nNew Ideas\r\nI was asked a few weeks ago about American Express (AXP) , and I thought it would rally to the \r\n290 area where I would sell it.

Is this never-ending correction finally done? Here\u2019s a partial list of what I like to see \r\nto get really excited about a low in the market. And what we got.\r\nHigh downside volume, preferably a 90% day. It shows panic. We did not get that.\r\nA super high put/call ratio; a reading well over 1.0 is good, preferably for several days, which gets \r\nthe ten-day moving average of this ratio over 1.0. That shows panic. We did not get that.\r\nWhat we did get in terms of the put/call ratio was that last Thursday saw the equity put/call ratio \r\nsoar to .94. I consider that a positive as it finally showed a modicum of panic or at least a strong \r\ndesire to hedge.\r\nMy intermediate-term indicators are grossly oversold. We have one, maybe two, that are \r\noversold (Nasdaq\u2019s Hi-Lo \u2013shown below--and the Volume Indicator, which got to 46% but got to \r\n45% in January).\r\nIt would also be nice if my mother called about the market (this is part tongue in cheek and part \r\nvery real). She has not called regarding the market.\r\nMore bears than bulls in the AAII survey. We\u2019ve had that for three straight weeks. As a reminder, I \r\nmostly think this survey is garbage but when it is confirmed by other surveys/indicators it is \r\nuseful. The 4-week moving average of bears is now at 59% which is historically high and \r\ntherefore bullish.\r\nMore bears than bulls in the Investors Intelligence survey. We got that last Wednesday for the \r\nfirst time since the fall of 2022. That makes it bullish. We also had such a reading in the spring of \r\n2022, and it was bullish, for a few weeks. It was good for a decent trading rally.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 33>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-MhrUmBTEXw2ei7NXbq62Ve","size_bytes":83218,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":512,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 33>","The NAAIM Exposure is low.

In October 2023 that \r\nlevel got to 24 and in October 2022 it got to 12.\r\nI like to see fewer stocks making new lows. We have gotten that. The peak reading for new lows \r\ncame on March 4th so for two weeks the majority of stocks have been making higher lows.\r\nIt would also be nice if the Citi Panic/Euphoria Model would fall out of Euphoria. It has not. \r\nSometimes, I question if this indicator chart, which I extract from Barron\u2019s each weekend, is \r\ndelayed.

This too is a change in \r\nsentiment, but here again, they were at 36 in 2022.\r\nAway from that, Friday saw 90% of the volume on the upside. Was that panic to get in? Was it \r\npanic to cover shorts? I don\u2019t know, and I have seen studies that say a 90% up volume day can \r\nbe bullish, but if it arrives in a bear market, it isn\u2019t.

My sense is if we get an outsized rally early in the week, we will see sentiment \r\nshift away from bearishness pretty quickly, and that would be problematic for the market.

It \r\nmight be. In the futures. But I don\u2019t use futures. The indicators I use are not about price, they are \r\nwhat happens in the regular trading hours in the indicators.\r\nIn futures land we can\u2019t see what percentage of the trading in stocks is on the downside. We \r\ndon\u2019t get a put/call ratio in the overnight session. So the answer is if there was panic in the \r\nfutures, then so be it, but that\u2019s not what I would look for on my list.\r\nMy list, as you probably know by now but just in case you need a reminder, includes most of the \r\nfollowing.\r\nI would like to see 90% of the volume on the downside. We have not seen that since December \r\n18, the Fed Day that got everyone hysterical over three months ago. When people sell without \r\ndistinguishing this from that they are panicking. And that is what brings a rush of selling that \r\nleads to 90% (or more) of the volume on the downside. When they are already picking through \r\nthe decline to sort what they want to buy, they are not panicking.\r\nLast Monday we saw 83% of the volume on the downside but that down open was quickly \r\nbought. As I noted at the time, it felt more like a panic to get in than one to get out.\r\nNext up I would like to see the VIX get jumpy. This is a very subjective point. Yes, the VIX got to 65 \r\nin August but it\u2018s less about the level and more about the look. Do you see the way it surged and \r\nlooked as if it was breaking out? Sort of the way one of those penny stocks looks. That\u2019s the \r\nlook. So let\u2019s start with a VIX over 30, but it\u2019s more that it should look like it is breaking out of an \r\nextended base and that momentum traders would love to jump on the breakout.\r\nI would also like to see the put/call ratio well over 1.0. At prior panics we\u2019ve seen readings up in \r\nthe 1.20 area. Thus far, since the high in February, we have seen exactly one reading over 1.0 \r\nand that was a measly 1.02.\r\nWhen folks sell with wild abandon (90% downside volume) and they are buying puts fast and \r\nfuriously we know there is a whiff of panic in the air.\r\nOf course if we get panic along with some positive divergence like fewer stocks making new \r\nlows, that would be a positive divergence. As a reminder, earlier this week the Nasdaq saw 702 \r\nstocks making new lows so that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for: fewer than 702 new lows on the \r\nNasdaq. For the NYSE that number is 289.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 20 / 33>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-XsDVDscE2xaQTTYBZRKTQU","size_bytes":98235,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":512,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 33>","Without panic we get more of what we\u2019ve gotten: chop until we use up the oversold condition.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 21 / 33>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-MqTYG6r2n8RXAsbcDpPTJN","size_bytes":54117,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":512,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 33>","Are the Tariffs Old News?\r\nPeople have talked about tariffs for so long now, that all of the news may already be reflected in \r\nstocks' prices.\r\n\u2022 Helene Meisler\r\n\u2022 Apr 2, 2025 6:00 AM EDT\r\nFollow\r\nComments\r\n\u2022\r\n\u2022\r\n\u2022\r\n\u2022\r\n\u2022\r\nThe market has a thing about deadlines.

How can you \r\ncompare a market that has fallen 20% (2018) with one that has fallen 10%? (now) I just don\u2019t see \r\nthe comparison.\r\nI\u2019ll cut to the chase. I do not think we saw panic on Monday morning. I know folks were bearish \r\nMonday morning, no doubt about it. Had they opened the market with 90% of the volume on the \r\ndownside, I would say, okay, they acted on said bearishness. But instead, we barely got over \r\n80% before the buying started.\r\nNow let me point out that Nasdaq did not see a positive divergence in that the number of stocks \r\nmaking new lows crept up over 700 vs mid-March\u2019s reading of 688. The good news is that the \r\nNYSE did see a positive divergence with 276 new lows vs. 289 in mid-March, so it was a \r\nsqueaker.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 26 / 33>","Remember back in mid-March when we finally saw the volume in the QQQs surge to 75 million \r\nshares?

The \r\nISE call/put ratio was .99 on Monday. To me, this is a big deal. I realize there is not much \r\ndifference between .99 and 1.0, but we have not seen a reading under 1.0 since the August low. \r\nThat\u2019s a long time.

However, over the last six weeks, it has been trending lower, \r\nand that means the ten-day moving average is now closing in on 1.6.

Below is a consolidated list of the main indicators she references, **omitting her discussion of individual stocks**:\n\n1. **Put/Call Ratios**  \n   - **CBOE Put/Call Ratio (total and equity\u2010only)**: She notes readings above 1.0 (especially in the 1.15\u20131.20 range) as signals of elevated put activity, which can coincide with capitulation or \u201cpanic selling.\u201d  \n   - **ISE Call/Put Ratio**: She also monitors the daily and 21\u2010day averages from the ISE; readings below 1.0 are of particular interest, as they may mark a shift from heavy call buying to more defensive positioning.\n\n2. **VIX (Volatility Index)**  \n   - She looks for a \u201cjumpy\u201d VIX\u2014where the chart appears to be \u201cbreaking out\u201d above key levels (e.g., over 30)\u2014to indicate that fear or volatility has moved sharply higher.\n\n3. **Downside/Upside Volume Extremes**  \n   - **90% Down (or Up) Volume Days**: She treats a day where 90% or more of trading volume occurs on the downside (or upside) as an important signal of panic\u2010type selling or buying.\n\n4. **New Highs/New Lows and \u201cHi\u2010Lo Indicator\u201d**  \n   - The count of **new 52\u2010week lows** on the NYSE or Nasdaq is an important gauge of market\u2010wide weakness.  \n   - The **Nasdaq and NYSE Hi\u2010Lo Indicators** (e.g., readings under 0.15) mark oversold conditions in breadth.\n\n5. **McClellan Summation Index**  \n   - Measures broader participation in advances/declines. She highlights when the Summation Index is trending down versus turning up, as well as how close it might be to an oversold extreme.\n\n6. **Overbought/Oversold Oscillators**  \n   - She publishes **Oscillators for the NYSE and Nasdaq** to see if the market is short\u2010term overbought or oversold.\n\n7. **Momentum Indicator (Nasdaq)**  \n   - A custom measure that projects when Nasdaq\u2019s momentum may \u201cturn up\u201d or \u201cturn down\u201d based on plugging in hypothetical lower or higher closes over a set period.\n\n8. **Sentiment Surveys and Models**  \n   - **AAII Bulls vs. Bears**: Looks at whether bears exceed bulls, and also tracks the 4\u2010week average.  \n   - **Investors Intelligence**: Watches for crossovers (e.g., more bears than bulls).  \n   - **NAAIM Exposure Index**: Focuses on active managers\u2019 equity exposure; levels under ~50 can signal risk\u2010off behavior.  \n   - **Citi Panic/Euphoria Model** (referenced when it was still in \u201cEuphoria\u201d territory).  \n   - **Market Vane & Consensus Bulls**: Surveys that track percentage of bullish advisors or traders.\n\n9. **Daily Sentiment Index (DSI)**  \n   - Watches the DSI on major indexes (S&P, Nasdaq) looking for readings in the teens or single digits, which often coincide with an oversold market and a potential rebound.\n\n10. **90% (or More) Downside Days in \u201cStaples,\u201d \u201cUtes,\u201d and Other \u2018Hidey Holes\u2019**  \n   - She looks for selling to become sufficiently broad\u2010based, sweeping even traditionally defensive sectors (e.g., consumer staples, utilities), to confirm capitulation\u2010style selling.\n\n11. **Volume in Index ETFs (e.g., QQQ)**  \n   - Surges in volume (especially in vehicles like the QQQ) during selloffs can be taken as a sign of climactic activity or heightened fear.\n\n12. **Reference to a \u201cSentiment Cycle\u201d**  \n   - She shows a psychological \u201cSentiment Cycle\u201d chart indicating stages such as \u201cBuy the dip,\u201d \u201cPanic,\u201d \u201cDespondency,\u201d etc. She tries to locate the market\u2019s current emotional state within this schematic.\n\nIn sum, **Meisler\u2019s market calls revolve around sentiment (surveys, put/call ratios, VIX, downside\u2010volume days), breadth and momentum (McClellan Summation, Hi\u2010Lo Indicators, Oscillators), and oversold/overbought clues (DSI, 90% down days).** She synthesizes these inputs to judge whether the market is likely to stage a rebound or continue trending lower."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"b3d04422-e39f-42c0-baa7-cbed3c471b42","request_id":"92ca4639bf093db9-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b3d04422-e39f-42c0-baa7-cbed3c471b42","children":["6e7c15c4-fe21-449e-a1ab-40aa9b51029b"]},"6e7c15c4-fe21-449e-a1ab-40aa9b51029b":{"id":"6e7c15c4-fe21-449e-a1ab-40aa9b51029b","message":{"id":"6e7c15c4-fe21-449e-a1ab-40aa9b51029b","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1744037150.486,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Construct a summary table of the indicators used together with the critical levels which may trigger her to flag the market as bullish or bearish, and also whether she uses raw values or a calculated measure like a moving average.
