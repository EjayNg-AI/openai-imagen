What does \u201cintelligence too cheap to meter\u201d actually mean?\n\nAltman\u2019s phrase is a deliberate echo of the 1950s nuclear promise of \u201celectricity too cheap to meter,\u201d which came from US Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss and is now widely seen as emblematic over-optimism.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search8\ue201\n\nIn his 2025 \u201cGentle Singularity\u201d memo and public talks, Altman argues that rapid cost declines in AI make \u201cintelligence too cheap to meter\u2026 well within grasp,\u201d pointing to big price cuts for frontier models and projections to 2030.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search21\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search24\ue201  \n\nBut \u201ctoo cheap to meter\u201d is ambiguous:\n\n- **Literal interpretation:** the marginal cost of using extremely capable AI is so close to zero that nobody measures it at all \u2013 like breathing air.\n- **Practical interpretation:** for many tasks, the cost of calling very strong AI systems is tiny relative to the value they create, so people stop thinking about individual calls; it\u2019s bundled into devices, OSes, SaaS, etc.\n\nThe literal version is almost certainly a mirage; the practical one is much more defensible, and in some narrow domains we\u2019re already part-way there.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Where we actually are in 2025\n\nSome hard constraints to anchor the discussion:\n\n- **Energy per query.** Recent estimates put a typical GPT-4o-class ChatGPT query at ~0.3 watt-hours of electricity \u2013 about an order of magnitude less than early 2023 estimates, but still **~10\u00d7** a conventional web search.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search18\ue201\n- **System-level energy use.** Data centres used about **1.5% of global electricity in 2024**, and AI is pushing that up fast. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects data-centre electricity demand to more than double by 2030 and continue rising thereafter.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n- **Visible grid stress.** Multiple countries are already debating whether AI-driven data-centre growth will strain grids and complicate net-zero targets; Australia and India are good examples.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news40\ue202turn0news42\ue201\n\nSo yes: **cost per unit of inference is falling** (chip efficiency + algorithms + economies of scale + price cuts), but **aggregate cost and resource usage are *rising*** because demand is exploding.\n\nThat\u2019s already one warning sign against the strong form of \u201ctoo cheap to meter\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Fundamental constraints: physics and infrastructure\n\n### 3.1 Physics: you don\u2019t get intelligence for free\n\nThere is a hard physical lower bound on the energy required for irreversible computation, given by Landauer\u2019s principle: erasing one bit of information requires at least \\(k_B T \\ln 2\\) joules, about \\(2.8\\times10^{-21}\\) J/bit at room temperature.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \n\nModern chips are still **many orders of magnitude** above this limit, so there is huge headroom, but the limit is:\n\n- **Non-zero** \u2013 you cannot have arbitrarily large computation for literally zero energy.\n- **Global-constraint-sensitive** \u2013 if you want a civilization that runs *truly enormous* amounts of AI, you run into planetary energy, cooling and materials constraints.\n\nSo \u201cintelligence too cheap to meter\u201d cannot mean \u201carbitrarily much intelligence with negligible physical cost\u201d. At best it means \u201cfor a *given* amount of intelligence, its energy cost is tiny relative to our overall energy and economic budget\u201d.\n\n### 3.2 Infrastructure: data centres and grids\n\nEven before hitting physical limits, there are infrastructure bottlenecks:\n\n- The IEA\u2019s base-case suggests data-centre electricity for AI and cloud could pass **1,000 TWh/year by 2030** and reach ~1,300 TWh by 2035.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search23\ue201  \n- In some regions, AI data-centre clusters are already pushing up local power prices and forcing grid upgrades, prompting political backlash.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news39\ue202turn0news41\ue202turn0news43\ue201  \n\nEven if individual inferences become very cheap, *scaling up to civilization-wide \u201cAI in everything, all the time\u201d* is not free. You pay in:\n\n- Transmission lines, substations, and grid-hardening.\n- Water and land for cooling.\n- Extensive capital expenditure on accelerators and supporting hardware.\n\nSo there\u2019s a structural reason providers will keep metering or bundling usage: they need to recover massive fixed costs.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Economic realities: cheap \u2260 unmetered\n\nEven if we imagine a world where:\n\n- Energy per token is dramatically lower;\n- Chips are much more efficient;\n- Training costs have plateaued;\n\nyou still have **economic** reasons to meter:\n\n1. **Capital recovery and rents.** Building and operating hyperscale AI clusters is capital-intensive. As long as there are only a handful of operators at the real frontier, they will almost certainly charge above marginal cost and meter usage to recover CAPEX and earn returns.\n\n2. **Jevons effects.** When something becomes cheaper, total consumption tends to skyrocket. We already see this: cheaper tokens lead to *more* tokens overall, so total cost and total electricity usage go up, not down.\n\n3. **Regulation & liability.** Powerful AI will likely be treated more like aviation or pharmaceuticals than like free email. That tends to **push towards tighter control and metering**, not away from it.\n\n4. **Price discrimination.** If AI is valuable, firms will want to segment markets (enterprise vs hobbyist, safety-critical vs casual usage). That is hard to do if you genuinely don\u2019t meter.\n\nSo the historical analogy is closer to nuclear or renewables: **fuel may be cheap; the service is still priced and metered**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Where abundance *is* plausible\n\nThat said, there\u2019s a weaker, more interesting interpretation where Altman is *partly* right.\n\nBreak \u201cintelligence\u201d into layers:\n\n1. **Raw cognitive tokens** \u2013 the core LLM (large language model) / policy network doing reasoning and text generation.\n2. **Wrapped cognitive services** \u2013 retrieval, tools, autonomy, memory, integration with enterprise systems.\n3. **Full \u201cdigital employees\u201d** \u2013 processes that own P&L, interact with regulators, interface with messy real-world data and humans.\n\nThe slogan mostly applies to **layer 1**, maybe parts of **layer 2**, not layer 3.\n\n### 5.1 Layer 1: raw tokens\n\nWe already see:\n\n- Rapid price cuts for frontier models and specialized reasoning models (OpenAI\u2019s o-series, Anthropic, etc.).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search21\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- Significant energy-efficiency improvements: per-query energy for GPT-4o-class systems has fallen by about an order of magnitude relative to early estimates.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search22\ue201  \n\nIf algorithmic efficiency and hardware progress continue at something like their current pace, it's quite plausible that:\n\n- **The cost of \u201cone hour of PhD-level cognitive work\u201d equivalent** from an AI system becomes much lower than the fully-loaded cost of a human worker in developed economies.\n- For many consumer and office tasks, AI assistance is bundled into operating systems, productivity suites and devices so per-prompt metering disappears from the user\u2019s point of view.\n\nIn that sense, **for many everyday tasks intelligence becomes \u201ccheap enough that you don\u2019t think about individual calls\u201d** \u2013 which is close to the practical meaning of the slogan.\n\n### 5.2 Layer 2\u20133: wrapped services and \u201cAI workers\u201d\n\nHowever, once you move to more realistic \u201cAI that does real jobs\u201d:\n\n- You need **data acquisition and cleaning**, integration with legacy systems, domain-specific tuning, governance, monitoring, human-in-the-loop oversight, incident response, etc.\n- You hit **Goodhart-style problems**: reward hacking, misalignment between metrics and true goals, brittleness in out-of-distribution conditions.\n- You incur **liability**: if an AI trading system, medical assistant, or autonomous agent causes harm, someone pays.\n\nThose costs **do not scale down with FLOPs in a simple way**. In fact, they can grow as systems get more powerful and are trusted with higher-stakes decisions.\n\nSo even if raw intelligence tokens become very cheap, **end-to-end \u201cdigital employees\u201d that you can truly trust will remain scarce and expensive** for a long time.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Scenario sketch\n\nVery roughly (guesses, not predictions):\n\n### By ~2030\n\n- **Raw inference** for GPT-5/6-class models is vastly cheaper per unit of capability than in 2023\u201324.\n- Consumer-facing \u201ccopilot\u201d-style assistance is bundled into almost every productivity app and operating system; per-prompt pricing retreats to specialized or high-end use cases.\n- However, **frontier-grade models** and high-throughput APIs are still clearly metered and priced; energy and grid constraints are visible and politically salient.\n\n### 2030\u20132050\n\nThree broad possibilities:\n\n1. **Abundant-but-controlled** (arguably the most likely):\n   - Massive efficiency gains and new hardware (ASICs, maybe some neuromorphic or photonic computing) drive inference cost down.\n   - But global data-centre electricity reaches several percent of total generation; AI clusters are treated as critical infrastructure.\n   - Frontier-grade reasoning is cheap *relative to output*, but still heavily metered, regulated and concentrated in a small number of providers.\n\n2. **Constrained plateau**:\n   - Energy, climate and geopolitics slow down deployment of ever-larger clusters.\n   - Algorithmic progress gives diminishing returns; you get better models, but not orders-of-magnitude cheaper cognition.\n   - Intelligence is cheaper than today but remains clearly a paid, metered resource.\n\n3. **Bifurcation**:\n   - On-device and mid-tier models become almost free and ubiquitous, giving \u201cgood-enough\u201d intelligence everywhere.\n   - Frontier systems with truly extraordinary capabilities are rare, expensive, and regulated like nuclear facilities.\n   - For most people, intelligence *feels* too cheap to meter; for critical applications, it very much is not.\n\nI\u2019d weight 1 and 3 much higher than 2, but in all three, the nuclear-style literal interpretation doesn\u2019t occur.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Lessons from the nuclear analogy\n\nThe original \u201celectricity too cheap to meter\u201d failed less because physics disappointed and more because:\n\n- **Capital costs, regulatory overhead and risk management** dominated;\n- Public tolerance for catastrophic downside risk was low;\n- Political and institutional structures weren\u2019t optimized for radical abundance.\n\nThose same structural issues will show up for very powerful AI:\n\n- Safety concerns, weaponization risk, economic disruption and systemic fragility will provoke regulation.\n- Capital markets will not voluntarily give up rents from scarce, high-value infrastructure.\n- Externalities (energy, emissions, labour displacement) will be politicised.\n\nSo as with nuclear, you can get **very cheap marginal cost** while still living in a world where the service is *decidedly not* \u201ctoo cheap to meter\u201d in the everyday sense.\n\n---\n\n## 8. So: pipe dream or achievable?\n\nIf we interpret the slogan as:\n\n> \u201cBy 2030\u20132050, society will have access to arbitrarily capable intelligence that is essentially free to use, with no need to meter or price it.\u201d\n\nthen I\u2019d say **that is a pipe dream**. It collides with:\n\n- Non-zero physical limits on computation;\n- Energy and infrastructure constraints;\n- Economic incentives around capital-intensive infrastructure;\n- Governance, safety and liability considerations.\n\nIf we instead interpret it as:\n\n> \u201cBy 2030\u20132050, the *marginal cost* of a lot of high-quality cognitive labour will be so low that, for many applications, we barely think about the cost per query and bundle it into other services.\u201d\n\nthen I\u2019d call that **plausible and partially underway already**.\n\nThe real action then moves to other scarcities:\n\n- High-quality data and sensor coverage;\n- Reliable integration with the messy physical and institutional world;\n- Human attention, trust and willingness to delegate;\n- Energy, land and grid capacity;\n- Political legitimacy and governance.\n\nIn other words, **intelligence may get relatively cheap, but it will not make the world post-scarcity. It just shifts the bottlenecks.**\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can quantify it a bit more next: for example, \u201cwhat if one hour of \u2018AI PhD-equivalent work\u2019 cost \\$0.01 vs \\$100 \u2013 what sectors actually become constrained by something else first?\u201d  \n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent coverage on data-centre energy and AI\ue202turn0news39,turn0news40,turn0news41,turn0news42,turn0news43\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search8\ue201","start_idx":434,"end_idx":466,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_cheap_to_meter","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_cheap_to_meter?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2024/08/too-cheap-to-meter-the-infamous-nuclear-power-misquote/","https://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2024/08/too-cheap-to-meter-the-infamous-nuclear-power-misquote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_cheap_to_meter?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Too cheap to meter","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_cheap_to_meter?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"\u201cToo cheap to meter\u201d \u2013 the infamous nuclear power phrase\u2026","url":"https://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2024/08/too-cheap-to-meter-the-infamous-nuclear-power-misquote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"30 Aug 2024 \u2014 The most infamous words are undoubtedly \u201ctoo cheap to meter.\u201d The origin of this phrase is a speech given on September 16, 1954 by Lewis L.

Currently using about 2% of the national electricity supply, data centres are forecast to consume 6% by 2030 and 12% by 2050. This surge is fueled by the growing adoption of generative AI and the expansion of hyperscale facilities, which can each use as much power as 100,000 households annually. Most data centres are clustered in New South Wales and Victoria, where they could account for up to 11% and 8% of electricity demand respectively by 2030.\n\nExperts warn that this growth could hinder the transition from fossil fuels by increasing grid reliance on coal and gas, especially since renewable energy output often doesn't match the constant demand of data centres. This rising demand also risks pushing up electricity costs and stalling emissions reductions. The Australian government is developing policy principles to ensure data centre development is accompanied by renewable energy and water sustainability investments. However, analysts caution that if renewable deployment doesn\u2019t keep pace, Australia's climate targets may become unachievable.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"India File: $100 billion data centre boom tests resource limits","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-file-100-billion-data-centre-boom-tests-resource-limits-2025-12-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"India is witnessing a massive $100 billion data centre investment boom, fueled by growing data consumption in the country. Major conglomerates like Reliance Industries, Adani Group, and the Tata Group are investing heavily in AI data centre infrastructure, particularly in Andhra Pradesh. The projects plan to add gigawatt-scale capacity to India's relatively underdeveloped data centre landscape. Despite having 20% of global data, the country has only about 6% of global data centre capacity.\n\nHowever, this surge in investment faces serious challenges due to limited resources. Power and water supply shortages in key hubs such as Mumbai and Chennai\u2014already resource-stressed\u2014are potential risks. Data centres are highly resource-dependent, with electric demand expected to rise sharply and water consumption for cooling projected to be substantial. There are concerns about sustainability, with previous large infrastructure projects having failed due to similar resource constraints.\n\nMeanwhile, India's economy posted stronger-than-expected GDP growth of 8.2% in Q3, driven by exports and private spending. This has complicated monetary policy decisions, with the central bank now reassessing the need for interest rate cuts despite low inflation.

This surge is largely attributed to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, resulting in more and larger data centers being planned, with many expected to exceed 100 megawatts in power usage. Currently, only about 10% of data centers consume over 50 megawatts. The expansion may strain already stressed urban grids, pushing developers to build in rural and suburban areas, potentially impacting local environments and increasing energy costs for consumers.\n\nThe report by BloombergNEF also highlights that fiber infrastructure and the repurposing of former cryptocurrency mining sites are enabling this transition. States like Virginia, Georgia, and Ohio are leading development efforts due to their existing tech infrastructure.

This represents a significant 36% rise from earlier projections made in April, signaling the rapid growth of the sector. However, the revised estimate is still considered conservative compared to predictions from other firms like Goldman Sachs, BCG, and McKinsey. The surge in demand is closely linked to expansive trends in technology, particularly the growing role of artificial intelligence (AI), strongly backed by both major tech companies and the Trump administration. This rapid expansion is raising concerns over potential strain on local power grids and broader energy systems, contributing to rising electricity prices and a growing backlash in some regions affected by increased energy consumption.","attribution":"Axios"},{"title":"Energy Secretary Says Data-Center Boom Will Drive Down Power Costs","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/energy-secretary-says-data-center-boom-will-drive-down-power-costs-2db6140e?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright addressed concerns about the growing number of AI-powered data centers driving up electricity prices, asserting instead that their expansion will lead to cheaper electricity by encouraging increased energy production.

However, some areas like New Jersey and Northern Virginia\u2014major data-center hubs\u2014have already seen electricity prices rise, with New Jersey power rates up 19% year-over-year in August and a nationwide increase of 6%.\n\nA Carnegie Mellon study estimated that data center growth could raise electricity bills by 8% nationally and up to 25% in some regions by 2030. Utilities are increasingly asking tech firms like Google and Microsoft to contribute more toward grid connection expenses. Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner David Rosner stressed the importance of expanding grid access to compete in AI development.

Direct monetary / technical costs\n\n### 1.1 API usage (Application Programming Interface) for math research\n\nEven with falling prices, serious math work is *token-hungry*:\n\n- Large contexts (100k+ tokens) to feed in your notes, drafts, and references.\n- Multiple \u201cchains\u201d of calls: search \u2192 sketch \u2192 refine \u2192 check \u2192 re-check with a different model.\n- Long exploratory sessions where most of the output is *discarded*.\n\nEven if **cost per million tokens** drops by another 10\u2013100\u00d7 from here, if you do:\n\n- ~1\u20135 million tokens/day of \u201cserious\u201d work  \n- across multiple models (a \u201csynthesizer\u201d and \u201cdiscriminator\u201d),  \n- for years,\n\nyou\u2019re still looking at a **recurring monthly bill that is non-trivial at individual income scale**. Think tens to hundreds of US dollars per month for a fairly intensive individual research program, unless you deliberately cap usage.\n\nThat\u2019s affordable but not ignorable. You *will* meter yourself at some level: \u201cDo I really want to run another 50-step search over this problem, or is this good enough?\u201d\n\n### 1.2 Hardware if you go local\n\nIf you decide to run open-source models locally or on rented GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) cloud:\n\n- A single high-end GPU box able to serve a strong open-weights reasoning model is still mid-four to low-five figures USD all-in (hardware + power + cooling over several years).\n- Cloud GPU rental remains structurally expensive because somebody is paying for:\n  - datacentre buildout,  \n  - power, cooling, networking,  \n  - and *risk* (idling capacity when demand dips).\n\nYou can absolutely get to a point where **\u201cgood enough for problem-solving and tutoring\u201d** models are cheap enough to run on a small desktop GPU or even on-device. But:\n\n- You\u2019ll always be trading **cost vs capability vs latency**.\n- You will not casually get *frontier-level* capabilities on your personal box unless you spend real money or accept large delays.\n\nSo: API vs local becomes an economic optimisation problem for you, not a non-issue.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Access gap to the real frontier\n\nI expect a **growing gap** between:\n\n- \u201cCommodity\u201d models (open weights, on-device, freely finetuned).\n- \u201cFrontier\u201d models (highest reasoning ability, multi-modal, maybe proto-agentic) that are:\n  - tightly controlled,\n  - heavily metered,\n  - subject to usage restrictions and region-based gating.\n\nFor a long-term individual math programme, the relevant hurdles:\n\n1. **Unequal access to the very best reasoning.**  \n   - The absolute top models may be limited to large institutional partners (big tech, national labs, certain universities).\n   - You might see \u201cconsumer\u201d or \u201cpro\u201d versions that are weaker or more restricted.\n\n2. **Policy friction.**  \n   As formal and informal safety regimes tighten, you may hit:\n   - restrictions on code synthesis around cryptography, security, or systems;  \n   - throttling on very large automated runs (e.g. proof search that looks like botnet behaviour);  \n   - \u201cacademic research only\u201d carve-outs that require institutional affiliation.\n\nIn other words: even if *in principle* \u201cintelligence is cheap\u201d, **access to the very best intelligence may be rationed by policy and partnerships, not just money**. As an independent, you\u2019ll be on the outside of some of that.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Integration and workflow costs\n\nThe phrase \u201ctoo cheap to meter\u201d hides a huge practical cost category: **getting AI to actually work with *your* stuff.**\n\n### 3.1 Ingesting your mathematical corpus\n\nYou\u2019ve already got:\n\n- a large LaTeX corpus,  \n- old lecture notes, problem sets, maybe a thesis,  \n- scattered PDFs, images, and hand-drawn diagrams.\n\nTo build a serious \u201cmath research copilot\u201d that knows your world, you need to:\n\n- parse LaTeX reliably,  \n- normalise notation, labels, references,  \n- maintain a knowledge graph / embeddings index that evolves as you write,  \n- keep everything versioned and reproducible.\n\nNone of this is \u201ctoo cheap to meter\u201d. Even if the core models are cheap, you pay in:\n\n- time (designing, building, and debugging the pipeline),\n- mental overhead (every change in your doc structure or toolchain can break the pipeline),\n- potential cash (if you use third-party tools / managed RAG systems).\n\nThis is an invisible but very real tax on small researchers who don\u2019t have an engineering team.\n\n### 3.2 Reproducibility and \u201cAI-native\u201d research\n\nIf your proofs and calculations rely heavily on AI assistance, you will face:\n\n- **Reproducibility headaches.**  \n  - Models change (weights, decoding, safety filters).  \n  - APIs deprecate.  \n  - \u201cThe model said X in May 2027\u201d is not a reproducible statement.\n\n- **Formalisation pressure.**  \n  The only robust answer is to push more of your serious work into:\n  - proof assistants (Lean, Coq, Isabelle, etc.),  \n  - or at least fully scripted notebooks / pipelines that future you can re-run.\n\nThat means **learning a second stack** (formal methods) just to make AI-assisted math acceptable to journals and to your own future self. That\u2019s a *skills cost* and a *time cost*.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Epistemic, career, and competitive hurdles in math\n\n### 4.1 Correctness and \u201ctrust budget\u201d\n\nEven if the marginal cost of asking a model for help is tiny, your **trust in its output is not free**.\n\nYou will need:\n\n- time to cross-check reasoning;  \n- redundancy (ask multiple models, or a model plus a proof assistant);  \n- a sense of when to trust vs when to be paranoid.\n\nAs models become more capable, the errors become rarer but also more subtle and harder to detect. That can be actively dangerous in deep maths: one undetected hallucinated lemma in the middle of a 50-page argument poisons everything.\n\nSo even if \u201ctokens\u201d are cheap, **epistemic vigilance remains expensive**.\n\n### 4.2 Output inflation and novelty\n\nIf everyone has access to:\n\n- cheap technical exposition,\n- automated computations,\n- assistance in writing proofs and survey papers,\n\nthen:\n\n- There will be a **flood of medium-quality work** (preprints, blog posts, lecture notes).\n- Journals and reviewers will raise the bar for what counts as \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d.\n\nYour comparative advantage as a human mathematician shifts away from:\n\n- routine proof-grinding, calculation, and exposition (these get automated),\n- towards:\n  - choosing *good* problems,  \n  - connecting distant areas,  \n  - enforcing genuinely high standards of rigour and taste.\n\nThat\u2019s not a cost in dollars, but it *is* a higher bar: **being \u201cgood\u201d may feel like being \u201cmediocre\u201d by future standards**, simply because you are competing with human+AI hybrids.\n\n### 4.3 Credit and perception\n\nYou will also hit fuzzy questions like:\n\n- \u201cHow much of this paper was written by you versus your AI tools?\u201d\n- \u201cIs this result really yours, or is it something anyone would get by prompting model X in the right way?\u201d\n\nAcademia and the math community will eventually converge on norms, but until then, independent researchers risk:\n\n- under-credit (people assume \u201cthe model did it\u201d), or  \n- over-scrutiny (\u201cis this actually correct if an individual + AI claims it?\u201d).\n\nThat\u2019s a reputational friction you\u2019ll need to manage deliberately.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Educational and small-business side: commoditisation and moat erosion\n\nOn the education + coding business front, the biggest hurdle isn\u2019t \u201ccan I afford AI?\u201d It\u2019s **\u201chow do I stay non-commoditised *when everyone else* can afford AI?\u201d**\n\n### 5.1 Content is going to zero-marginal value\n\nHandouts, worked examples, explanations, even customised worksheets:\n\n- will be trivially producible by anyone with access to a decent model;\n- will be mass-generated by EdTech platforms, MOE-adjacent tools, and global tuition brands;\n- will rapidly converge in quality for \u201cstandard\u201d material (secondary, JC, first-year undergraduate).\n\nYour costs here:\n\n- You\u2019ll *have* to use AI just to keep up with expectations (students and parents will assume high-quality materials are a given).\n- But AI will also **crater the market value** of much of the routine content you currently differentiate on.\n\nYour real moat will shift to:\n\n- your *brand and trust* as a human tutor,  \n- track record of student outcomes,  \n- and ability to orchestrate AI tools in a way that feels personalised, not generic.\n\n### 5.2 Platform power and distribution\n\nAs \u201cAI tutors\u201d and \u201cAI homework helpers\u201d get integrated into:\n\n- search engines,  \n- major learning platforms,  \n- device operating systems,\n\ndiscoverability will skew even more towards large platforms.\n\nYour hurdles:\n\n- Getting noticed at all (SEO, platform algorithms) when generic AI help is one click away.\n- Potential future rules about using student data with third-party AI (data-protection regulations, MOE guidance). Compliance overhead can be non-trivial even for small outfits.\n\n### 5.3 Coding and small tooling\n\nOn the coding side, powerful model-based code assistants:\n\n- make you faster (good),\n- but also make many small tools easy to clone (bad for moat).\n\nIf you ship small Python-backed tools for maths/education:\n\n- the technical implementation becomes less of a moat;\n- your advantage becomes:\n  - insight into *what to build*,  \n  - UI/UX that matches local student needs,  \n  - and integration with your own teaching systems.\n\nAgain: *ideas and distribution* become the scarce resources, not \u201cintelligence\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Strategic constraints you should assume\n\nIf I had to condense it into \u201cassumptions to build your life strategy around\u201d:\n\n1. **Marginal tokens get very cheap; frontier access remains gated.**  \n   - Plan on abundant mid-tier models, but do *not* rely on unrestricted access to the very strongest systems.\n\n2. **Compute and energy are still visibly scarce at your scale.**  \n   - Large, continuous agentic runs and huge context sweeps will have a real bill attached, whether API or local.\n\n3. **Integration and formalisation are the real bottlenecks.**  \n   - Turning \u201craw model power\u201d into a coherent, reproducible research pipeline for your topology/K-theory/etc. will cost lots of time and some money.\n\n4. **Human capital and taste are where you win.**  \n   - In maths: problem selection, judgement, and ability to smell nonsense.  \n   - In education: trust, pedagogy, and local understanding of students and parents.\n\n5. **Commoditisation is unavoidable; you must design around it.**  \n   - Assume that anything that can be done by \u201ca diligent honours student + a good model\u201d is not a long-term moat for you.\n\n---\n\n## 7. What you can start doing now to mitigate future hurdles\n\nConcrete moves that future-you will be grateful for:\n\n1. **Build your research in open, AI-friendly formats.**  \n   - Clean LaTeX (consistent macros, labels).  \n   - Version control everything (Git).  \n   - Consider gradually mirroring key arguments in a proof assistant ecosystem.\n\n2. **Design a model-agnostic interface for your workflows.**  \n   - Use your own thin API layer so you can swap providers without rewriting your entire system.\n   - Keep local embeddings and knowledge stores under your control.\n\n3. **Deliberately practice \u201cAI-critique\u201d rather than \u201cAI-obedience.\u201d**  \n   - Use models as idea generators and proof sketchers, but train yourself to *attack* their output regularly.\n   - Treat them as clever but unreliable co-authors.\n\n4. **In your business, lean into the human-only bits.**  \n   - Parent communication, student motivation, exam strategy, crisis management.  \n   - Let AI handle the drudge; make sure *you* are the part that\u2019s hardest to replace.\n\n5. **Keep optionality in hardware.**  \n   - Don\u2019t rush to build a mini datacentre, but do keep an eye on \u201csweet spot\u201d hardware (one or two good GPUs) that let you run strong open models if API terms become annoying.\n\n---\n\nIn short: for someone like you, the future pain points are less about \u201ccan I afford intelligence?\u201d and more about:\n\n- **can I access the *best* intelligence?**  \n- **can I tame it into robust workflows?**  \n- **can I stay non-generic in a world where everyone has smart tools?**\n\nIf you want, we can sketch an explicit 5\u201310 year \u201cresearch + business\u201d plan assuming a couple of plausible AI cost/access trajectories and see how your choices (hardware vs API, formalisation, business positioning) change under each."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":12672,"end_idx":12672,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"4f58e5c6-cb39-42d5-9828-a69266e352cd","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"06967621-8afb-4df7-a135-2d6f5723261c","turn_exchange_id":"9f2a9611-b1a8-4acd-8eb1-c79a78275609"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"06967621-8afb-4df7-a135-2d6f5723261c","children":["a21d57b1-9b18-4f51-93ec-0abef9728f4e"]},"a21d57b1-9b18-4f51-93ec-0abef9728f4e":{"id":"a21d57b1-9b18-4f51-93ec-0abef9728f4e","message":{"id":"a21d57b1-9b18-4f51-93ec-0abef9728f4e","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764904363.813,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["As an individual or small team researcher, ChatGPT Pro, Gemini Ultra and similar models may be the most advanced reasoning models I can access.

A manual workflow you can start using in the UI\n\nThis is the lowest-friction version \u2013 just you + ChatGPT (and optionally Gemini) in the browser.\n\n### 2.1 Create a \u201cresearch ticket\u201d for each problem\n\nIn a separate document (Markdown, LaTeX, or even a text file) track:\n\n- **Problem**: precise statement, including hypotheses.  \n- **Context**: where it comes from, relevant known results, notation.  \n- **Current plan**: 3\u201310 bullet points max.  \n- **Subgoals**: lemmas you think might be true.  \n- **Dead ends**: things already tried and why they failed.  \n- **Open questions**: things you don\u2019t know yet.\n\nThis is your persistent state. You paste only the relevant slice into the model at each step.\n\n### 2.2 Force the model into phases\n\nInstead of \u201cHere\u2019s the problem, solve it\u201d, you do a sequence like:\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Understanding and decomposition**\n\nPrompt:\n\n> You are assisting with long-horizon mathematical research.  \n> For this turn:\n> - Restate the problem precisely.\n> - Identify and name at most 5 key subproblems or conjectural lemmas.\n> - For each subproblem, give a 2\u20133 sentence sketch of the most promising attack.\n> - Do **not** attempt full proofs or computations yet.  \n> \n> Only output:  \n> 1. \u201cRestatement\u201d  \n> 2. \u201cSubproblems\u201d list  \n> 3. \u201cAttack sketches\u201d.  \n\nIf it starts proving things anyway: you just ignore the proofs and extract the decomposition.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Pick a line of attack**\n\nYou decide which subproblem looks most fruitful and ask:\n\n> Focus only on Subproblem 2 (as defined above).  \n> For this turn:\n> - Propose a 3\u20136 step proof or disproof strategy as a numbered list.  \n> - For each step, state the *claim* and the main tools you expect to use.  \n> - Do **not** fill in detailed proofs yet.  \n\nYou update your research ticket\u2019s \u201cCurrent plan\u201d from this output.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Localised proof attempt**\n\nNow zoom in on a single step of that plan, e.g. step 1:\n\n> Now work only on Step 1 of the plan above.  \n> - State clearly the lemma you are trying to prove.  \n> - Give a detailed proof attempt.  \n> - At the end, list explicitly any gaps, unproven claims, or cases you are unsure about.\n\nYou are telling the model: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect; you\u2019re allowed to leave gaps.\u201d That is the opposite of the one-shot \u201cproduce a polished solution\u201d vibe.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Self-critique**\n\nNow you *re-feed* the proof attempt (or the key parts) and ask:\n\n> Critique the proof above.  \n> - Look for incorrect inferences, hidden assumptions, non-trivial steps glossed over, and missing cases.  \n> - Try to construct explicit counterexamples where appropriate.  \n> - Rate your confidence in the correctness of the proof on a 0\u2013100 scale and justify the rating in 3\u20135 bullet points.  \n> \n> Do **not** propose a new proof yet; only critique and possible counterexamples.\n\nYou can do this in a separate chat (fresh model instance) if you want the critic to be less biased by its own earlier output.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Iterate**\n\nDepending on the critique:\n\n- If serious errors appear, you revise the plan or subproblem formulation.  \n- If the proof looks salvageable, you ask for a revised proof that explicitly addresses each critique point.\n\nYou log that in your research ticket and move on to the next subproblem.\n\nThis already breaks the \u201csingle shot\u201d pattern: every serious lemma goes through at least:\n\n1. Plan  \n2. Attempt  \n3. Critique  \n4. Refinement or abandonment.\n\nYou can bring Gemini Ultra into the loop by giving *it* the proof and asking for an independent critique; see \u00a74.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Programmatic multi-agent workflow (Python level)\n\nOnce you are comfortable with the manual version, you can script it. Conceptually you need three roles:\n\n1. **Planner agent** \u2013 decomposes problems, proposes subgoals and proof plans.  \n2. **Prover agent** \u2013 fills in details for a chosen subgoal.  \n3. **Critic agent** \u2013 tries to break the prover\u2019s output.\n\nAll three roles can actually be the *same* underlying model (e.g. ChatGPT) with different prompts, or mixtures: ChatGPT as prover, Gemini as critic, etc.\n\n### 3.1 State representation\n\nUse a single JSON document to track the \u201cworld state\u201d:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"problem_id\": \"2025-12-05-topology-lemma-1\",\n  \"statement\": \"...\",\n  \"notes\": \"...(background, definitions)...\",\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\"id\": \"S1\", \"description\": \"...\", \"status\": \"open\"},\n    {\"id\": \"S2\", \"description\": \"...\", \"status\": \"open\"}\n  ],\n  \"attempts\": [\n    {\n      \"subproblem_id\": \"S1\",\n      \"attempt_id\": \"A1\",\n      \"plan\": \"...\",\n      \"proof_text\": \"...\",\n      \"critic_model\": \"gemini\",\n      \"critic_report\": \"...\",\n      \"critic_score\": 41,\n      \"status\": \"rejected\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nYour script:\n\n- Reads this file,\n- Decides what to ask next,\n- Calls the chosen model with the relevant context,\n- Parses the response,\n- Updates the file.\n\n### 3.2 Example loop (high level)\n\nPseudocode (language-agnostic):\n\n```text\nwhile not done:\n    # 1. If no subproblems, ask planner to propose them\n    if no_open_subproblems(state):\n        state = call_planner_agent(state)\n\n    # 2. Select an open subproblem\n    sp = choose_subproblem(state)\n\n    # 3. Ask planner for a short plan for this subproblem\n    plan = call_planner_for_plan(sp, state)\n\n    # 4. Ask prover to fill in one step of the plan\n    proof_attempt = call_prover_for_step(sp, plan, state)\n\n    # 5. Ask critic (maybe a different model) to evaluate\n    critique = call_critic(proof_attempt, sp, state)\n\n    # 6. Use critic score to decide\n    if critique.score < 50:\n        mark_attempt_rejected(state, sp, critique)\n        maybe_update_subproblem_or_plan(state, sp, critique)\n    else:\n        mark_attempt_provisionally_accepted(state, sp, critique)\n\n    # 7. Occasionally ask a model (or yourself) for a global summary\n    if iterations % 10 == 0:\n        state = call_summariser_agent(state)\n        save_state(state)\n```\n\nYou can implement this with a lightweight orchestrator (e.g. LangGraph) or just hand-roll it in Python with the OpenAI API and Google\u2019s generative AI API.\n\nThe important bit: the **controller** (your script) *never asks for a final solution in one step*. It only asks for:\n\n- decomposition,\n- local attempts,\n- local critiques,\n- and periodic summaries.\n\nYou get a tree of explored attempts over time.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Making multiple models reinforce / attack each other\n\nGiven you likely have:\n\n- ChatGPT Pro (frontier OpenAI models),\n- Gemini Ultra (Google\u2019s top model),\n- maybe one or two strong open models via an API,\n\nuse them asymmetrically:\n\n### 4.1 Default roles that play to strengths\n\nA simple, robust pattern:\n\n- **ChatGPT as synthesiser**:  \n  \u2013 main planner and prover; good at structured reasoning and math exposition.\n\n- **Gemini as adversarial critic**:  \n  \u2013 feed it only:\n    - the problem,\n    - the candidate proof,\n    - and a prompt like:\n      > Your goal is to find flaws in this argument, not to be polite.  \n      > Treat this as a hostile review. Seek errors, gaps, unjustified steps, missing cases.\n\n- **Open-source / local model as brute-force assistant** (if you have one):  \n  \u2013 enumerate examples, special cases, sanity checks:\n    - search over small graphs, matrices, functions, etc.;\n    - feed counterexamples back into the main loop.\n\n### 4.2 Cross-checking\n\nFor any serious intermediate result:\n\n1. Ask model A (ChatGPT) for a proof.  \n2. Ask model B (Gemini) to:\n   - restate the lemma in its own words,\n   - re-prove it from scratch *without seeing model A\u2019s proof*,\n   - then compare the two arguments and highlight discrepancies.\n\nIf they disagree structurally, that\u2019s a red flag; you treat that lemma as not yet secured.\n\n### 4.3 Cheap ensemble for \u201cdon\u2019t rush the final answer\u201d\n\nYou can also weaponise disagreement against premature final answers:\n\n- Have a \u201cchecker\u201d agent whose only job is to read the current state and say:\n  - whether we\u2019ve used all subproblems,\n  - whether any open subgoal remains unaddressed,\n  - whether the argument\u2019s structure is coherent.\n\nYou only permit yourself to synthesise a \u201ccandidate final solution\u201d when this checker (maybe another ChatGPT instance) gives you a high confidence score and explicitly lists all subgoals as addressed.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Preventing \u201cone-shot solution mode\u201d in practice\n\nThree practical tricks:\n\n### 5.1 Hard role separation in prompts\n\nNever ask:\n\n> \u201cHere is a hard problem. Think step by step and give me a solution.\u201d\n\nInstead, hard-code the phase:\n\n- \u201cIn this turn, you are only allowed to propose subproblems.\u201d\n- \u201cIn this turn, you may *only* critique existing reasoning.\u201d\n- \u201cIn this turn, you must *not* introduce any new lemmas; just check this one carefully.\u201d\n\nIf you code this, the controller can even automatically reject outputs that contain phrases like \u201cFinal answer:\u201d or \u201cTherefore we\u2019re done\u201d in the wrong phase.\n\n### 5.2 Use explicit \u201cstop conditions\u201d\n\nDecide *ahead of time* for a given problem:\n\n- \u201cI will not accept any \u2018final solution\u2019 until:\n  - at least 2 distinct proof strategies have been tried and documented, and\n  - at least 1 critic run has passed with high confidence.\u201d\n\nThis is not about the model; it is about **binding yourself** to a more cautious process.\n\n### 5.3 Develop your own \u201cprotocol language\u201d\n\nYou can define a tiny protocol for messages between your controller and the model, e.g.:\n\n- `MODE:PLAN` \u2013 decomposition only.  \n- `MODE:PROVE_STEP` \u2013 prove labelled lemma L_k.  \n- `MODE:CRITIQUE` \u2013 attack this proof.  \n- `MODE:SUMMARISE` \u2013 global summary.\n\nThen you always embed a header like:\n\n> MODE:CRITIQUE  \n> TASK: See below\u2026\n\nin the prompt, and the model learns the pattern. It\u2019s crude, but in practice it helps.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Where this leaves you strategically\n\nGiven that true \u201chours-long monolithic thinking models\u201d are likely to remain institutional toys for a while, your edge as an individual or small team will come from:\n\n- **System design**, not raw model power.  \n  \u2013 A good orchestration of today\u2019s models can easily outperform naive one-shot use of tomorrow\u2019s.\n\n- **Taste and judgement**.  \n  \u2013 Knowing *which* subproblems to pursue, when to abandon them, and when to distrust a slick-looking proof.\n\n- **Tooling discipline**.  \n  \u2013 Keeping your research ticket / JSON state clean, reproducible, and under version control, so you can resume a problem weeks later and see the whole \u201cthought tree\u201d.\n\nIf you want, next step we can:\n- sketch an actual Python script using the OpenAI and Google APIs, with concrete prompts for planner/prover/critic, and  \n- adapt it to one real problem of yours (e.g. a topology lemma) to see where it breaks and how to refine it."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":12233,"end_idx":12233,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"53ae0304-1ef9-4677-9b8a-12b831a0b965","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"de6d5652-5933-44f6-8f53-552c13347285","turn_exchange_id":"ec180898-818d-4b26-8e78-f99722c49096","branching_from_conversation_id":"6931cd0d-d89c-8323-bbae-aef21012b981","branching_from_conversation_title":"Intelligence too cheap analysis","branching_from_conversation_owner":"user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"de6d5652-5933-44f6-8f53-552c13347285","children":["17b485ff-9336-4cc9-85ef-e7625294f6e1"]},"17b485ff-9336-4cc9-85ef-e7625294f6e1":{"id":"17b485ff-9336-4cc9-85ef-e7625294f6e1","message":{"id":"17b485ff-9336-4cc9-85ef-e7625294f6e1","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764905659.866,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Let us do a more comprehensive sketch, with Python code included, of how this could be orchestrated with the help of Langraph.

High-level architecture\n\nWe\u2019ll build a **StateGraph** (LangGraph\u2019s main graph type) with these nodes:\n\n1. `decompose`: given a problem, propose a small set of subproblems and pick one.\n2. `plan`: outline a short proof plan for the current subproblem.\n3. `prove`: attempt a detailed proof attempt following the plan.\n4. `critique`: Gemini attacks the proof, returns a 0\u2013100 score + report.\n5. `summary`: if we\u2019re done (or exhausted attempts), summarise the best effort.\n\nControl flow:\n\n```text\nSTART\n  \u2193\ndecompose\n  \u2193\nplan\n  \u2193\nprove\n  \u2193\ncritique\n  \u251c\u2500 if (score < threshold AND attempts < max): \u2192 plan (loop)\n  \u2514\u2500 else \u2192 summary \u2192 END\n```\n\nYou get a **plan\u2013prove\u2013criticise loop** that can run multiple cycles but is bounded by both `max_attempts` and LangGraph\u2019s `recursion_limit`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. State schema\n\nWe\u2019ll use `TypedDict` for the shared graph state.\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nimport json\nimport os\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nfrom langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n```\n\n```python\nclass Subproblem(TypedDict, total=False):\n    id: str\n    description: str\n\n\nclass GraphState(TypedDict):\n    # Problem context\n    problem: str\n    context: str\n\n    # Decomposition\n    subproblems: List[Subproblem]\n    current_subproblem_id: Optional[str]\n\n    # Current iteration artefacts\n    current_plan: Optional[str]\n    current_proof: Optional[str]\n    current_critique: Optional[str]\n    critic_score: float        # 0\u2013100\n    attempt_count: int\n    max_attempts: int\n\n    # Final output\n    summary: Optional[str]\n\n    # Debug / trace log\n    log: List[str]\n```\n\nThis is intentionally minimal. You can extend it later with:\n\n- `attempt_history` (list of proofs / critiques),  \n- per-subproblem statuses,  \n- links into your LaTeX corpus, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Model clients (OpenAI + Gemini via LangChain)\n\n```python\n# OpenAI: planner + prover + summariser\nplanner_llm = ChatOpenAI(\n    model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",   # cheap-ish planner\n    temperature=0.2,\n)\n\nprover_llm = ChatOpenAI(\n    model=\"gpt-4.1\",        # stronger model for proofs\n    temperature=0.0,\n)\n\nsummariser_llm = ChatOpenAI(\n    model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\n    temperature=0.2,\n)\n\n# Gemini: adversarial critic\ncritic_llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(\n    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n    temperature=0.0,\n)\n```\n\nYou can swap model names as you like; the orchestration stays the same.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Node implementations\n\nEach node is a plain Python function that:\n\n- takes `state: GraphState` (and optionally `config: RunnableConfig` etc.),  \n- returns a *partial* state update: `dict[str, Any]`.\n\nLangGraph merges updates into the existing state.\n\n### 4.1 Decomposition node\n\nTakes the global problem, returns subproblems and picks one as current.\n\n```python\ndef decompose_node(\n    state: GraphState,\n    config: RunnableConfig | None = None,\n) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Decompose the main problem into subproblems and choose one.\"\"\"\n\n    if state[\"subproblems\"]:\n        # Already decomposed; do nothing\n        return {}\n\n    system_prompt = (\n        \"You are a mathematical research planner helping a human mathematician.\\n\"\n        \"Given a difficult problem, you suggest a small number (2\u20135) of subproblems \"\n        \"that would help solve or better understand the main problem.\\n\"\n        \"You MUST output pure JSON with the following structure:\\n\"\n        '{ \"subproblems\": [ { \"id\": \"S1\", \"description\": \"...\" }, ... ] }\\n'\n        \"No commentary, no markdown.\"\n    )\n\n    human_prompt = f\"\"\"Main problem:\n\n{state[\"problem\"]}\n\nContext (definitions, known results, notation):\n\n{state[\"context\"]}\n\nNow produce the JSON object as specified.\n\"\"\"\n\n    messages = [\n        SystemMessage(content=system_prompt),\n        HumanMessage(content=human_prompt),\n    ]\n    resp = planner_llm.invoke(messages)\n\n    try:\n        data = json.loads(resp.content)\n        subproblems = data.get(\"subproblems\", [])\n    except Exception:\n        # Fallback: treat whole response as a single subproblem\n        subproblems = [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"S1\",\n                \"description\": resp.content.strip(),\n            }\n        ]\n\n    if not subproblems:\n        subproblems = [{\"id\": \"S1\", \"description\": \"Trivial subproblem: restate the original problem.\"}]\n\n    current_id = subproblems[0][\"id\"]\n    log_entry = f\"Decomposed into {len(subproblems)} subproblems.

Wiring it together with LangGraph\n\nNow we build the graph: add nodes, then edges (including conditional routing from the critic).\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(GraphState)\n\n# Add nodes\nbuilder.add_node(\"decompose\", decompose_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"plan\", plan_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"prove\", prove_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"critique\", critique_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"summary\", summary_node)\n\n# Entry: START \u2192 decompose\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"decompose\")\n# Straight line: decompose \u2192 plan \u2192 prove \u2192 critique\nbuilder.add_edge(\"decompose\", \"plan\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"plan\", \"prove\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"prove\", \"critique\")\n# Summary terminates\nbuilder.add_edge(\"summary\", END)\n```\n\n### 5.1 Conditional routing after critique\n\nWe define a routing function that decides whether to loop back to `plan` or move to `summary`.\n\n```python\nCRITIC_ACCEPT_THRESHOLD = 70.0  # tune to taste\n\n\ndef critique_router(state: GraphState) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Decide where to go after critique.\"\"\"\n\n    # If score is low and we have attempts left, re-plan and try again\n    if (\n        state[\"critic_score\"] < CRITIC_ACCEPT_THRESHOLD\n        and state[\"attempt_count\"] < state[\"max_attempts\"]\n    ):\n        return \"replan\"\n\n    # Otherwise, accept best effort and summarise\n    return \"summarise\"\n\n\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"critique\",\n    critique_router,\n    {\n        \"replan\": \"plan\",\n        \"summarise\": \"summary\",\n    },\n)\n```\n\nCompile the graph:\n\n```python\napp = builder.compile()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Running the graph on a real problem\n\nExample driver script:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example: topology / analysis style problem\n    problem = r\"\"\"\nLet (X, d) be a complete metric space and let f : X \u2192 X be a contraction mapping\n(i.e. there exists 0 < c < 1 such that d(f(x), f(y)) \u2264 c d(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 X).\nShow that f has a unique fixed point.\n\"\"\"\n\n    context = r\"\"\"\nYou may assume the standard Banach fixed point theorem if you like,\nbut try to reconstruct it from first principles if possible.\nWork at the level of a graduate text in analysis.\n\"\"\"\n\n    initial_state: GraphState = {\n        \"problem\": problem,\n        \"context\": context,\n        \"subproblems\": [],\n        \"current_subproblem_id\": None,\n        \"current_plan\": None,\n        \"current_proof\": None,\n        \"current_critique\": None,\n        \"critic_score\": 0.0,\n        \"attempt_count\": 0,\n        \"max_attempts\": 3,     # don't let it loop forever\n        \"summary\": None,\n        \"log\": [],\n    }\n\n    # Important: limit recursion so the graph can't explode\n    result_state = app.invoke(\n        initial_state,\n        config={\"recursion_limit\": 20},   # LangGraph global step cap\n    )\n\n    print(\"\\n=== FINAL SUMMARY ===\\n\")\n    print(result_state[\"summary\"])\n    print(\"\\n=== TRACE LOG ===\")\n    for line in result_state[\"log\"]:\n        print(\"-\", line)\n```\n\nThis will:\n\n1. Decompose the fixed point theorem into subproblems.  \n2. Choose the first one; plan a proof.  \n3. Attempt proof.  \n4. Have Gemini critique it, score it, and either:\n   - send it back to `plan` for another loop (up to 3 attempts), or  \n   - accept and summarise.\n\nYou get a *bounded*, multi-turn reasoning process that never relies on a single \u201cone shot\u201d completion.\n\n---\n\n## 7. How to extend this for your actual research\n\nA few natural extensions you\u2019d likely want for serious work:\n\n1. **Multiple subproblems in one run.**  \n   - Add a `choose_subproblem` node that picks the next unsolved subproblem.  \n   - Track per-subproblem status (`open`/`solved`/`failed`) in `Subproblem`.  \n   - After `summary` for one subproblem, route back to `choose_subproblem` until all are done.\n\n2. **Formalisation hooks.**  \n   - Add a `formalise` node that turns a proof into Lean / Coq / Isabelle script, and a `check` node that parses fail logs.  \n   - Route `critique` \u2192 `formalise` \u2192 `check` \u2192 back to `plan` if the proof assistant complains.\n\n3. **Human-in-the-loop checkpoints.**  \n   - Use LangGraph\u2019s interrupt / resume primitives to pause after each `summary` or after high critic scores so you can manually inspect before continuing a branch.\n\n4. **Persistent research threads.**  \n   - Plug LangGraph into LangSmith or your own store so a given \u201cproblem id\u201d can be resumed days later with full state (subproblems, attempts, critiques).\n\n5. **Multiple critics.**  \n   - Add another critic node (e.g. OpenAI model with a different prompt) and route `critique` \u2192 both critics in parallel, then aggregate scores.\n\nThe core pattern doesn\u2019t change:\n\n- **State** holds your mathematical world.  \n- **Planner / Prover / Critic nodes** do small, well-scoped calls.  \n- **LangGraph edges** control when to loop and when to stop.\n\nIf you want, we can next customise this sketch for a *concrete* class of problems you care about (e.g. functional analysis, homotopy theory, \\(C^\\ast\\)-algebras), and build in domain-specific checks or tools."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":17333,"end_idx":17333,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"gettingstarted.ai","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gettingstarted.ai/langgraph-tutorial-with-example/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"LangGraph Tutorial with Practical Example","snippet":"14 Oct 2024 \u2014 LangGraph is a library built by the LangChain team that aims to help developers create graph-based single or multi-agent AI applications.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"gettingstarted.ai"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"medium.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://medium.com/%40varunkukade999/part-1-build-your-first-ai-agent-chatbot-with-langchain-and-langgraph-in-python-3b370bb6e7c1?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Part 1: Build your first AI agent + chatbot with Langchain ...","snippet":"In this article, we'll learn how to build a simple AI chatbot + agent using LangChain and LangGraph.

the critic is satisfied, or  \n  - a maximum number of attempts is reached.\n\nWe assume access to:\n\n- **OpenAI** models (e.g. `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`) via `langchain-openai`,\n- **Google Gemini** models (e.g. `gemini-2.0-flash`) via `langchain-google-genai`,\n- **LangGraph** as the controller/orchestrator.\n\n### Abbreviations\n\n- **LLM**: Large Language Model.  \n- **API**: Application Programming Interface.  \n- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, a simple structured text format.\n\n---\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\nWe define a shared state object, `GraphState`, and several nodes in a LangGraph `StateGraph`:\n\nNodes:\n\n1. `decompose`  \n   - Given the main problem and context, proposes several subproblems and chooses one as the current focus.\n2. `plan`  \n   - Outlines a short proof plan (3\u20138 steps) for the current subproblem.\n3. `prove`  \n   - Attempts a detailed proof for the current subproblem following the plan.\n4. `critique`  \n   - Uses Gemini to **attack** the proof, find flaws, and produce a numeric confidence score.\n5. `summary`  \n   - Summarises the current state, including proof and critique, for the human researcher.\n\nControl flow:\n\n```text\nSTART\n  \u2193\ndecompose\n  \u2193\nplan\n  \u2193\nprove\n  \u2193\ncritique\n  \u251c\u2500 if (score < threshold AND attempts < max_attempts): \u2192 plan (loop)\n  \u2514\u2500 else \u2192 summary \u2192 END\n```\n\nThis yields a **bounded** but multi-step reasoning process, avoiding \u201cone-shot\u201d answers.\n\n---\n\n## Environment and Dependencies\n\nTarget: Python \u2265 3.10.\n\n### Install dependencies\n\n```bash\npip install -U \\\n  langgraph \\\n  langchain \\\n  langchain-openai \\\n  langchain-google-genai\n```\n\n### Environment variables\n\nSet your API keys (for example in your shell, `.env`, or system environment):\n\n```bash\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"sk-...\"        # OpenAI\nexport GOOGLE_API_KEY=\"AIza...\"       # Google Gemini\n```\n\nThe coding agent should ensure:\n\n- Proper handling of missing/invalid keys.\n- Optional `.env` loading (e.g. via `python-dotenv`) if desired.\n\n---\n\n## Core Python Script (Single-File Prototype)\n\n> **Task for coding agent:**  \n> Turn the following code into a working Python module or script (e.g. `math_langgraph.py`) that can be run from the command line.  \n> Provide:\n> - a minimal CLI interface (e.g. arguments for `--problem` and `--context`), and  \n> - clear error messages if dependencies or API keys are missing.\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nfrom langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n\n\n# =========================\n# 1.
