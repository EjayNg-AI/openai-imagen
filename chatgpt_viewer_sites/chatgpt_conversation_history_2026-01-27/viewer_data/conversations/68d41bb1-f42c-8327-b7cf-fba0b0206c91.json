As a result, he was awarded the Fields Medal, mathematics' highest honor, equivalent to the Nobel Prize. However, Perelman declined the award, expressing a desire to avoid being seen as a figurehead for the mathematics community. His groundbreaking work in topology is still under scrutiny, but no major flaws have been identified. He is also eligible for a $1 million prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute for proving the conjecture. Perelman's reluctance to step into the spotlight is further emphasized by his evasion of media attention and his reclusive lifestyle. Despite his absence, his contributions offer profound insights into the geometry of the universe.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1156259700.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.newyorker.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/08/28/manifold-destiny","title":"Manifold Destiny","snippet":"On June 20, 2006, Chinese mathematician Shing-Tung Yau presented a lecture in Beijing on the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, a complex topological problem, highlighting the proof completed by his students, Zhu and Cao. Russian mathematician Grigory Perelman, who was instrumental in addressing key aspects of the conjecture through a most unorthodox yet highly regarded proof posted online in 2002, had already garnered significant attention in the mathematics community. Yau attributed primary credit to his collaborator Richard Hamilton and only partially acknowledged Perelman. Despite Perelman's groundbreaking work, he later turned down the prestigious Fields Medal due to ethical concerns within the mathematics community. A methodological dispute erupted, with Yau claiming substantial credit for Zhu and Cao\u2019s work. Perelman expressed discontent with the field's integrity, opting for professional isolation. His actions highlighted the tensions and dynamics in recognizing groundbreaking mathematical achievements.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1156737600.0,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68d41be4c6c08321a4ad9dc30340b441","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Organizing Millennium Prize Problem Statements and Citations","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9843a4b6f89c823d-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"087346fa-0aff-4587-8ed8-0349c1f1f7f4","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"087346fa-0aff-4587-8ed8-0349c1f1f7f4","children":["773b3002-7183-45a5-9a70-91f8ee76791e"]},"773b3002-7183-45a5-9a70-91f8ee76791e":{"id":"773b3002-7183-45a5-9a70-91f8ee76791e","message":{"id":"773b3002-7183-45a5-9a70-91f8ee76791e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758731376.57578,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Citing relevant sources","content":"For the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, I\u2019ll use the CMI page that confirms Perelman declined the prize, since it\u2019s more direct than secondary sources.

In addition, short-distance behavior must match perturbative asymptotic-freedom predictions (e.g., local OPE structure, stress tensor). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\nThis is the **official** formulation (Jaffe\u2013Witten note for CMI). It also notes that a mass gap implies exponential clustering of correlations. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\n# 2) What a **successful resolution** must establish (mathematical deliverables)\n\nA complete solution can be given in **either** of two equivalent languages:\n\n## (A) Euclidean (OS) route \u2192 reconstruction\nConstruct, on (finite-volume) Euclidean \\(\\mathbb{T}^4\\) and then in the infinite-volume \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) limit, a probability measure on gauge-equivalence classes of connections that yields **Schwinger functions** (Euclidean correlators) of the gauge-invariant local fields and proves they satisfy the **OS axioms** (temperedness, Euclidean covariance, symmetry, **reflection positivity**, clustering). By the **Osterwalder\u2013Schrader reconstruction theorem**, these produce a Wightman QFT on Minkowski space. Then show the spectral statement \u201cmass gap \\(\\Delta>0\\)\u201d holds for the reconstructed Hamiltonian. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n## (B) Minkowski (Wightman) route \u2192 axioms directly\nConstruct a Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal H\\) with a **unitary representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group**, a unique Poincar\u00e9-invariant vacuum \\(\\Omega\\), local **operator-valued distributions** for all gauge-invariant fields obeying **locality** and the **spectrum condition** (positive energy), and verify the **Wightman axioms**. Show **non-triviality** (not a free/Gaussian theory) and a **mass gap** (no spectrum in \\((0,\\Delta)\\)). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201\n\nIn **either** route, the solution must also:\n\n- **Match asymptotic freedom/OPE at short distances** (as encoded in the CMI brief). This means the Schwinger/Wightman functions must agree with perturbative renormalization-group predictions in the UV, including existence of the **stress\u2013energy tensor** and operator-product singularities with the right anomalous dimensions. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- Hold for **every** compact simple \\(G\\) (e.g., \\(\\mathrm{SU}(2),\\mathrm{SU}(3),\\ldots\\)), not just one special case. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- Establish the **mass gap** mathematically (equivalently: exponential decay of Euclidean 2-point functions of suitable fields; in the CMI note this is connected to clustering). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\n> **What does not suffice.** A constructive subsequence without proving OS/Wightman axioms, a \u201cweak existence by compactness\u201d without identifying the limit and its gap, or a lattice computation/numerical evidence for glueball masses. The CMI note explicitly excludes weak existence unless the axioms and the gap are also established. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\n### How this could be proved (plausible approaches the community considers \u201con path\u201d)\n- **Constructive RG from the lattice (Wilson action)**: prove reflection positivity, tight control of the continuum limit \\(a\\to 0\\) for gauge-invariant Schwinger functions, OS axioms, and a uniform (in volume) mass gap. This program has partial results (notably Balaban\u2019s control of flow in 4D small-field regimes), but it falls short of a full 4D construction with a proven, **uniform** gap. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- **Loop-equation/Wilson-loop methods**: in 4D, a rigorous solution to the Makeenko\u2013Migdal hierarchy is out of reach; in 2D YM, it is essentially solved and rigorously constructed, underscoring the dimensional barrier. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search7\ue201  \n- **Dualities/large-\\(N\\)**: heuristic guidance (e.g., potential string duals) but no rigorous 4D construction with gap. The CMI note explicitly frames this as aspirational. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\n# 3) Why it matters (links to QED and QCD)\n\n- **QED (Abelian \\(U(1)\\))**: Photons are **massless**; the theory has **no mass gap** (and significant infrared subtleties). The YM mass-gap problem highlights how **non-Abelian self-interaction** qualitatively changes the IR. A CMI-level proof would not make QED gapped (it isn\u2019t), but it would be a landmark in **rigorous QFT** showing that a 4D interacting gauge theory *can* be constructed beyond perturbation theory. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search8\ue201\n- **QCD (non-Abelian \\(\\mathrm{SU}(3)\\) with quarks)**: The **pure-glue** sector is precisely Yang\u2013Mills; a mass gap corresponds to **massive glueball excitations** and underlies **confinement** phenomena. Lattice QCD finds a discrete glueball spectrum and numerically a lightest scalar glueball \\(\\sim\\!1.6\\)\u2013\\(1.7\\) GeV in \\(\\mathrm{SU}(3)\\) Yang\u2013Mills, consistent with a gap\u2014but numerics are not a proof.

(See e.g. M\u00fcnster\u2019s convergent strong-coupling expansion for the gap; modern expository sources attribute the strong-coupling mass-gap/clustering to the Osterwalder\u2013Seiler program.) **This is not the continuum limit.** \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search6\ue201\n\n---\n\n# WP2 \u2014 Infinite-volume & OS axioms (strong coupling)\n\n**L2.1 Uniform exponential clustering (strong coupling)**  \n**Status:** **RIGOROUS (achieved) on the lattice** via cluster/Polymer expansions in the strong-coupling regime; bounds imply uniform decay and hence a (lattice) mass gap. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201\n\n**L2.2 Tightness & infinite-volume limits**  \n**Status:** **RIGOROUS (achieved) on the lattice at strong coupling.** Constructive QFT methods (cluster expansions) give existence of infinite-volume limits of Schwinger functions under standard hypotheses; Seiler\u2019s monograph is a canonical reference for this constructive machinery in lattice gauge theory. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search9\ue201\n\n**L2.3 OS axioms in infinite volume (lattice YM, strong coupling)**  \n**Status:** **RIGOROUS (achieved)** for the **lattice** Euclidean theory and its gauge-invariant correlators at strong coupling: Euclidean invariance, symmetry, RP, clustering all hold in the infinite-volume Gibbs state built by the expansion.

Indeed, even in Abelian cases we see phase transitions: e.g., **4D \\(U(1)\\)** exhibits a **non-confining phase at large \\(\\beta\\)** (Guth), showing singular structure does occur in related settings.
