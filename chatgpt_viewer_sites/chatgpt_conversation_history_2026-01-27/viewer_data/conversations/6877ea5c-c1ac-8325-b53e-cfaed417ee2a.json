David Blackmore introduced 100% wagyu cattle to the country in the early 1990s, establishing Blackmore Wagyu as a world-renowned brand served in elite restaurants across more than 15 countries. Notable supporters include chefs Neil Perry, Curtis Stone, and Thomas Keller. Ben Blackmore, now leading the business, emphasizes a specialization strategy over scale, maintaining meticulous care for their 4,000 cattle across 3,230 hectares. Their wagyu, derived from pure Japanese bloodlines, features superior marbling and flavor, justifying its premium price of $400\u2013$700/kg and lengthy four-year production cycle. Despite challenges like climate and high entry costs, Blackmore Wagyu\u2019s bespoke approach allows personal relations with clients and strong market resilience, even amid US tariff changes. Strategic moves like selling breeding cows while maintaining embryo production and diversified international demand ensure the brand\u2019s continued success and legacy in luxury beef production.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745951400.0,"attribution":"www.theaustralian.com.au"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagyu","title":"Wagyu","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1748530798.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_beef","title":"Kobe beef","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1741246290.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Michelin-starred_restaurants_in_Singapore","title":"List of Michelin-starred restaurants in Singapore","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1747420123.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsusaka_beef","title":"Matsusaka beef","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1734526157.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ito_Ranch","title":"Ito Ranch","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752053957.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiya_%28restaurant_chain%29","title":"Sukiya (restaurant chain)","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749836316.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6877ea5e858c8007bfaf63b23105d933","search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"conversation_composer_web_icon","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"96037062dde18217-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"bef6c949-d8fc-4233-90b8-839a53939d04","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bef6c949-d8fc-4233-90b8-839a53939d04","children":["6a390631-65fb-47b2-8d46-001b774868e8"]},"6a390631-65fb-47b2-8d46-001b774868e8":{"id":"6a390631-65fb-47b2-8d46-001b774868e8","message":{"id":"6a390631-65fb-47b2-8d46-001b774868e8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752689256.644827,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for a couple of seconds"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":2,"request_id":"96037062dde18217-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"17bd9a16-2928-4117-903d-cf93c78a2267","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"17bd9a16-2928-4117-903d-cf93c78a2267","children":["1a2f6255-6f48-4f0d-99a6-fd02b7a37266"]},"1a2f6255-6f48-4f0d-99a6-fd02b7a37266":{"id":"1a2f6255-6f48-4f0d-99a6-fd02b7a37266","message":{"id":"1a2f6255-6f48-4f0d-99a6-fd02b7a37266","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web","sonicberry_model_id":"current_sonicberry_paid","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1752689248.122909,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here are top spots in Singapore offering authentic Japanese wagyu, each known for premium quality cuts and traditional preparation:\n\n\ue200businesses_map\ue202{\"name\":\"Wagyu\u202fX\",\"location\":\"Club Street, Singapore\",\"description\":\"Premium Japanese steakhouse blending A5 Wagyu and Angus cross\u2011breed, exclusive platters\",\"cite\":\"turn0search0\"}\ue202{\"name\":\"Tajimaya\u202fYakiniku\",\"location\":\"Great World/VivoCity, Singapore\",\"description\":\"Charcoal\u2011grill yakiniku specialising in A5 Kagoshima & Australian Wagyu\",\"cite\":\"turn0search0\"}\ue202{\"name\":\"Wa\u2011En Wagyu Yakiniku\",\"location\":\"Jewel Changi Airport, Singapore\",\"description\":\"Premium Miyazaki A4/A5 wagyu in elegant yakiniku setting\",\"cite\":\"turn0search6\"}\ue202{\"name\":\"Aburiya Wagyu Yakiniku\",\"location\":\"Robertson Quay, Singapore\",\"description\":\"Pure Japanese Wagyu sourced directly from farms across Japan\",\"cite\":\"turn0search11\"}\ue202{\"name\":\"Ushidoki Wagyu Kaiseki\",\"location\":\"Tras Street, Singapore\",\"description\":\"Wagyu\u2011centric kaiseki (\u201ctongue\u2011to\u2011tail\u201d) multi\u2011course experience\",\"cite\":\"turn0search10\"}\ue202{\"name\":\"Bizen Okayama Wagyu Steakhouse\",\"location\":\"Plaza Singapura, Orchard Road, Singapore\",\"description\":\"Steakhouse focused on premium Okayama wagyu cuts\",\"cite\":\"turn0search4\"}\ue201\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 Highlights & Recommendations\n\n**Wagyu\u202fX** (Club Street)  \nCelebrated for its Hokkaido Wagyu \u00d7 Angus cross-breed, plus Kyoto A5 and other premium cuts served simply grilled.
