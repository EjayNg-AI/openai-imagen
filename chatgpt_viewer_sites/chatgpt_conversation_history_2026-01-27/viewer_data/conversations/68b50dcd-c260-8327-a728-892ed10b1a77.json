I\u2019ll assume near-flat spatial slices (\\(k\\approx0\\)) after inflation, as inflation rapidly drives \\(|\\Omega_k|\\to0\\).\n\n---\n\n## 1) Background: how \\(\\Lambda<0\\) changes the Friedmann dynamics\n\nWith scale factor \\(a(t)\\) and Hubble rate \\(H=\\dot a/a\\),\n\\[\nH^2 \\;=\\; \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\big(\\rho_r+\\rho_m+\\rho_\\text{vac}\\big) \\;=\\;\n\\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{r0}}{a^4}+\\frac{\\rho_{m0}}{a^3}\\right) + \\frac{\\Lambda}{3}.\n\\]\n\n- For \\(\\Lambda>0\\) (ours): at late times the \\(\\Lambda\\)-term dominates and the expansion **accelerates** toward de Sitter.\n- For \\(\\Lambda<0\\): the \\(\\Lambda\\)-term contributes **negatively** to \\(H^2\\). As radiation/matter dilute, a time comes when\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\rho_{m0}}{a^3}+\\frac{\\rho_{r0}}{a^4} + \\rho_\\Lambda \\;=\\; 0,\n  \\]\n  and \\(H=0\\). That is the **turnaround** (\\(a=a_{\\rm turn}\\)). Thereafter the universe **recollapses** to a Big Crunch in a **finite** proper time.\n\nIn the matter-dominated regime (\\(w=0\\), \\(k=0\\)), the scale factor admits a useful parametric form:\n\\[\na(\\theta) = a_{\\rm turn}\\,\\sin^{2/3}\\theta,\\qquad\nt(\\theta) = \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{\\theta}{\\sqrt{|\\Lambda|/3}},\\qquad 0<\\theta<\\pi.\n\\]\nHence\n\\[\nt_{\\rm turn}=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{3|\\Lambda|}},\\qquad\nT_{\\rm total}=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3|\\Lambda|}},\n\\]\n**independent of the matter density amplitude** (that only sets \\(a_{\\rm turn}\\)). It\u2019s a clean, robust difference from \\(\\Lambda>0\\).\n\n*Numerical feel:* If \\(|\\Lambda|\\) had the same magnitude as ours (but negative), define \\(H_\\Lambda\\equiv\\sqrt{|\\Lambda|/3}\\). Then\n\\[\nt_{\\rm turn}=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\,H_\\Lambda^{-1},\\quad T_{\\rm total}=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\,H_\\Lambda^{-1}.\n\\]\nTaking \\(H_\\Lambda^{-1}\\sim 16\\text{\u2013}17\\) Gyr, you\u2019d get turnaround at \\(\\sim 17\\) Gyr and a Big Crunch at \\(\\sim 35\\) Gyr after the Bang.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Early universe: can it look \u201cthe same\u201d?\n\n**Inflation.** Standard slow-roll inflation requires the inflaton potential \\(V(\\phi)\\) to be **positive and dominant** during inflation. A negative cosmological constant does **not** preclude this: you simply need \\(V(\\phi)\\gg |\\rho_\\Lambda|\\) while inflating, then (after reheating) the universe evolves with the true vacuum energy \\(\\rho_\\Lambda<0\\). So you can still have \\(\\gtrsim 60\\) e\u2011folds, nearly scale-invariant perturbations, causal smoothing, etc. The only model-building caveat is that the **minimum** of the post-inflationary potential sits at negative vacuum energy (an AdS minimum), so late-time recollapse is guaranteed.\n\n**Reheating & baryogenesis.** These are controlled by the inflaton coupling(s) and the expansion rate when the universe is radiation dominated. At \\(T\\gg \\mathrm{MeV}\\), \\(H^2\\sim 8\\pi G\\rho_r/3\\propto T^4\\) dwarfs \\(|\\Lambda|/3\\). Thus the reheat plasma, out-of-equilibrium decays/sphalerons for baryogenesis, and the QCD/electroweak phase transitions proceed essentially unchanged **provided** \\(|\\Lambda|\\ll H^2\\) at those epochs (a very weak requirement).\n\n**BBN & recombination.** Big Bang nucleosynthesis (\\(T\\sim\\mathrm{MeV}\\), \\(t\\sim1\\) s) and hydrogen recombination (\\(T\\sim0.3\\) eV, \\(t\\sim 380{,}000\\) yr) likewise occur when radiation/matter dominate. So the light-element abundances and CMB formation can look practically identical\u2014small \\(\\Lambda\\) corrections are negligible then.\n\n**Bottom line for the early universe:** if inflation sits high enough above the AdS minimum, the entire **primordial** history through CMB last scattering can look the same.\n\n---\n\n## 3) The **key differences** emerge after matter domination\n\n### (A) No late-time acceleration; guaranteed turnaround and crunch\n- Deceleration parameter \\(q=\\tfrac12\\Omega_m+\\Omega_r-\\Omega_\\Lambda\\). With \\(\\Omega_\\Lambda<0\\), \\(q\\) is **more positive** than in a pure matter universe: expansion slows faster.\n- There is a finite **maximum scale factor** \\(a_{\\rm turn}\\) given (for \\(k=0\\), ignoring radiation at late times) by\n  \\[\n  a_{\\rm turn}\\;\\simeq\\;\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{m0}}{|\\rho_\\Lambda|}\\right)^{1/3}.\n  \\]\n- The post-turnaround **contraction** phase blueshifts radiation and matter and ends in a Big Crunch at \\(T_{\\rm total}\\) above.\n\n### (B) Structure growth is **enhanced and earlier**, then reverses\n- With no late-time acceleration, the linear growth factor \\(D(a)\\) grows **more** than in our \\(\\Lambda>0\\) universe; potentials decay less, so structure forms **earlier/more efficiently**.\n- As \\(H\\to0\\) near turnaround, the \u201cHubble friction\u201d term in the growth equation weakens; bound structures form readily.\n- After turnaround, all super-horizon modes **re-enter**; contraction drives rapid non-linear growth. Expect a surge in mergers, starbursts, and black-hole coalescences heading into the Crunch.\n\n### (C) Galaxy/stellar astrophysics: shortened cosmic runway\n- **Low-mass stars** (which in our dS would burn for trillions of years) will never see those ages; the universe ends far earlier.\n- Star formation likely **peaks earlier** and then is truncated as the background heats in contraction; gas reservoirs are consumed and/or photoheated by the rising background.\n- Metal enrichment can be vigorous (many mergers and short dynamical times), but very **late** chemical evolution is cut off.\n\n### (D) Cosmic microwave background at late times\n- The **late-time ISW effect** flips sign: potentials deepen (no \\(\\Lambda>0\\) decay), so the ISW contribution that boosts large-angle CMB power in dS is **suppressed** (or negative) in AdS-\\(\\Lambda\\) cosmologies.\n- During contraction, the CMB temperature **rises** as \\(T_\\gamma\\propto a^{-1}\\). Near the Crunch, backgrounds become hot and opaque again.\n\n### (E) Horizons and causal structure\n- In \\(\\Lambda>0\\), event horizons are eternal; in \\(\\Lambda<0\\), the universe has a **finite future conformal time**, so there is still an **event horizon** of the \u201cdeadline\u201d type (signals beyond a finite comoving radius cannot reach you before the Crunch), but no asymptotic dS horizon or future null infinity.\n- There is **no future de Sitter no\u2011hair**: anisotropies/inhomogeneities are not redshifted away forever; they re-amplify during contraction. Approaching the Crunch, one expects Belinski\u2013Khalatnikov\u2013Lifshitz (BKL)\u2013type chaotic mixmaster behavior unless a smoothing mechanism intervenes.\n\n### (F) Black holes and gravitational thermodynamics\n- In global AdS with reflecting boundaries, even tiny perturbations can, over many reflections, concentrate and form black holes (weakly turbulent instability). A realistic FRW AdS-\\(\\Lambda\\) universe doesn\u2019t literally have that boundary, but **contraction** effectively \u201cconfines\u201d radiation/perturbations, pushing toward a black-hole\u2013dominated end state.\n- Expect an **increasing BH mass fraction** near the end; gravitational entropy is concentrated in BHs, not in empty space as in the far-future dS.\n\n### (G) Observational cosmology (if you lived there)\n- Distance\u2013redshift curves lack the late-time upturn from acceleration; SN Ia Hubble diagrams would favor strong **deceleration**.\n- Growth-rate measurements \\((f\\sigma_8)\\) would be **higher**, lensing power boosted at low \\(z\\).\n- Given \\(|\\Lambda|\\) is measurable locally (from background dynamics), the **expiration date is predictable** with modest cosmology: \\(t_{\\rm turn}=\\pi/\\sqrt{3|\\Lambda|}\\), \\(T_{\\rm total}=2\\pi/\\sqrt{3|\\Lambda|}\\) (modest corrections from radiation/curvature).\n\n---\n\n## 4) A concrete \u201csame-as-ours until late\u201d timeline\n\n1. **Inflation** on a positive plateau \\(V(\\phi)\\gg |\\rho_\\Lambda|\\): same smoothing, nearly Gaussian adiabatic perturbations.\n2. **Reheating** to a hot plasma; **baryogenesis** proceeds.\n3. **Radiation era \\(\\to\\) BBN \\(\\to\\) recombination**: essentially unchanged.\n4. **Matter era and structure formation:** slightly **faster** clustering than in dS; earlier halo collapse and star formation; no late-time acceleration.\n5. **Turnaround at \\(t_{\\rm turn}\\)**: comoving Hubble radius begins to **shrink**; bound structures abound; the background temperature and energy densities start to **rise** thereafter.\n6. **Contraction era:** increasing merger rate, accelerated non-linear collapse; CMB temperature ramps up; diffuse gas is heated and compressed; star formation eventually quenched as the background becomes too hot/ionized.\n7. **Approach to Crunch:** anisotropies grow; likely BH-dominated, high-entropy state; finally a **Big Crunch** singularity unless avoided by exotic physics (e.g., a bounce from modified gravity or NEC violation\u2014outside standard GR).\n\n---\n\n## 5) What **doesn\u2019t** change much (given the premise)\n\n- **Unification/decoupling of forces**, the **QCD** and **electroweak** transitions, and **quark\u2013hadron** chemistry are set by microphysics at temperatures where \\(|\\Lambda|\\) is negligible compared to \\(\\rho\\).\n- The **CMB acoustic peaks** and **light-element yields** can match ours to high precision.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Subtleties & model-building notes (the places to be critical)\n\n- **Inflation + AdS minimum.** Many potentials end in AdS vacua (common in stringy landscapes), but if the inflaton falls into an AdS minimum **too early** (or via a CDL bubble), the interior FRW region typically **crunches quickly**, not leaving time for galaxies. Your premise requires a model where inflation and reheating complete in a **metastable positive-energy region**, with the field later relaxing to the AdS minimum only after billions of years.\n- **Spatial curvature.** Inflation makes \\(k\\) tiny, but with \\(\\Lambda<0\\) even \\(|\\Omega_k|\\sim 10^{-4}\\) can slightly shift \\(a_{\\rm turn}\\) and late-time observables. The finite lifetime result remains.\n- **Entropy and arrow of time.** In dS, empty space dominates and Hawking\u2013Gibbons entropy/horizons frame the deep future. In AdS-\\(\\Lambda\\) FRW, the **arrow of time culminates** in a hot, high-curvature, BH-rich Crunch. There\u2019s no dS Poincar\u00e9-recursion story.\n- **Nonlinear AdS instability.** While not literally global AdS, the negative curvature scale \\(L=\\sqrt{3/|\\Lambda|}\\) defines a **natural \u201cbox\u201d scale**; as contraction proceeds, repeated gravitational focusing can mimic the confining features of AdS and speed up collapse of perturbations.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Executive comparison (dS vs AdS-\\(\\Lambda\\) FRW)\n\n- **Asymptotics:** dS \\(\\rightarrow\\) cold, empty, exponentially expanding; AdS-\\(\\Lambda\\) FRW \\(\\rightarrow\\) hot, finite-time **Crunch**.\n- **Structure growth:** suppressed at late times in dS; **enhanced** (then runaway) in AdS-\\(\\Lambda\\).\n- **Horizons:** eternal event horizon in dS; **deadline-type** event horizon (finite future conformal time) in AdS-\\(\\Lambda\\).\n- **Cosmic timescale:** dS has no end; AdS-\\(\\Lambda\\) has \\(T_{\\rm total}=2\\pi/\\sqrt{3|\\Lambda|}\\).\n- **CMB late-time signatures:** positive ISW (power boost) in dS; **suppressed/negative ISW** in AdS-\\(\\Lambda\\).\n\n---\n\n### Takeaway\nIf you **force** the early universe to look like ours, a negative cosmological constant leaves the **primordial** narrative almost untouched but completely rewrites the **fate**: stronger late-time clustering, a finite expansion maximum, and an inevitable, relatively prompt **Big Crunch** on a timescale set purely by \\(|\\Lambda|\\). The closer \\(|\\Lambda|\\) is to today\u2019s \\(\\rho_\\Lambda\\) (but negative), the more striking the differences already by \\(t\\sim 10\\)\u2013\\(20\\) Gyr; if \\(|\\Lambda|\\) is much smaller, the universe lasts longer, but it still ends in finite
