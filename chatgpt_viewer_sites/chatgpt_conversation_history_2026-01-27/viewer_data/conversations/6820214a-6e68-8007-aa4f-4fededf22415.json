You now need to use **token-based authentication** or **SSH** instead.\n\nHere are your two main options:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Recommended Fix 1: Use a Personal Access Token (HTTPS)**\nYou can continue to use the HTTPS remote, but instead of your GitHub password, use a [**Personal Access Token (PAT)**](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\n2. Click **\"Generate new token (classic)\"** or use the new **fine-grained tokens**.\n3. Give it a name (e.g., \"Git upload token\") and select scopes like:\n   - `repo` (for full control of private/public repositories)\n4. Generate the token and **copy it** (you won\u2019t be able to see it again).\n5. Then, in terminal, when prompted for:\n   - **Username:** your GitHub username\n   - **Password:** paste the token\n\n#### You can also do this ahead of time using:\n```bash\ngit push https://<USERNAME>@github.com/EjayNg-AI/corporate_website.git\n```\nThen it will prompt for the token.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Alternative Fix 2: Use SSH Instead of HTTPS**\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to deal with tokens frequently, set up **SSH authentication**.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Generate an SSH key (if you don\u2019t already have one):\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n```\n   - Accept the default location and **add a passphrase if you want**.\n\n2. Add the SSH key to the SSH agent:\n```bash\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\n3. Add your public key to GitHub:\n   - Run: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and copy the output\n   - Go to [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys), click **\"New SSH key\"**, and paste the key\n\n4. Change your repo's remote URL to SSH:\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:EjayNg-AI/corporate_website.git\n```\n\n5. Now push as usual:\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n---\n\nWould you prefer to proceed with **HTTPS + token** or **SSH-based authentication**?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"527c9573-ad80-461d-8de8-6478c9f24499","request_id":"93dec7b04ee38814-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"527c9573-ad80-461d-8de8-6478c9f24499","children":[]}}}
