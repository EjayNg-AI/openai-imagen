It is written for a typical Singapore HDB / landed-home consumer unit (a main Residual-Current Circuit Breaker - RCCB / ELCB plus several Miniature Circuit Breakers - MCBs). If your switchboard uses a different layout, adapt accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 1  Confirm **what** is tripping\n\n| Symptom | Likely Device | Meaning |\n|---------|---------------|---------|\n| **Whole house** loses power (all MCBs drop or stay up but there is no power) | **Main incoming breaker** (sometimes labelled \u201cMAIN\u201d or \u201cDB Incomer\u201d) | Severe fault or SP Group supply issues |\n| **Main RCCB / ELCB** drops but individual MCBs stay up | **Earth-leakage fault** \u2265 30 mA somewhere on ANY circuit |\n| A **single MCB** drops | **Over-current or short-circuit** on that circuit only |\n\nTake a photo of the consumer unit as-is immediately after the next trip so you know exactly which lever released.\n\n---\n\n## 2  Rule out an overloaded or shorted **branch circuit** (MCB trips)\n\n1. **Isolate that branch**  \n   - Leave the suspect MCB **OFF**.  \n   - Reset everything else. If supply now holds, the problem is inside that branch only.\n\n2. **Unplug all appliances** on that circuit (fans, chargers, lamps, router, etc.).  \n   Older phone chargers and plug-in LED lamps are notorious for internal shorts.\n\n3. **Inspect visible cabling & sockets** for scorch marks, heat, or a \u201cfishy\u201d smell (melting insulation).\n\n4. **Plug items back one-by-one**, waiting 30 \u2013 60 s each time.  \n   - The guilty appliance will trip the MCB almost instantly.  \n   - Replace or repair it; do **not** keep resetting.\n\n> **Tip**: Label plugs or use a plug-in breaker finder so you know which outlet is on which MCB for future faults.\n\n---\n\n## 3  Chase an **earth-leakage** fault (RCCB / ELCB trips)\n\nWhen the RCCB opens it means live\u2013earth or neutral\u2013earth leakage \u2265 30 mA on **any** circuit.\n\n### 3.1  Divide-and-conquer test\n\n1. **Turn off every MCB.**  \n   Reset the RCCB (it should now stay ON).\n\n2. **Turn MCBs on one at a time**, leaving 10\u201320 s between.  \n   - When the RCCB drops, the *last* MCB you turned on (or its load) introduced the leakage.\n\n3. **Narrow further**: unplug devices on that MCB one-by-one as in \u00a7 2.  \n   - Fans accumulate dust + humidity; the motor windings or speed controller can begin leaking after years of use.\n\n### 3.2  Hidden culprits to check\n\n| Possible cause | Why it leaks |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| **Water ingress** in ceiling lights / bathroom heaters | Condensation creates an earth path |\n| **Rodent-chewed cable** in parapet or false ceiling | Exposed copper contacts earth screen |\n| **Failing LED driver** or screw-in LED bulb | Switching power supply capacitors leak |\n| **Loose neutral or earth termination** inside socket | Arcing \u2192 carbon tracks \u2192 leakage |\n\nIf you cannot find the appliance, the wiring itself may be compromised\u2014time for a megohmmeter (insulation-resistance) test by a professional.\n\n---\n\n## 4  Environmental factors to verify\n\n| Check | Why it matters |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **Recent heavy rain / roof leak?** | Moisture in junction boxes causes earth leakage |\n| **Renovation drilling nearby?** | A nicked cable insulation worsens over days |\n| **Extension cords daisy-chained?** | Adds resistance \u2192 heat \u2192 conductor insulation failure |\n\n---\n\n## 5  Instrumented diagnostics (if you have the gear)\n\n1. **Clamp-meter with mA range on earth conductor** of suspect circuit \u2192 shows live leakage directly.  \n2. **Thermal camera** (even a smartphone add-on) scans sockets & MCCB tails for hot spots.  \n3. **Insulation-resistance tester** (\u201cmegger\u201d) at 500 VDC checks each circuit end-to-end; anything < 1 M\u03a9 is suspect.\n\nUnless you are experienced, treat these as *information gathering*\u2014the corrective work still needs a licensed electrician.\n\n---\n\n## 6  When to stop and call an electrician immediately\n\n- RCCB trips **immediately** even with every MCB OFF \u2192 possible faulty RCCB or upstream fault.\n- Burnt smell, scorch marks, or melted plastic.\n- Repeated trips within seconds of reset despite no load connected.\n- You are uncomfortable or unsure about any measurement\u2014electric shock risk is non-trivial.\n\n---\n\n## 7  Preventive moves after repair\n\n1. **Tighten all terminal screws** (torque driver) during annual inspection\u2014loose neutrals mimic leakage.  \n2. **Replace aging fans & LED drivers** proactively after ~8 years.  \n3. **Keep fittings dry**\u2014install IP-rated fixtures in bathrooms/outdoors.  \n4. **Label circuits clearly** inside the consumer unit lid for faster future isolation.  \n5. **Test the RCCB monthly** using its \u201cTEST\u201d button (SP Group and EMA recommend this).\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA systematic isolate-and-re-energise sequence will locate *most* tripping causes. Earth-leakage faults, especially intermittent ones, can hide in seemingly innocent devices like fans or in ageing cable insulation; resist the temptation to keep \u201cjust resetting\u201d because leakage currents that trip an RCCB are already in the shock-hazard range. If you cannot narrow it down to a single plug-in appliance quickly (within an hour), engage a licensed electrician\u2014they have insulation testers and can open the distribution board safely.\n\nStay safe, and don\u2019t hesitate to bring in professional help once the basics above are exhausted."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"bc62b067-178b-4d98-b6e0-ac6ee7ad8e6d","request_id":"942178521ff1f879-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"bc62b067-178b-4d98-b6e0-ac6ee7ad8e6d","children":["67dd12b2-888f-45e5-913f-aef9f7cb97d1"]},"67dd12b2-888f-45e5-913f-aef9f7cb97d1":{"id":"67dd12b2-888f-45e5-913f-aef9f7cb97d1","message":{"id":"67dd12b2-888f-45e5-913f-aef9f7cb97d1","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1747638036.591,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["it was caused by a 6 year old phone charger!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":["web"],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"9421b7e9ee26406e-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cbb3c783-f09b-4864-a514-55079cdffe0e","children":["d4a95bb3-1b30-4526-a20f-1fb686497f5a"]},"d4a95bb3-1b30-4526-a20f-1fb686497f5a":{"id":"d4a95bb3-1b30-4526-a20f-1fb686497f5a","message":{"id":"d4a95bb3-1b30-4526-a20f-1fb686497f5a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1747638050.446096,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[],"source_analysis_msg_id":"ffb44313-6270-44bb-b100-316876bfca9d"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"67dd12b2-888f-45e5-913f-aef9f7cb97d1","request_id":"9421b7e9ee26406e-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"67dd12b2-888f-45e5-913f-aef9f7cb97d1","children":["5097631b-e1d6-4f62-8a40-7ee15cd03cb2"]},"5097631b-e1d6-4f62-8a40-7ee15cd03cb2":{"id":"5097631b-e1d6-4f62-8a40-7ee15cd03cb2","message":{"id":"5097631b-e1d6-4f62-8a40-7ee15cd03cb2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1747638050.446368,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for 7 seconds"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":7,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"d4a95bb3-1b30-4526-a20f-1fb686497f5a","request_id":"9421b7e9ee26406e-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d4a95bb3-1b30-4526-a20f-1fb686497f5a","children":["28f9d48b-9954-4ed2-ab2f-adf2cb83e992"]},"28f9d48b-9954-4ed2-ab2f-adf2cb83e992":{"id":"28f9d48b-9954-4ed2-ab2f-adf2cb83e992","message":{"id":"28f9d48b-9954-4ed2-ab2f-adf2cb83e992","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1747638038.682619,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["That makes complete sense\u2014cheap-switch-mode phone chargers are one of the most common sources of earth-leakage and short-circuit faults once they\u2019ve aged a few years.\n\n---\n\n### Why that old charger tripped the breaker\n\n| Failure mode | What happens inside | How it shows up on your board |\n|--------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Input filter capacitors dry out** | ESR rises \u2192 heat \u2192 dielectric breakdown \u2192 live conductor touches shielding | RCCB trips (live-to-earth leakage) |\n| **Transformer insulation cracks** | Primary and secondary windings arc | RCCB or sometimes the branch MCB trips |\n| **Solder joints go \u201ccold\u201d** | High resistance \u2192 local hot-spot \u2192 carbon track to ground | Intermittent trips, sometimes a burnt smell |\n| **Plastic case fatigue** | Hairline fracture lets in moisture or lets pins flex against PCB | Random leakage, especially in humid weather |\n\nBecause the charger is double-insulated and sealed, you don\u2019t see the damage\u2014your RCCB did its job by cutting power as soon as leakage exceeded \u224830 mA.\n\n---\n\n### What to do next\n\n1. **Dispose safely**  \n   - Treat it as e-waste (most malls in Singapore have ALBA e-waste bins).  \n   - Do **not** put it back into service \u201cjust for low-power uses\u201d.\n\n2. **Check the socket**  \n   - Make sure the charger didn\u2019t scorch the outlet contacts;
