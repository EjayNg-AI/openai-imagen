Alamy\r\n\r\nA full audio version of this article can be found below the paywall.\r\n\r\nOn April 30th, 2023, as half a million people watched online, Russian grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi accidentally knocked over the captured black pieces lined up along his side of the board with a trembling hand, before reaching out to play the final move of his losing game. Three years ago, the complex interplay of the board would have meant nothing to me. Now, when Ding Liren\u2019s black bishop took Ian\u2019s pawn on f4, it looked to me like a rapier thrust deep into his opponent\u2019s heart and as the Chinese player covered his eyes to conceal his tears of relief, my own eyes were brimming.\r\n\r\nI would never have thought that I would enjoy chess. I assumed it was a slow-paced game for autistic savants with stratospheric IQs and people who excel at cryptic crosswords, sudoku, and logic problems and possess the cool-headed ability to plan campaigns of Byzantine complexity by visualizing the positions on the board 12 moves ahead. I studied English Literature. I dance and write poetry. I\u2019ve never had the patience for abstract puzzles of any kind and maths makes me weep with frustration. Yet now, I\u2019m hooked.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not alone in this. Over the past three years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people playing chess regularly, especially online. The boom began with Netflix\u2019s serialization of Walter Tevis\u2019s 1983 novel, The Queen\u2019s Gambit, in October 2020 (a show that was watched by 62 million households during its first 28 days, according to Netflix) and shows no signs of slowing down. It is unclear how many people in the world play chess (estimates range from 600 to 800 million), but we do have some proxy indicators. Subscriptions to the most popular chess YouTube chess channel, Gotham Chess, run by international master Levy Rozman, doubled over the course of 18 months in 2020\u201322 and then went from 2 to 3 million in only 90 days. Rozman\u2019s subscribers totaled 3.63 million as of April 2023. The channel, which is almost exclusively dedicated to the detailed analysis of chess games, hit one billion views in March 2023. Rozman\u2019s TikTok channel gained over a million subscribers from scratch within 30 days. Rozman is not the only popular chess creator: grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura has 1.94 million subscribers; sisters Alexandra and Andrea Botez have 1.29 million. YouTuber Lex Fridman\u2019s August 2022 interview with the world\u2019s highest ranked player, Magnus Carlsen, got 1.5 million views and his interview with Nakamura, Carlsen\u2019s long-time rival, has been viewed 1.2 million times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike most other popular sports, even more people are playing chess than watching it. Active users on the most popular online chess platform, chess.com, more than doubled in just over a year: from eight million in October 2020 to nearly 17 million in April 2022. On December 31st, 2022, there were seven million active members in a single day \u2014 a number that crashed the servers. The record was broken less than three weeks later: on January 20th, 2023, 10 million people were playing chess on the site. Chess.com is currently hosting more than a million games per hour and gaining new daily members at a rate three times that of the initial fervor during The Queen\u2019s Gambit\u2019s Netflix run.\r\n\r\nThe luscious and largely faithful serialization of Tevis\u2019s novel, with the mesmerizing Anya Taylor-Joy in the role of fictional chess prodigy Beth Harmon, undoubtedly helped to glamourize chess. The enforced leisure and isolation many experienced during the pandemic also increased the game\u2019s appeal. The influx of novice players quickly produced a virtuous circle: the game suddenly seemed more accessible. The activities of adult beginners and improvers are highlighted by Levy Rozman\u2019s \u201cGuess the Elo [official chess rating]\u201d and \u201cHow to Lose at Chess\u201d series, which poke good-natured fun at chess games sent in by low-rated subscribers in the spirit of recognizing that we\u2019ve all been there. We can also follow the fortunes of recent adult beginners through streamers like Tallulah Roberts (\u201cLula Robs\u201d), competitions like Pogchamps (inaugurated in 2020) and groups like Chess Punks. Those who, like me, were initially intimidated by chess\u2019s cerebral reputation quickly learn that you don\u2019t have to be a genius to play mediocre chess.\r\n\r\nThe 2022 chess cheating scandal also helped to keep chess in the public consciousness. Magnus Carlsen\u2019s accusation that Hans Niemann cheated in a chess match has led to a $100 million lawsuit (the suit is still ongoing; you can find a detailed legal analysis here). Elon Musk spiced up the gossip by speculating to his then 100 million Twitter followers that Hans Niemann had cheated using vibrating anal beads (a rumor that originated in a deliberately absurd erotic short story posted on the Reddit site r/chess).\r\n\r\nMany people have welcomed the growth of interest in chess because of the intellectual skills and personality traits that they believe chess fosters. There have been many claims that studying and playing chess will increase a person\u2019s general intelligence, improve executive functioning, concentration, and planning skills, and foster creativity.\r\n\r\nMany eminent people have claimed that playing chess helped them solve problems in other areas of life. This seems intuitive at first blush, especially, perhaps, in the realm of military strategy, since chess is itself a form of symbolic warfare. A plethora of famous military commanders from Norman the Conqueror, Tamerlane, Frederick the Great, and Napoleon to George Patton and Norman Schwarzkopf have also been avid chess players. Scientists from the Australian Defence Science and Technology Agency and the Swedish National Defence College have examined chess for the insights it might provide into military strategy by changing some of the rules to see which factors are most important to victory: e.g., what would happen if one player were given more pieces, while the other was compensated with the ability to move twice in a row?\r\n\r\nClearly, there is considerable overlap between the skills needed to play chess well and those required for other intellectual pursuits that involve strategic thinking and the ability to predict an opponent\u2019s likely actions. As a well-defined, concrete activity, with clear rules, in which improvements can be assigned an objective numerical value, chess provides a useful model for those who study cognition. Studying chess grandmasters helped Adriaan de Groot make early breakthroughs in cognitive science. Chess has frequently been described as the \u201cdrosophila\u201d of artificial intelligence: a model organism on which to experiment. Chess is an exceptionally rich source of analogies in general. \u201cThe chessboard is the world,\u201d commented Aldous Huxley. This makes it an extremely helpful explanatory tool. Those who have used chess as a metaphor to elucidate a more abstract, complex, rule-based system have included philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, physicist Richard Feynman and novelist Italo Calvino. But this does not prove that playing chess fosters transferable skills that will make it easier to master other domains.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s consider chunking: a concept pioneered by William Chase and Herbert Simon in 1973 that describes the way in which we group things into patterns to aid memorization (the exact nature of this concept is debated). Chess grandmasters are undoubtedly better able to recognize complex patterns on the board than novices. For example, where a beginner might simply see a number of individual pieces, including a white pawn threatening his black bishop on c5, a more experienced player will instantly recognize the board structure characteristic of the Evans gambit and will already know what Black\u2019s options are and how White is likely to respond to each of them. When we recognize the pattern, it is easier to memorise the position and respond appropriately: just as it\u2019s easier to remember a phrase in your native tongue than to memorise a string of individual phonemes in an unfamiliar language. Chess certainly utilizes this skill.\r\n\r\nLearning a choreographed dance form, such as jazz dance, also requires sophisticated pattern recognition of this kind, together with close attention, visualization skills, spatial awareness, and good short- and medium-term memory. When beginner dancers watch a sequence, they try to remember individual elements: running down a checklist of what the instructor is doing with her head, hands, feet, legs, hips, etc. Experienced dancers see an integrated whole, a movement pattern that they can often remember and copy after a single viewing. So, if you took a skilled jazz dancer and taught them the basic rules of chess, would they learn faster than anyone else (or vice versa)? As a professional dance teacher turned mediocre amateur chess player, color me skeptical.\r\n\r\nWe humans like to find quick fixes. Gaining domain-specific expertise is generally a time-consuming and cumbersome process. It would be convenient if there were some shortcut: if skills were fungible, so that those learned in one area could be easily applied to another: a phenomenon known as far transfer. Chess is often considered a good candidate for such an activity. Unfortunately, the evidence that chess\u2014or any other such activity\u2014could provide a master key of this kind is weak and anecdotal at best. There is a strong inverse correlation between good study design and meaningful positive results in this area, especially in education research (for evidence of this see here, here, and here). As an anonymous commentator on chess.com\u2019s bulletin board aptly puts it, \u201cchess teaches you to deep-think \u2026 during chess games! Real life is totally another \u2018game.\u2019\u201d The evidence strongly suggests that researchers Giovanni Sala and Fernand Gobet are correct: \u201cfar transfer remains a chimera\u201d and, in particular, \u201cThe \u2018Chess Effect\u2019 hypothesis is yet to be convincingly demonstrated.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany of the personal testimonies to the transferable benefits of chess come from people who, I suspect, are trying to justify their own compulsion. In his otherwise excellent history, The Immortal Game (2006), David Shenk twists himself in knots providing anecdotal evidence of far transfer. Benjamin Franklin, as Shenk relates, was an avid player and a voracious reader of instructional chess manuals and always carried a miniature chess set with him in the hopes of picking up an impromptu game. \u201cLife is a kind of Chess,\u201d Benjamin Franklin writes in his 1772 book, The Morals of Chess, which details what Franklin saw as the ethical and intellectual benefits of studying the game. Shenk accepts at face value Franklin\u2019s claim that he \u201crelied on it to continually sharpen his thinking and clarify his values,\u201d but it seems far more likely to me that this was a post hoc justification since, as Shenk also relates, chess \u201cscratched some kind of personal itch\u201d for the Founding Father. He simply \u201cseemed to need to play it.\u201d\r\n\r\nNot all chess players have felt as positive about the time they have spent on chess as Benjamin Franklin did. Without the comforting illusion that chess is indirectly benefiting other areas of one\u2019s life, the urge to play can feel like a destructive addiction. Michel de Montaigne wrote, \u201cI am ashamed to lay out as much thought and study upon that as would serve to much better uses.\u201d Far from viewing chess as an aid to intellectual creativity, for Albert Einstein, allegedly, \u201cChess holds its master in its own bonds, shackling the mind and brain so that the inner freedom of the very strongest must suffer.\u201d Marcel Duchamp, who abandoned a successful career as an artist and destroyed his marriage to Lydie Sarazin-Levassor to dedicate himself to the game full time, called himself \u201ca victim of chess.\u201d H. G. Wells described it as \u201cA nameless excrescence upon life,\u201d that \u201cannihilates a man.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd this addiction is not based on pure hedonistic pleasure. Unlike dancers, chess players rarely report experiencing a blissful state of Csikszentmihalyian flow: chess is simply too difficult for that. It demands a more painful kind of absorption that Garry Kasparov has described as \u201cmental torture.\u201d In addition, chess is, of course, a zero-sum game: \u201cI like the moment when I break a man\u2019s ego,\u201d grandmaster Bobby Fischer once commented in a post-match TV interview. Our human tendency towards loss aversion often makes such blows more painful than chess victories are joyful. For men, perhaps especially, the loss of status that losing a game implies\u2014a loss directly reflected in rating points\u2014is often agonizing, perhaps especially since chess is a perfect information game, a game involving very few elements of luck: when you lose, you have only your own incompetence to blame.\r\n\r\nComputers have outplayed humans since at least Deep Blue\u2019s narrow victory over Garry Kasparov in 1997. Deep Blue relied on brute force calculations (assessing over six million positions per second). The most powerful current chess AI, Stockfish, uses reinforcement learning (a trial-and-error system in which, like a human being, the system learns from its own mistakes). Stockfish has an ELO (official chess rating) of at least 3620; Magnus Carlsen\u2019s peak rating is 2882. Chess commentators use engines like Stockfish to analyze games in real time. As Sasha Chapin points out in his 2019 chess memoir All The Wrong Moves: \u201cduring a world championship match, the only people who don\u2019t know the best possible moves are the players themselves.\u201d Yet, despite this, we continue to value the human contest: Stockfish\u2019s superiority to us is as irrelevant as the fact that a car can drive faster than any professional athlete can run.\r\n\r\nDespite the negligible role played by fortune in their game, chess players resemble gamblers in that there is always the strong temptation to keep playing through a losing streak, to try to reverse one\u2019s luck in a state of frustration and recklessness that chess players call being \u201ctilted.\u201d Like an alcoholic drinking himself into stupor on whisky miniatures or a binge eater dipping back into the family-sized bag of Cheetos for just one more handful, to a player in this state each single game feels inconsequential. This is an especially easy trance to fall into, now that we can play five-minute blitz games against an opponent from anywhere in the world, at any time, for free, by simply clicking on a chess app on our phones. Unlike gamblers or alcoholics, we don\u2019t end up damaging our health or bank balances. We only lose the one thing that can never be recouped: our time. \u201cThe ability to play chess is the sign of a gentleman,\u201d states a famous adage often misattributed to legendary chess player Paul Morphy, \u201cThe ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite all this, I believe that there can be real benefits to playing chess, on both an individual and societal level. This partly depends on what activities chess is displacing. Schemes that offer chess lessons and online tournaments for the incarcerated seem likely to be beneficial, both to alleviate the boredom of prison and because the intensely competitive nature of chess provides a non-violent way of gaining status and respect. Some pilot programs introducing chess lessons and clubs into schools have had good results: most pupils involved report enjoying chess and that can in turn make them feel more enthusiastic about attending school in general (though any other pleasurable activity would probably have the same effect).\r\n\r\nBut are there benefits for the individual, too? Is it better to have spent two hours playing online chess than to have passed that time, equally unproductively, on social media? Perhaps I am just an addict trying to justify my behavior\u2014but I think there is a benefit to be had in time spent in thrall to the tiny, claustrophobic, artificial, black-and-white world of chess. I would rather be playing than scrolling my Twitter timeline glassy-eyed, not so much wanting to be online as wanting to want it: hunting for something to distract or entertain me. For many people, it is all too easy to browse social media at the same time as attempting to work or socialize. Doomscrolling produces a zombie-like state of sterile purposelessness: it\u2019s not compelling enough to fix your attention; it\u2019s just engaging enough to deflect it from other objects. Chess invites greater concentration. It is more akin to reading than to scrolling in that it invites you to focus exclusively on the game at hand.\r\n\r\nChess also provides a good way to stress-test your ideas\u2014even if these are only ideas about the game itself. In the world of discussion and debate, I find it surprisingly difficult to genuinely remain open to correcting my own erroneous views and changing my mind. My mind is a stubborn advocate for whichever side of the case I have chosen: dismantling opposing arguments and rejecting the other side\u2019s sources with ease. My own reasoning always sound persuasive to my ears. But I can\u2019t rationalize away the fact that my king is in check, that an enemy knight has forked my pieces, that the pawn I was relying on for defense is now pinned. In chess, if your opponent is competent, your moves are rewarded or punished depending on how good they are in themselves\u2014not how good you are at explaining them. It feels good to be measured up against something real.\r\n\r\nAnd, while I am skeptical that playing chess will improve your powers of concentration in general, chess is a game that rewards focus. Being good at chess is largely about noticing things. Even in the heightened arousal state of competition, you need to be able to survey the board, spot geometric relationships between pieces and tally up the threats and opportunities for both you and your opponent. This doesn\u2019t usually require specialist knowledge (beyond the basic rules) or expertise. It doesn\u2019t require genius. It simply calls for careful observation. That ability to see what is right in front of you, without allowing yourself to be biased by your own hopes, fears, or anxieties, is crucial in life, of course. But if I cannot do that in life, it feels satisfying to at least manage it in chess.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1972, just as the Cold War was gradually thawing, Russian Boris Spassky and American Bobby Fischer competed in the world chess championship. The excitement surrounding the match significantly boosted the popularity of chess, especially after Fischer won, breaking a 24-year streak of Russian victories. \u201cLike the game [of chess] itself, the Spassky-Fischer chess championship had no direct relevance to any real-world matter. And yet it seemed to stand for almost everything,\u201d writes Sasha Chapin. The current chess boom was not fueled by a conflict between superpowers, nor are any of the players involved as striking characters as Fischer, whose erratic behavior and volatile temper captured the public imagination.

Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky's Final Post Before His Death Addressed Taking a 'Break' from Content","snippet":"Chess Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky passed away unexpectedly, as announced by his family and the Charlotte Chess Center on October 20, 2025. Known for his roles as a commentator, educator, and content creator, Naroditsky was beloved within the chess community. He had nearly 500,000 YouTube subscribers and was a popular Twitch streamer. In his final video, released on October 17, he spoke about returning from a creative break and expressed excitement about future content.

Naroditsky, known affectionately as \"Danya,\" was a child prodigy who won the Under-12 world chess championship and became a grandmaster at 18. Throughout his career, he maintained a global top-200 ranking in traditional chess and was a top 25-ranked blitz chess player, recently winning the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August.\n\nBeyond competition, Naroditsky significantly impacted the chess community through his educational streaming on platforms like YouTube and Twitch, sharing insights and live commentary that drew thousands of viewers. A dedicated coach and educator, he taught aspiring players in Charlotte after earning a history degree from Stanford University. Tributes from fellow grandmasters, including Hikaru Nakamura and Benjamin Bok, highlight his unique blend of passion, talent, and dedication to promoting chess globally. Naroditsky was the son of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine and Azerbaijan and grew up in California.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1761019376.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.youtube.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M5E5-H_G18","title":"A KID for Danya! | Climbing the Rating Ladder vs. 1553","snippet":"In this continuation of the \"Climbing the Rating Ladder\" series I take on players of various ratings levels while pointing out typical ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.youtube.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT1F2nOxLHOfQI_hFiDnnWj4lb5KsviJ_","title":"End Game","snippet":"Introduction to Pawn Endgames | Principles of Chess Endgames | GM Naroditsky.

I\u2019ll argue that Italia\u2019s piece, without naming him, foresaw and articulated the precise virtues Naroditsky came to embody in the boom era of online chess\u2014so that, read today, it functions as a kind of anticipatory tribute.\n\n# 1) The essay\u2019s thesis aligns point-for-point with Naroditsky\u2019s public role  \nItalia\u2019s core claims are: (i) chess\u2019s \u201ctransfer of skills\u201d is often overstated; (ii) the game\u2019s real value is its intense, absorbing discipline inside a small, rule-bound world; (iii) the post-2020 boom was catalyzed by streaming platforms and charismatic educators; and (iv) despite engines, we still prize human struggle and narration. Each maps cleanly onto Naroditsky\u2019s legacy:\n\n- **Educator at the heart of the boom.** Italia highlights the adult-improver wave and the rise of creators who make the game accessible. Naroditsky was exactly this figure: a grandmaster-commentator-teacher whose YouTube/Twitch instructionals (speedruns, endgame series) became touchstones for players learning to \u201csee\u201d the board rather than memorize tricks. Multiple obituaries emphasize he was beloved precisely as an educator/streamer and head coach at the Charlotte Chess Center. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news39\ue202turn1news38\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n- **Pattern recognition (\u201cchunking\u201d) over genius-mythology.** Italia demythologizes chess as a realm for \u201cautistic savants,\u201d and reframes mastery as recognition of structures. Naroditsky\u2019s long-form endgame and speedrun playlists are explicit curricula on this point\u2014teaching adverse trade-offs, triangulation, opposition, \u201cking activity,\u201d prophylaxis\u2014i.e., the grammar of patterns. (See his \u201cPrinciples of Chess Endgames\u201d playlist; also the \u201cBeginner-to-Master\u201d speedrun.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search19\ue202turn1search23\ue201\n\n- **Human drama despite engines.** Italia stresses that engines\u2019 omniscience doesn\u2019t blunt the value of *human* struggle. Naroditsky\u2019s commentary was prized for narrating that struggle in real time\u2014why a human chose *this* plan under *these* constraints\u2014making \u201cengine lines\u201d legible as *decisions* rather than oracles. Tributes repeatedly cite his ability to make complex ideas accessible and to humanize elite play. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news38\ue202turn1news39\ue201\n\n- **A healthier refuge than doom-scrolling.** Italia frames chess as attention-training within constraints\u2014a better \u201ctime sink\u201d than social media because it demands presence. Naroditsky\u2019s channel is arguably Exhibit A: multi-hour analytical sessions that cultivate exactly the sustained focus Italia praises. Audience numbers and obits confirm how widely his format resonated. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news39\ue202turn1news38\ue201\n\n# 2) Specific passages that now read like an advance elegy for Danya\u2019s contribution  \n- **\u201cVirtuous circle\u201d of adult beginners and creators.** Italia\u2019s description of a self-reinforcing ecosystem of novice-friendly content presciently captures the niche Naroditsky made his own: episodic series that meet learners at *their* level, then scale up. (Examples: \u201cSpeedrun / Beginner-to-Master,\u201d \u201cClimbing the Rating Ladder,\u201d and a systematic endgame syllabus.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search19\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201\n\n- **Chess as an honesty machine.** Italia says chess \u201crewards noticing\u201d and punishes rationalization. Naroditsky\u2019s pedagogy constantly foregrounded *calculation hygiene* and *blunder-checking* under time pressure\u2014the art of noticing what refutes your plan. That\u2019s the practical soul of his lessons and commentary. (See the way his live-speedruns are teaching monologues about candidate moves and fail-safes.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue201\n\n- **Community-building beyond zero-sum.** Italia concedes chess is zero-sum, yet argues its institutions can be net-positive for society (schools, prisons, clubs). Naroditsky lived that paradox: elite competitor *and* builder of a local scene as GM-in-Residence/coach in Charlotte, a role repeatedly highlighted in remembrances and local press. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news39\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search8\ue201\n\n- **Engines vs. narration.** Italia observes that during world-class games the only people who *don\u2019t* know the best line are the players, yet we still show up for *them*. Naroditsky\u2019s commentary thrived exactly here\u2014translating engine verdicts into digestible human plans and instructive heuristics\u2014hence why so many tributes emphasize his commentary gifts. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news38\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n# 3) Where Italia\u2019s framing is *most* consonant with Danya\u2019s memory  \n- **The craft over the cult.** Italia pushes back on the \u201cchess makes you smarter\u201d narrative; Danya\u2019s brand was never quick-fix self-help. He taught *craft*: small advantages, endgames, time-management, damage-control\u2014habits that win real games and cultivate respect for truth over ego.\n\n- **Aesthetic intensity without toxicity.** Italia calls chess \u201ctiny, claustrophobic,\u201d yet meaningful. Danya modeled how to inhabit that intensity with empathy and clarity. The reaction from peers\u2014Hikaru Nakamura\u2019s on-stream grief and praise for Danya\u2019s \u201centhusiasm and love for the game\u201d\u2014speaks to a culture of care he helped normalize. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search14\ue201\n\n- **Teacher first, ratings second.** The obituaries emphasize his stature as a teacher/communicator at least as much as his ranking (top-200 classical; U.S. National Blitz champion in Aug 2025). That balance is precisely the kind of value hierarchy Italia celebrates. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news39\ue201\n\n# 4) What Italia missed\u2014and what Danya added  \nIn fairness, Italia focuses heavily on GothamChess, Hikaru, and the Botez channel, but (understandably for 2023) doesn\u2019t single out Naroditsky, whose growth and cultural prominence surged further afterward. What Danya added, uniquely, was **long-form, syllabus-quality instruction**\u2014hours-long endgame lectures and narrative speedruns with almost textbook structure\u2014which bridged the gap between entertainment and a *curriculum* that many improvers actually studied. That combination\u2014didactic depth plus live, humane commentary\u2014was his signature. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search19\ue201\n\n# 5) Conclusion: why this essay now reads like a time-spanning tribute  \nItalia argued that the *true* gift of chess in the 2020s wasn\u2019t generalized \u201cbrain training,\u201d but the cultivation of disciplined attention and honest engagement inside a bounded universe\u2014and that charismatic teachers would be the catalysts. Naroditsky *was* that catalyst for hundreds of thousands of learners and fans: a grandmaster who narrated the game\u2019s inner life in real time, built community, and left behind a body of teaching that will keep training eyes and minds for years.\n\nRead today\u2014alongside the obituaries and tributes\u2014the essay\u2019s portrait of what chess at its best gives to people precisely describes what Danya gave to chess. In that sense, Italia\u2019s piece functions as an unwitting homage: it names the values; Naroditsky supplied the exemplar. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news38\ue202turn1news39\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n---\n\n**Selected sources on Naroditsky\u2019s life and impact (for verification):** AP News obituary; Washington Post obituary; Chess.com tribute; US Chess; and reporting on community/peer tributes and his instructional catalog. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news39\ue202turn1news38\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search19\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news39\ue202turn1news38\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":1342,"end_idx":1385,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/755ccf6ebc0b6c69d1bd9fa5d8c81516?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://new.uschess.org/news/gm-daniel-naroditsky-1995-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2025/10/21/daniel-naroditsky-dies-chess-grandmaster/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/755ccf6ebc0b6c69d1bd9fa5d8c81516?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"American chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky dies at 29","url":"https://apnews.com/article/755ccf6ebc0b6c69d1bd9fa5d8c81516?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1761019376.0,"snippet":"Daniel Naroditsky, a prominent American chess grandmaster, has died at the age of 29.
