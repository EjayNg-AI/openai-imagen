Additionally, three major Singaporean banks completed interbank transactions using a live trial of Singapore dollar wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), with expanded trials involving tokenised MAS bills and CBDC settlements planned. MAS will publish a regulatory guide on tokenised capital market products and is aligning international standards for broader adoption. Singapore also announced partnerships with the Bank of England, Bank of Thailand, and Deutsche Bundesbank to facilitate secure, real-time foreign exchange and cross-border digital asset settlements.

Core change: SMS OTPs are being phased out in favour of **digital tokens**\n\n**Who\u2019s driving this?**  \nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS).\n\n**Key policy move (July 2024):**\n\n- MAS announced that banks must **strengthen resilience against phishing scams** by:\n  - **Phasing out SMS one-time passwords (OTPs) for login** to digital banking.\n  - Moving customers to **digital tokens** that live in the bank\u2019s app or in a passkey-style authenticator. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search22\ue201  \n- Rationale: SMS OTPs can be **phished or redirected**; app-based digital tokens are **device-bound and cryptographically tied** to the bank, making it much harder for scammers to hijack sessions.\n\n**What this means in practice:**\n\n- Over 2024\u20132025, login flows move from:\n  - *Username + password + SMS OTP*  \n  \u2192 to  \n  - *Bank app push / digital token challenge on your phone* (often with biometrics).\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the major banks are implementing digital tokens\n\n### DBS Bank\n\n- DBS has long pushed **\u201cDigital Token\u201d in the digibank app**, replacing most SMS OTP and physical token usage. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- Physical tokens for access to digital banking were already fully phased out from **1 April 2021**, with issuance stopped from February 2021. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search20\ue201  \n- You can only register **one device** as the digital token device at any time (a deliberate security design). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n\n**Implication for users:**  \nIf you\u2019re with DBS, you are *already* on the MAS/ABS \u201cfuture\u201d \u2013 the digital token on your phone is the default and has been for a while.\n\n---\n\n### OCBC Bank\n\n- OCBC rolled out **OCBC OneToken** (digital token inside its app) as early as 2019 to replace hardware tokens and SMS OTP in many flows. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search23\ue201  \n- After the 2021\u201322 scam wave, OCBC backed off a full phase-out and **continued offering hardware tokens** as an option, explicitly saying they were *not* ending them. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search27\ue201  \n- Latest notice: From **31 July 2025**, adding OCBC cards to Apple Wallet / Samsung Wallet will require **OCBC OneToken** instead of SMS OTP \u2013 again, moving flows off SMS. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n\n**Implication for users:**  \n- For most flows, especially card tokenisation and online usage, OCBC wants you on **OneToken**.  \n- Hardware tokens remain available (especially for customers who don\u2019t want or can\u2019t use smartphones), but are no longer the strategic default.\n\n---\n\n### UOB, Maybank, and others\n\n- UOB has taken a similar route (app-based tokens + reduced reliance on SMS OTP; details are broadly aligned with MAS guidance).  \n- Maybank Singapore uses **Secure2u Digital Token** on its mobile app to authorise login and selected transactions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search26\ue201  \n\n**Big picture:**  \nAcross the board, digital tokens in mobile apps are the **primary authentication method**; SMS OTP is being retired; hardware tokens sit as a **fallback or special-case tool**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. \u201cBringing back\u201d *physical* tokens: MAS\u2019 FIDO hardware token pilot\n\nThe phrase you\u2019re hearing about \u201cbringing tokens back\u201d actually refers to **new-generation hardware tokens** being piloted, not a rollback of app-based digital tokens.\n\n- Recent reports (Straits Times, Business Times, Vulcan Post, Fintech News SG) say MAS is:\n  - Working with banks on a **Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)** hardware token.\n  - The device looks like a **small USB stick or Bluetooth key** that you plug into or pair with your device.\n  - It will be used to **approve high-value online banking transfers**, where risk is highest. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n\n**Key points:**\n\n- This is **not** a return to old-style \u201ccalculator\u201d tokens for every login.  \n- It is designed as an **extra hardware factor** for *high-risk* transactions, while normal day-to-day banking stays on **digital tokens in the app**.  \n- MAS is pitching this as a **world-first nationwide rollout** of FIDO-class hardware for retail banking, driven by phishing losses and the need for something that scammers cannot replicate over a fake website.\n\n**Implication for users (if/when it rolls out):**\n\n- You\u2019ll likely:\n  - **Log in** with your app-based digital token / passkey.\n  - Use your **phone digital token** for everyday transfers.\n  - Plug in or tap a **FIDO hardware key** only when doing large / sensitive transfers (e.g. big bank-to-bank transfers, new high-value payees).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Wider \u201cdigital token\u201d regulation: DTSP regime (more about crypto/asset tokens)\n\nSeparately from banking login, MAS is also tightening regulation around **Digital Token Service Providers (DTSPs)** \u2013 this is about *crypto and tokenised assets*, not your internet banking token:\n\n- MAS issued a response to feedback on its DTSP consultation in **May 2025**, then clarified the DTSP regulatory regime on **6 June 2025**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n- Under the **Financial Services and Markets Act 2022**, the full regulatory framework for DTSPs comes into force on **30 June 2025**, with requirements on licensing, AML/CFT (anti-money-laundering / countering financing of terrorism), cyber risk, and conduct standards. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search21\ue202turn0search25\ue201  \n\nThis is *adjacent* to your question, but worth noting: MAS is clearly moving to **tightly supervise** any entity dealing in digital tokens in the broad sense (crypto, tokenised assets, etc.), while also hardening the **retail banking authentication stack**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. What this means for you over the next 12\u201324 months\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. **Expect SMS OTPs to disappear** for logins and many actions.  \n   - You\u2019ll log in via **digital tokens in your bank\u2019s app** (often biometrics + in-app confirmation), not via SMS codes.\n\n2. **Your phone becomes your primary security device.**  \n   - Losing or changing phones will mean **re-enrolling** your digital token, sometimes via mail-code or branch visit.\n\n3. **Physical hardware tokens will re-appear \u2013 but in a more targeted role.**  \n   - Not for everyday use, but for **high-value / high-risk transactions**, likely based on FIDO standards.\n\n4. **Regulation is shifting from \u201csoft guidelines\u201d to hard regimes.**  \n   - For both **asset-backed digital tokens** (stablecoins, tokenised bills) and **bank authentication**, MAS is moving to a strongly opinionated, prescriptive stance.\n\nIf you tell me which bank(s) you use, I can break down **exactly** what your login and transaction flows will look like and what you should switch on *now* versus what to wait for.\n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Further reading on MAS\u2019 digital-token strategy\ue202turn0news38\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search22\ue201","start_idx":661,"end_idx":708,"safe_urls":["https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/banks-phase-out-otps-login-phishing-scams-digital-tokens-4466786","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/banks-phase-out-otps-login-phishing-scams-digital-tokens-4466786?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.corbado.com/blog/singapore-passkeys-banks","https://www.corbado.com/blog/singapore-passkeys-banks?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/banks-in-singapore-to-strengthen-resilience-against-phishing-scams","https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/banks-in-singapore-to-strengthen-resilience-against-phishing-scams?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Monetary Authority of Singapore](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/banks-in-singapore-to-strengthen-resilience-against-phishing-scams?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Banks in Singapore to Strengthen Resilience Against ...","url":"https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/banks-in-singapore-to-strengthen-resilience-against-phishing-scams?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"9 Jul 2024 \u2014 The digital token will authenticate customers' login without the need for an OTP that scammers can steal, or trick customers into disclosing.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Banks in Singapore to phase out login OTPs for digital ...","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/banks-phase-out-otps-login-phishing-scams-digital-tokens-4466786?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"9 Jul 2024 \u2014 \"The digital token will authenticate customers' login without the need for an OTP that scammers can steal or trick customers into disclosing,\" ...","attribution":"CNA"},{"title":"Singapore Banks and Passkeys: Replacing SMS OTP","url":"https://www.corbado.com/blog/singapore-passkeys-banks?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"26 Jul 2024 \u2014 Discover why banks in Singapore have to phase out OTPs for more secure digital tokens and learn why passkeys are a superior replace in banking security.","attribution":"corbado.com"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":17},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":22}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Monetary Authority of Singapore"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search9\ue201","start_idx":1307,"end_idx":1339,"safe_urls":["https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digital-token","https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digital-token?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/bank-ibanking-digital-token.html","https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/bank-ibanking-digital-token.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([DBS Bank](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digital-token?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Set Up And Activate Your Digital Token With DBS","url":"https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digital-token?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"With Digital Token, you no longer face the hassle of having to bring along your physical token as it replaces all SMS OTPs or authentication through a seamless ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Your Guide to Digital Token -

System-level change you\u2019re living inside\n\n- MAS + ABS have told banks to **phase out SMS one-time passwords (OTPs)** for digital token users, starting from July 2024.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search21\ue201  \n- Concretely, if you\u2019ve enabled a **digital token inside the bank\u2019s app**, you **must use that** for login and authorisation. SMS OTP becomes either:\n  - completely unavailable, or  \n  - a restricted, low-risk fallback with limits.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \n\nSeparately, MAS is working with banks on **FIDO-compliant hardware tokens** (small USB / NFC keys) for **higher-value online transfers**, not for day-to-day low-value stuff.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 2. DBS \u2013 digibank + DBS Digital Token\n\n**What\u2019s already in force**\n\n- From **29 Jul 2024**, if you are a DBS/POSB **Digital Token** user:\n  - To log in via browser, you *must* authenticate using Digital Token.  \n  - You **can\u2019t** use SMS OTP for login anymore.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \n- DBS also explicitly restricts certain **high-risk actions** (e.g. changing limits) if you\u2019re not using Digital Token; SMS OTP is deliberately crippled as an auth method.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- For online card transactions at 3-D Secure merchants, DBS is shifting to **push notifications in the app**, not SMS OTP.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search28\ue201  \n\n**For your use case (salary in, supplier payments, card bill payment)**\n\n- **Salary in** \u2013 just incoming FAST/GIRO; no change.\n- **Paying suppliers (small amounts)** \u2013 you\u2019ll:\n  1. Log in (browser or app) \u2192 approve via DBS Digital Token.  \n  2. Submit FAST/PayNow \u2192 confirm via an in-app prompt or token-generated OTP.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search25\ue201  \n- **Paying credit card bills** \u2013 same story: log in and authorise via Digital Token. No SMS OTP.\n\nIf you\u2019re already using DBS Digital Token, your flow is basically \u201c*tap to approve on phone every time*\u201d. The \u201ctoken comeback\u201d doesn\u2019t add a second physical gadget for you here.\n\n---\n\n## 3. UOB \u2013 UOB TMRW + UOB Digital Token\n\n**Login + internet banking**\n\n- UOB\u2019s FAQ is clear: **customers on Digital Token can no longer use SMS OTP** to authenticate **Personal Internet Banking** login. You must use Digital Token instead.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n\n**Online card transactions**\n\n- For 3-D Secure (online purchases), from **end June 2025**, **SMS OTPs will no longer be available** for UOB TMRW app users. You\u2019ll authorise via Digital Token / in-app prompts instead.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n\n**For your use case**\n\n- **Salary in** \u2013 unaffected.\n- **Paying suppliers** \u2013 once logged in via UOB Digital Token, small FAST/GIRO transfers are authorised via the same digital token flow.\n- **Paying UOB credit card bills** \u2013 you\u2019ll:\n  - log in to UOB PIB \u2192 approve with Digital Token;  \n  - authorise the bill payment via Digital Token (no SMS).\n\nAgain: once Digital Token is active, treat SMS OTP as effectively dead for core UOB internet banking.\n\n---\n\n## 4. OCBC \u2013 OCBC app + OneToken\n\n**Digital token behaviour**\n\n- OCBC pushes **OneToken** as: \u201cNo hardware token, no SMS OTPs. All you need is your mobile phone once you\u2019ve activated your OneToken.\u201d\ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n- Once you activate **OCBC OneToken** on your phone:\n  - You **cannot use hardware token or SMS OTP** for OCBC Internet or Mobile Banking transactions.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search20\ue201  \n\nHardware tokens still exist mainly as:\n- a fallback for people who *haven\u2019t* moved to OneToken, and  \n- for niche channels like iOCBC trading.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\n**Upcoming changes that may hit you**\n\n- From **31 Jul 2025**, adding OCBC cards to Apple Wallet / Samsung Wallet must be authenticated with **OneToken**, not SMS OTP.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\n**For your use case**\n\n- **Salary in** \u2013 no change.\n- **Paying suppliers** \u2013 log in + pay via OCBC app/IB; both login and transaction authorisation go through OneToken.\n- **Paying OCBC credit card bills** \u2013 same pattern: app push / OneToken confirmation, no SMS OTP.\n\nIf you\u2019re already on OneToken, you are exactly where MAS/OCBC want you. You *don\u2019t* need to keep a plastic keychain around unless you\u2019re using iOCBC or deliberately refuse to move.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The \u201creturn of physical tokens\u201d \u2013 what it really means for you\n\nThe \u201ctokens are back\u201d headlines refer to **new FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) hardware tokens** MAS is working on with the banks:\n\n- They must be **plugged into or paired with your phone/computer** to approve **higher-value internet banking payments and transfers**.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- They\u2019re deliberately targeted at **high-risk, high-value actions**, *not* routine salary in or low-value bill payments.\n- Thresholds (e.g. S$X per transaction/day) have **not been publicly fixed**, so assume:\n  - everyday stuff stays on your **phone digital token**;  \n  - very big transfers / limit changes may later require **phone + hardware key**.\n\nFor your described pattern \u2013 salary receipts, small supplier payments, normal credit card bills \u2013 you\u2019re likely **below the FIDO threshold** most of the time. Expect the FIDO token to matter mainly when you:\n- send larger lumps of cash (e.g. investments, property, big one-off transfers), or  \n- change limits / contact details / security options.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Concrete action checklist (tailored to you)\n\n### Across all three banks\n\n1. **Ensure digital tokens are fully enabled**\n   - DBS: digibank app \u2192 check **Digital Token** is \u201cOn\u201d.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n   - UOB: UOB TMRW app \u2192 ensure **Digital Token** is active.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n   - OCBC: OCBC app \u2192 ensure **OneToken** is activated.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n\n2. **Lock down your phone**\n   - Strong device PIN/biometric + auto-lock.  \n   - Keep OS and banking apps updated.\n\n3. **Turn on push notifications** for all three banking apps.  \n   If push is blocked, you may miss approval prompts, making logins and payments painful.\n\n4. **Never follow banking links from SMS/WhatsApp/ads.**  \n   Always:\n   - type the URL yourself, or  \n   - use only your own bookmarks, or  \n   - launch via the official mobile app.\n\n### Contingency planning (important for a heavy user)\n\n- **Lost phone scenario**\n  - All three now impose **cooling-off periods** or additional checks when (re)activating tokens on a new device, to slow down scammers.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search29\ue201  \n  - Practically: assume you **cannot do last-minute payments** on the same day you lose your phone \u2013 keep some buffer in due dates and be prepared to go to a branch/ATM if disaster hits.\n\n- **Secondary device strategy**\n  - If your risk tolerance is low, consider:\n    - A **spare, offline-most-of-the-time phone** that can host at least one bank\u2019s token.  \n    - Or rely on **one bank** as your \u201cemergency payments\u201d channel and make sure you\u2019ve tested their lost-phone recovery flow.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Bottom line for you\n\nFor the pattern you described:\n\n- **Your workflows stay roughly the same**, but **every critical step is now tied to your mobile digital tokens**, not SMS.\n- You will **probably not need to fuss with new physical FIDO keys** for routine supplier payments and card bills; they are being designed for **higher-value / higher-risk transfers**.\n- The real practical changes you\u2019ll feel:\n  - more \u201ctap to approve\u201d prompts in apps,  \n  - less or no SMS OTP,  \n  - more friction if you change phones or try to set up tokens on new devices.\n\nIf you want, I can sketch an \u201coperational playbook\u201d for you: which bank to use as your primary outbound-payments rail, how to stagger due dates and limits, and how to design a low-friction but scam-resistant setup across DBS/UOB/OCBC."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search21\ue201","start_idx":524,"end_idx":570,"safe_urls":["https://thefintechtimes.com/singapore-banks-to-phase-out-otps-to-combat-phishing-scams/","https://thefintechtimes.com/singapore-banks-to-phase-out-otps-to-combat-phishing-scams/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/banks-phase-out-otps-login-phishing-scams-digital-tokens-4466786","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/banks-phase-out-otps-login-phishing-scams-digital-tokens-4466786?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/banks-in-singapore-to-strengthen-resilience-against-phishing-scams","https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/banks-in-singapore-to-strengthen-resilience-against-phishing-scams?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Monetary Authority of Singapore](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/banks-in-singapore-to-strengthen-resilience-against-phishing-scams?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Banks in Singapore to Strengthen Resilience Against ...","url":"https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/banks-in-singapore-to-strengthen-resilience-against-phishing-scams?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"9 Jul 2024 \u2014 Major retail banks in Singapore will progressively phase out the use of One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for bank account login by customers who are digital token ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Banks in Singapore to phase out login OTPs for digital ...","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/banks-phase-out-otps-login-phishing-scams-digital-tokens-4466786?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"9 Jul 2024 \u2014 Major banks in Singapore will phase out the use of one-time passwords (OTPs) for bank account logins by customers who are digital token users.","attribution":"CNA"},{"title":"Singapore Banks to Phase Out OTPs to Combat Phishing ...","url":"https://thefintechtimes.com/singapore-banks-to-phase-out-otps-to-combat-phishing-scams/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"11 Jul 2024 \u2014 Singapore banks will phase out OTPs for digital token users in favour of more secure authentication methods to combat phishing scams.","attribution":"The Fintech Times"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":21}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Monetary Authority of Singapore"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search19\ue201","start_idx":804,"end_idx":837,"safe_urls":["https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digital-token","https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digital-token?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/general-digibank-security-login-authentication.html?pid=sg-dbs-pweb-bank-safely-security-tools-accordion-digibank-security-login-authentication","https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/general-digibank-security-login-authentication.html?pid=sg-dbs-pweb-bank-safely-security-tools-accordion-digibank-security-login-authentication&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([DBS Bank](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digital-token?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Set Up And Activate Your Digital Token With DBS","url":"https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digital-token?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"As a measure to protect your interest, only limited types of transactions will be allowed if you use other authentication methods such as SMS OTP.
