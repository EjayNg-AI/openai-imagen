Starting with continuous-domain diffusion in 2015, researchers spent half a decade figuring out how to make the idea work for discrete text; by 2022 the first practical diffusion language models (Diffusion-LM) appeared, and since 2023 a stream of variants\u2014discrete, latent, recurrent, transformer-backed, and hybrid with LLMs\u2014has pushed perplexity toward GPT-2 levels while offering new levers for control, editing, and parallel generation.  Today the field is focused on scaling, step-count reduction, and tighter fusion with large language models, setting the stage for diffusion techniques to become a standard component in future LLM stacks.**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Foundations in Continuous Space (2015 \u2013 2020)\n\n### 1.1  Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics view  \n* **2015** \u2013 Sohl-Dickstein et al. introduced the basic denoise-backwards / noise-forwards diffusion process for deep generative modeling\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201.  \n* **2019\u20132020** \u2013 Ho et al. formalised Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for images, while Song & Ermon unified DDPM with score-based generative modeling, clarifying the relationship between denoising and gradient matching\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201.\n\nThese works all assumed **continuous data**; text generation would require a discrete counterpart.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bridging to Discrete Tokens (2021)\n\n### 2.1  Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models  \n* **D3PM (Austin et al., NeurIPS 2021)** defined diffusion directly over categorical variables with carefully designed transition matrices, proving that the forward\u2013backward machinery can work for sequences of tokens\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201.\n\nD3PM supplied the missing mathematical foundation but was not yet competitive with transformers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. First Practical Text Diffusion Models (2022)\n\n### 3.1  Diffusion-LM  \n* **Diffusion-LM (Li et al., 2022)** injected Gaussian noise into *embedding space* instead of raw tokens, enabling a transformer-based denoiser to regenerate sentences; the continuous latent path also allowed gradient-based control of syntax or sentiment during generation, outperforming earlier controllable generation baselines\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201.\n\n### 3.2  Early control & editing methods  \n* Score-based Progressive Editor (ScoPE) showed how a small diffusion network can *edit* the outputs of *black-box* autoregressive LMs by following the score of a target attribute, foreshadowing today\u2019s \u201cLLM-refinement\u201d workflows\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Expansion and Efficiency Drives (2023)\n\n| Theme | Representative Work | Key Idea |\n|-------|--------------------|----------|\n| **Latent text diffusion** | Apple ML\u2019s **Latent Language Diffusion Model** | Run diffusion in a lower-dimensional semantic space, then decode autoregressively for fluency\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201 |\n| **Transformer backbones** | **DiT** family | Replace U-Net with scalable transformers, signalling that diffusion can share the same scaling laws as LLMs \u2014initially for images, but quickly adapted to text embeddings\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn2search7\ue201 |\n| **Efficiency surveys** | Large surveys cataloguing sampling-speed tricks, distillation and rectified flows\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201 |\n\nThese studies cut generation steps from thousands to a few dozen, but perplexity still lagged GPT-2.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Toward LLM-Scale Parity (2024)\n\n### 5.1  Score-Entropy Discrete Diffusion (SEDD)  \n* Introduced a *score-entropy* loss that extends score matching to discrete spaces, achieving GPT-2-like perplexity while being up to **4.5\u00d7 faster** at inference on equal hardware\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn2search6\ue201.\n\n### 5.2  Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Models  \n* RDPM adds a small recurrent step inside each denoising iteration so that *token prediction* and *noise removal* happen jointly, reducing required steps further and bridging diffusion with classic RNN ideas\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Fusion with Large Language Models (2024 \u2013 2025)\n\n* Preprints such as **\u201cExploring the Deep Fusion of Large Language Models and Diffusion\u201d** investigate two-stage pipelines where an LLM drafts and a diffusion module refines, or vice-versa, enabling multi-modal reasoning and higher factual fidelity\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue201.  \n* Community toolkits (e.g., TextGrad) treat diffusion denoisers as gradient oracles that can steer or debug frozen LLMs through textual \u201cgradients\u201d\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Key Technical Insights\n\n1. **Discrete vs. continuous noise** \u2013 Embedding-space noise (Diffusion-LM) yields smooth gradients but sacrifices exact likelihood; token-space noise (D3PM, SEDD) retains likelihood but needs clever schedules.  \n2. **Sampling cost** \u2013 Continuous research on rectified flows, distillation, and recurrent formulations aims to cut steps below 10 while preserving diversity\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201.  \n3. **Control & editing** \u2013 The score function supplies gradients for style transfer, detoxification, or syntactic control without retraining the main LM\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201.  \n4. **Scaling laws** \u2013 Transformer-backed diffusion (DiT) suggests parameter-efficiency curves similar to autoregressive LMs, making >10 B-parameter diffusion LMs plausible\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.  \n5. **Hybrid architectures** \u2013 Latent diffusion + AR decoding strikes a quality/speed trade-off; LLM-draft + diffusion-refine pipelines target hallucination reduction\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search1\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Open Challenges & Future Directions\n\n| Challenge | Why It Matters | Emerging Ideas |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Step-count vs. quality** | Autoregressive LLMs still win on latency for chat UX | SDE\u2192ODE pruning, rectified/flow matching, diff-AR hybrids |\n| **Token re-discretisation** | Mapping continuous denoised vectors back to tokens without mode collapse | Learned vector quantisers, nearest-neighbor smoothing, lattice decoding |\n| **Long-context scaling** | BERT-style corruption scales poorly to >8 K tokens | Hierarchical noise schedules, chunked latent diffusion |\n| **Alignment & safety** | Diffusion scores give smooth control knobs \u2013 but we need RLHF-style human feedback integration | Textual gradient guidance, safety classifier conditioning |\n| **Benchmarking** | Need apples-to-apples evaluation of controllability, factuality, energy cost | Community test-beds now appearing alongside SEDD code\u200b \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n### Take-away\n\nDiffusion techniques have progressed from *\u201ccan we even denoise text?\u201d* in 2021 to **GPT-2-level discrete diffusion LMs** in 2024, and the integration wave of 2025 is beginning to blend diffusion modules with mainstream LLM pipelines.  If current reductions in step-count and hybrid training continue, controllable, parallelisable diffusion components may become as common inside future LLM stacks as attention heads are today."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201","start_idx":1030,"end_idx":1049,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Diffusion model","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1747413191.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201","start_idx":1291,"end_idx":1310,"safe_urls":["https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([yang-song.net](https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution","url":"https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1620172800.0,"snippet":"This blog post focuses on a promising new direction for generative modeling.
