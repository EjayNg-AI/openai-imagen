Using \u201cwe\u201d in a single-author math paper is **normal, orthodox, and defensible**\n\nIn mathematics (and much of theoretical CS, logic, and parts of physics):\n\n- **\u201cWe prove\u2026\u201d**  \n- **\u201cWe now show that\u2026\u201d**  \n\nare *standard idioms*, even for single-author papers.\n\nThis isn\u2019t sloppy or evasive. It\u2019s a **conventional rhetorical device**. Many top mathematicians do this reflexively.\n\nYour postdoc wasn\u2019t *wrong* to notice\u2014but his question reflects a **stylistic philosophy**, not a correctness issue.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What \u201cwe\u201d actually means (and why it feels natural)\n\nWhen mathematicians say *we*, they usually mean one of the following (often simultaneously):\n\n### (a) Author + reader\nYou\u2019re inviting the reader to *walk the proof with you*.\n\n> \u201cWe now apply the Five Lemma\u2026\u201d  \nmeans  \n> \u201cYou and I, together, now apply it.\u201d\n\nThis is pedagogically powerful. It frames proofs as *joint reasoning*, not declarations from on high.\n\n### (b) Author as representative of a mathematical community\nMathematics is cumulative. Your argument:\n- relies on shared definitions,\n- inherited techniques,\n- cultural norms of rigor.\n\nUsing \u201cwe\u201d signals that you\u2019re speaking **from inside the discipline**, not as a solitary voice inventing truths ex nihilo.\n\n### (c) Anticipated collaboration\nEspecially in PhD work, your supervisor\u2019s influence is everywhere\u2014even if the paper is formally single-authored.\n\nUsing \u201cwe\u201d implicitly acknowledges:\n- intellectual lineage,\n- informal feedback,\n- community validation.\n\nThis is *honest*, not evasive.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why some people prefer \u201cI\u201d (and why that view exists)\n\nThe postdoc\u2019s position usually comes from one (or more) of these beliefs:\n\n### (a) Radical authorial ownership\n\u201cI proved this. No one else did. So I say *I*.\u201d\n\nThis is common in:\n- philosophy,\n- some areas of pure logic,\n- certain European traditions,\n- or people who care deeply about *epistemic authorship*.\n\n### (b) Suspicion of false modesty\nSome people read \u201cwe\u201d as:\n> \u201cI\u2019m pretending this wasn\u2019t just me.\u201d\n\nThey dislike what they perceive as social camouflage.\n\n### (c) Cultural or training differences\nDifferent departments have different norms. Some supervisors actively encourage \u201cI\u201d.\n\nNone of these make \u201cwe\u201d superior or inferior\u2014they just encode different **academic identities**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Your *actual* reason is deeper\u2014and kind of revealing\n\nThis part matters:\n\n> *\u201cI always imagined being in collaboration with others, thus defaulting to \u2018we\u2019.\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s not linguistic laziness. That\u2019s a **self-model**.\n\nYou weren\u2019t saying:\n- \u201cI\u2019m not confident\u201d\n- or \u201cI\u2019m hiding\u201d\n\nYou were saying (implicitly):\n> \u201cMathematics is not a solo act\u2014even when the byline is singular.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a *very mature* view, especially for a PhD student.\n\nIt also aligns with how:\n- research actually happens,\n- ideas are refined,\n- errors are caught,\n- insight accumulates.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The joking adoption of \u201cwe/us\u201d is\u2026 extremely on brand for mathematicians\n\nThis is not weird. It\u2019s actually very mathematician-coded.\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of:\n- plural pronouns,\n- impersonal constructions,\n- depersonalized authority.\n\nIt\u2019s adjacent to:\n- \u201cLet us consider\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cOne observes that\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cIt is clear that\u2026\u201d (sometimes *not* clear \ud83d\ude04)\n\nYour joke works *because* the convention already exists.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom line (no sugar-coating)\n\n- Using **\u201cwe\u201d** in a single-author math paper is **completely legitimate**.\n- Your instinct reflects **collaborative epistemology**, not insecurity.\n- The postdoc\u2019s question reveals *his* stylistic philosophy, not a correction.\n- Neither choice is morally or mathematically superior\u2014but **\u201cwe\u201d is the dominant norm** in large parts of mathematics.\n\nIf anything, your explanation would make most senior mathematicians nod and say:\n> \u201cYes. That\u2019s exactly why we say \u2018we\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhich, ironically, proves the point.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- give examples of famous single-author papers that use \u201cwe\u201d throughout,\n- or help you decide when \u201cI\u201d actually *does* make more sense (there are cases),\n- or unpack how this choice subtly affects how a paper is *read and received*."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"sonic_classification_result":{"latency_ms":1.5016701072454453,"simple_search_prob":0.10323141051823091,"complex_search_prob":0.00022532387575129094,"no_search_prob":0.8965432656060178,"search_complexity_decision":"no_search","search_decision":false,"simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","classifier_config":{"model_name":"snc-pg-sw-3cls-ev3","renderer_name":"harmony_v4.0.15_16k_orion_text_only_no_asr_2k_action","classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","model_config_name":"chatgpt_sonic_classifier_model_config","disable_sonic_prefetch_classifier":false,"force_disabled_rate":0.0,"force_enabled_rate":0.0,"num_messages":20,"only_user_messages":false,"remove_memory":true,"support_mm":true,"n_ctx":2048,"max_action_length":4,"dynamic_set_max_message_size":false,"max_message_tokens":2000,"append_base_config":false,"no_search_token":"1","simple_search_token":"7","complex_search_token":"5","simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"prefetch_threshold":0.55,"first_turn_prefetch_threshold":null,"force_search_first_turn_threshold":1e-05,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"passthrough_tool_calls":true,"passthrough_tool_name_exclusions":["genui"],"timeout":1.0},"classifier_snapshot_id":"wli-searchdb-model5-2025-09-23-20-17","decision_source":"classifier","passthrough_tool_names":["api_tool","automations","bio","canmore","container","file_search","gcal","gcontacts","gmail","image_gen","personal_context","python","python_user_visible","user_settings"]},"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"56adbfc8-8864-408c-b54d-50040b95b9e2","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"c45f4d95-afb5-49c4-9f5e-bbe4f35a136d","turn_exchange_id":"c3ee2866-6b21-40c5-a3bc-ffa59ad2cb90"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"c45f4d95-afb5-49c4-9f5e-bbe4f35a136d","children":[]}}}
