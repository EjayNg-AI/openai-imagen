Its oxidizing power comes from the nitric acid component, while the hydrochloric acid provides chloride ions that form stable complexes with the metals dissolved.\n\nHowever, certain materials can resist the corrosive effects of aqua regia, at least to a considerable extent. Some examples include:\n\n1. **Tantalum and Niobium**: These metals can resist aqua regia under certain conditions. Tantalum, for instance, is not attacked by aqua regia at room temperature but may corrode at higher temperatures.\n\n2. **Certain ceramics and glass**: While not metals, materials like Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) and glass are highly resistant to aqua regia.\n\n3. **Iridium**: This metal is very resistant to corrosion by aqua regia. While it does dissolve slowly, iridium generally shows better resistance than platinum or gold.\n\n4. **Titanium**: Titanium resists aqua regia at room temperature but is susceptible to attack at elevated temperatures or if the aqua regia is very fresh and highly concentrated.\n\n5. **Zirconium**: Similarly to titanium, zirconium offers resistance to attack by aqua regia under specific conditions.\n\nThe resistance of these materials can vary based on factors such as the temperature and concentration of the aqua regia, as well as the presence of other substances that might catalyze or inhibit the reaction."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","default_model_slug":"gpt-4","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"3d94494b-d3a1-4d0f-bdc6-6f5b1a9fbea2","request_id":"87cc1c924c69797a-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3d94494b-d3a1-4d0f-bdc6-6f5b1a9fbea2","children":["aaa2e1ff-3696-48a2-99e5-c657469e3639"]},"aaa2e1ff-3696-48a2-99e5-c657469e3639":{"id":"aaa2e1ff-3696-48a2-99e5-c657469e3639","message":{"id":"aaa2e1ff-3696-48a2-99e5-c657469e3639","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1714539690.607082,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What chemicals in a laboratory setting can oxidize Iridium?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"87cd36c889d3a196-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3f6d95ef-467a-491c-bdd6-063c89c267bf","children":["cea67763-1640-4beb-9c0d-4e5da0e002cb"]},"cea67763-1640-4beb-9c0d-4e5da0e002cb":{"id":"cea67763-1640-4beb-9c0d-4e5da0e002cb","message":{"id":"cea67763-1640-4beb-9c0d-4e5da0e002cb","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1714539707.655148,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Iridium is highly resistant to corrosion, but certain chemicals can still oxidize it, especially under specific conditions.

Fluorine is especially effective, able to attack iridium at relatively lower temperatures compared to other halogens.\n\n3. **Oxidizing acids**:\n   - **Hot concentrated sulfuric acid**: This acid can slowly oxidize iridium, particularly at elevated temperatures.\n   - **Molten mixtures of nitric and sulfuric acids**: These can oxidize iridium more effectively, often used in processes where iridium needs to be dissolved.\n\n4. **Aqua regia**: Although iridium is highly resistant to corrosion, prolonged exposure to hot aqua regia can lead to oxidation and eventual dissolution.\n\n5. **Chlorine trifluoride and other aggressive fluorinating agents**: These compounds are extremely reactive and can oxidize almost all metals, including iridium.\n\nThe effectiveness of these oxidizers generally increases with temperature and concentration, and in many cases, the oxidation of iridium requires harsh conditions due to its exceptional resistance to attack."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","default_model_slug":"gpt-4","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa2e1ff-3696-48a2-99e5-c657469e3639","is_complete":true,"request_id":"87cd36c889d3a196-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2e1ff-3696-48a2-99e5-c657469e3639","children":["aaa2df70-c189-4a58-bbc6-57c7656da098"]},"aaa2df70-c189-4a58-bbc6-57c7656da098":{"id":"aaa2df70-c189-4a58-bbc6-57c7656da098","message":{"id":"aaa2df70-c189-4a58-bbc6-57c7656da098","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1714539807.807988,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What makes iridium so resistant?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"87cd39a398e549b4-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cea67763-1640-4beb-9c0d-4e5da0e002cb","children":["a4039627-0fb1-4767-a1c8-b2b301322dba"]},"a4039627-0fb1-4767-a1c8-b2b301322dba":{"id":"a4039627-0fb1-4767-a1c8-b2b301322dba","message":{"id":"a4039627-0fb1-4767-a1c8-b2b301322dba","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1714539853.627975,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Iridium's remarkable resistance to corrosion and oxidation stems from several intrinsic properties:\n\n1. **High Melting Point**: Iridium has a very high melting point (around 2446 degrees Celsius), which makes it stable at temperatures that would melt or significantly weaken many other metals. This high melting point is indicative of very strong metallic bonds within the iridium lattice, contributing to its durability.\n\n2. **Dense and Compact Atomic Structure**: Iridium is one of the densest elements, with tightly packed atoms that provide little space for corrosive agents to penetrate. This compact atomic structure also contributes to its high strength and durability.\n\n3. **Passivation Layer**: Like many other corrosion-resistant metals, iridium forms a passive film of oxide on its surface when exposed to oxygen. This thin layer protects the underlying metal from further attack by most acids and other corrosive materials.\n\n4. **Low Reactivity**: Chemically, iridium is a very inert metal. It does not easily form compounds with other elements, which is why it resists acids and other corrosive environments. Its electron configuration contributes to this stability, requiring considerable energy to remove electrons and form compounds.\n\n5. **Noble Metal Characteristics**: As a member of the platinum group metals, iridium shares many characteristics with other noble metals, including a reluctance to participate in chemical reactions. This reluctance is due to its filled d-electron shell, which is stable and does not readily accept additional electrons or donate its own.\n\nThese factors combine to make iridium exceptionally resistant to both mechanical and chemical wear, useful in applications where durability and longevity under extreme conditions are required."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","default_model_slug":"gpt-4","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa2df70-c189-4a58-bbc6-57c7656da098","request_id":"87cd39a398e549b4-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2df70-c189-4a58-bbc6-57c7656da098","children":[]}}}
