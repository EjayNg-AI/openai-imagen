It generalizes and extends **class field theory**, which connects abelian extensions of number fields with characters of their idele class groups, to non-abelian settings.\n\nThe central **Langlands conjecture** predicts a correspondence between:\n\n### 1. **Galois Representations**  \nThese encode how the absolute Galois group of a number field (or function field) acts on various arithmetic objects \u2014 like the \u00e9tale cohomology of algebraic varieties.\n\n### 2. **Automorphic Representations**  \nThese are certain irreducible representations of adelic algebraic groups, arising in the study of automorphic forms (generalized modular forms).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd01 Key Correspondences and Conjectures\n\nHere\u2019s a rough overview of the main branches:\n\n### \u2022 **Global Langlands Correspondence**\n- Predicts a correspondence between **n-dimensional Galois representations** and **automorphic representations** of general linear groups over global fields.\n\n### \u2022 **Local Langlands Correspondence**\n- A local analogue over **local fields** (e.g. $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, $\\mathbb{R}$). It relates representations of local Galois or Weil groups to admissible representations of $GL_n(F)$ for a local field $F$.\n\n### \u2022 **Langlands Dual Group**\n- An essential ingredient. To each reductive algebraic group $G$, there is an associated **Langlands dual group** $^L G$ which governs the structure of the correspondence.\n\n### \u2022 **Functoriality**\n- Predicts **transfers of automorphic representations** between groups according to homomorphisms of their $L$-groups. This is the most far-reaching and central conjecture.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Connections to Other Fields\n\n- **Algebraic Geometry**: Especially through the **geometric Langlands program**, which replaces number fields with function fields and uses tools like perverse sheaves, $D$-modules, and moduli stacks of $G$-bundles.\n- **Modular Forms and Elliptic Curves**: Wiles' proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem showed a case of Langlands reciprocity: that elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$ correspond to modular forms (modularity theorem).\n- **Representation Theory**: Langlands uses harmonic analysis on adelic groups to classify automorphic forms, while the geometric version uses categorified versions of these ideas.\n- **Quantum Field Theory**: The geometric Langlands program has found connections with **S-duality** in supersymmetric gauge theory (notably via work of Kapustin and Witten).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0d Broader Significance\n\n- **Unification**: Like a \u201cgrand unified theory\u201d for mathematics \u2014 drawing deep connections across disparate areas.\n- **Guiding Framework**: Even when conjectures remain unproven, the program offers powerful heuristics and methods for proving major theorems (e.g., Serre's conjecture, Sato-Tate, local-global compatibility).\n- **Open Problems**: Many parts remain conjectural \u2014 particularly in higher rank, non-tempered cases, and for exceptional groups.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Further Reading for Mathematicians\n\n1. **Introductory**\n   - *\"An Introduction to the Langlands Program\"* by Joseph Bernstein and Stephen Gelbart (Birkh\u00e4user)\n   - *Edward Frenkel\u2019s* expository articles and his popular book *\u201cLove and Math\u201d* (accessible, but also insightful)\n\n2. **Technical**\n   - *James Arthur* on the trace formula and endoscopy\n   - *Laurent Lafforgue\u2019s* work proving the global Langlands correspondence for function fields (Fields Medal, 2002)\n   - *Ng\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u*\u2019s proof of the Fundamental Lemma (Fields Medal, 2010)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 Summary\n\n**Langlands Program = Arithmetic + Geometry + Representation Theory + Analysis**\n\nIt seeks a deep unifying framework that:\n- Relates number theoretic and geometric structures (Galois representations)  \n- To analytic and algebraic structures (automorphic representations)  \n- Via functorial and group-theoretic correspondences\n\nIt has reshaped much of 20th and 21st-century mathematics and continues to evolve.\n\nWould you like a breakdown of the geometric Langlands version or some worked-out examples of known correspondences?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"9616f1079e58fcee-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"bf7bdf39-d07c-4224-9722-1e1ae4118f13","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bf7bdf39-d07c-4224-9722-1e1ae4118f13","children":["17d44943-d159-42ba-b940-d096efc91ce8"]},"17d44943-d159-42ba-b940-d096efc91ce8":{"id":"17d44943-d159-42ba-b940-d096efc91ce8","message":{"id":"17d44943-d159-42ba-b940-d096efc91ce8","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752894224.545,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I am into spectra, model categories, presentable $\\infty$-catgeories, and studying the interplay between major themes in algebraic topology and algebraic geometries through these lenses.
