Background and Purpose \n\nWith predictive modeling being an integral part of modern healthcare advancements, many \n\nresearchers have applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) and statistical techniques to improve cancer \n\nprognosis. (National Library of Medicine, 2022) In breast cancer survival prediction, traditional \n\nmodels like the Cox Proportional Hazards model are widely used to estimate survival \n\nprobabilities, but their predictive performance can be enhanced by integrating machine learning \n\nmethods. Techniques such as neural networks and random forests offer unique strengths, \n\nincluding the ability to handle nonlinear interactions and high-dimensional data. \n\n \n\nThis project aims to investigate and identify the optimal combination of the Cox Proportional \n\nHazards model with machine learning methods to enhance survival prediction accuracy. By \n\nsystematically evaluating these approaches, the project seeks to determine the most effective \n\nintegration for improved risk stratification, survival curve estimation, and personalized treatment \n\nplanning. \n\n \n\n2. Literature Review  \n\n2.1 About the Cox Model \n\nThe cox model is a regression technique used for performing survival analysis in \n\nepidemiological and clinical research. (National Library of Medicine, 2021) It is based on the \n\nhazards function, and is written mathematically as \u210e(\ud835\udc61; \ud835\udc65) = \u210e0(\ud835\udc61) \u00d7 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d [\ud835\udc4f1\ud835\udc651 +\n\n\ud835\udc4f2\ud835\udc652+. . . +\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58], where \u210e(\ud835\udc61; \ud835\udc65) is the hazard function at time \ud835\udc61 for subject with covariate values \n\n\ud835\udc651,...,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58, \u210e0(\ud835\udc61) is the baseline hazard function, \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d is the exponential function \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 is the \ud835\udc56th \n\ncovariate in the model and \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 is the regression coefficient for the \ud835\udc56th covariate \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56. (University of \n\nMichigan, 2006) Due to the baseline hazard function \u210e0(\ud835\udc61) being assumed to be unknown, in \n\norder to see the proportional hazards model analytically, we have to take the ratio of \u210e(\ud835\udc61; \ud835\udc65) for \n\ntwo different covariate values, for example \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57, which will give us an equation like \n\nthis:\n\u210e(\ud835\udc61;\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)\n\n\u210e(\ud835\udc61;\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57)\n=\n\n\u210e0\ud835\udc61 \u00d7 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d [\ud835\udc4f1\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc561+\ud835\udc4f2\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc562+...+\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58] \n\n\u210e0\ud835\udc61 \u00d7 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d [\ud835\udc4f1\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc571+\ud835\udc4f2\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc572+...+\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc58]\n= \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d [\ud835\udc4f1(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc561 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc571) + \ud835\udc4f2(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc562 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc572)+. . . +\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58 \u2212\n\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc58)].  \n\n\n\nWe chose to use the cox model as it is ideal for performing cancer survival analysis for our \n\nproject as it is able to evaluate the effect that many factors have on survival at the same time, \n\nwhich is useful for our research by allowing us to see how our factors influence the survival rate \n\nof cancer patients across a period of time, and is realistic to real-world situations as it accounts \n\nfor censorship  \n\n2.2 Accounting for Censorship in the Cox model \n\nCensoring is a feature whereby the time-to-event analysis precludes or excludes observation of \n\nthe event (National Library of Medicine, 2018), which can be further broken down into 3 \n\ndifferent types: left censoring, which occurs when it is known the event happened at time t, but \n\nthe initial time of occurrence is unknown, right censoring, which occurs when the event happens \n\nafter the start of the observation and interval censoring, whereby the random variable of interest \n\nis known to only lie with a certain interval instead of being observed directly. (National Library \n\nof Medicine, 2010) The Cox model accounts for this censorship by incorporating it into the \n\nlikelihood function, which is why we decided to use the Cox model as this makes it suitable for \n\nreal-world scenarios.  \n\nFirstly, suppose we have our patients, \ud835\udc5d, where the mean time-to-failure, which in our case is \n\ntime-to-death, has the survival function \ud835\udc46 and density function \ud835\udc53, both of which are \n\nparameterised by a parameter \ud835\udf03. If the patient is observed to have passed away at time 0 \u2264 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56 \u2264\n\n\ud835\udc47, then we will incorporate it into the likelihood function using \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udf03), in which case there is no \n\nright censorship as the result of the patient passing away is within our observation period. \n\nHowever, if the patient is observed to have survived through our entire observation period from 0 \n\nto \ud835\udc47, we will not know whether or not the result of the patient passing away has happened, thus \n\nthis will be considered a right censored data point, and we will incorporate it into the likelihood \n\nfunction \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc47|\ud835\udf03) instead.  \n\nAssuming our survival model is based on the observing only for an observation period of \ud835\udc47 and \n\nthe time-to-death are all independently and identically distributed (IID) conditional on some \n\nunderlying parameters, then without further loss of generality, we will observe \ud835\udc5b observed failure \n\ntimes \ud835\udc611,...,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5b within our observation period of [0, \ud835\udc47] and \ud835\udc5a right censored values that did not fail \n\nwithin time \ud835\udc47, as they happen after our observation period has ended. The overall likelihood \n\nfunction for this data is then given by \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf03)  =  (\u220f\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udf03)) \u00d7 \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc47|\ud835\udf03)\ud835\udc5a.  \n\n\n\nThrough this likelihood function, we can see how censorship is accounted for as the censoring of \n\ndata is \u201cbuilt in\u201d as right-censored values are incorporated through their survival function instead \n\nof the density function for the time-to-death. \n\nConsidering these, we can now extend to the Cox model, which also uses the likelihood function \n\nfor observing time-to-death and survival times, but now adds in covariates, which are \n\nindependent variables that can influence the outcome of a given statistical trial, but which is not \n\nof direct interest, to the data and uses an assumption of proportional hazards in how these \n\nmanifest in the hazard function. While the method in which the censored data are built into the \n\nlikelihood function is still similar to the above survival model, there is a possibility that we \n\nobserve items up to different endpoints, in which case right-censored values would occur with \n\ndifferent observation periods \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5b+1,...,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5b+\ud835\udc5a. In this case, the likelihood function would be \n\ngeneralised to: \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf03)  =  (\u220f\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udf03)) \u00d7 (\u220f\ud835\udc5a\n\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5b+1|\ud835\udf03)\ud835\udc5a), thus showing how the Cox \n\nmodel accounts for right censorship. \n\nFor the case of left censorship, which means the patient has died before our observation period \n\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56, the left-censored observations will enter into the likelihood function through the cumulative \n\ndistribution function \ud835\udc39, whereby the cumulative distribution function gives us the probability \n\nthat the random variable \ud835\udc4b is less than or equal to \ud835\udc65. Extending this to our model again, \n\nassuming we have \ud835\udc5f left-censored observations with observation times \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a+\ud835\udc5b+\ud835\udc56,...,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a+\ud835\udc5b+\ud835\udc5f then the \n\nlikelihood function would be further generalised to: \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf03)  =  (\u220f\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udf03)) \u00d7\n\n(\u220f\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5b+1|\ud835\udf03)\ud835\udc5a) \u00d7 (\u220f\ud835\udc5f\n\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a+\ud835\udc5b+\ud835\udc56 |\ud835\udf03)), thus showing how the Cox model accounts for \n\nleft censorship. \n\nThus, this shows how the Cox model is ideal for our cancer-survival analysis, owing to how it, \n\nunlike other survival models, accounts for censorship, which is useful for real-life scenarios. \n\n \n\n2.3 About Random Forest \n\nRandom Forest is a method that is based on taking the combination of predictive trees, also \n\nknown as weak classifiers, whereby each tree is constructed from a random selection of samples \n\nand variables. One unique benefit of Random Forest is that it has higher discriminatory power \n\ncompared to other models. (Science Direct, 2019)  \n\n \n\n2. About Deep Learning \n\n\n\nDeep learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating large neural network \n\nmodels that are capable of making data-driven decisions. Some of the tasks that deep learning is \n\nmost capable of performing includes classification, regression, and representation learning. One \n\nof the benefits of using deep learning is that it is suitable for contests whereby the data is \n\ncomplex and the datasets are large.  (The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2019)  \n\n \n\n3. Methodology  \n\n3.1 Continuous Improvement of Models  \n\nInitially, after hyperparameter tuning, the standalone Cox Proportional Hazards model yielded \n\nthe following C-index values, detailed in Annex A. The model was trained on the SEER dataset, \n\nwhich comprises clinical and demographic information of breast cancer patients; specifics of this \n\ndataset are provided in Annex B.  \n\n \n\n3.2 Integration of Predictive Techniques    \n\nTo improve the model, the baseline Cox Proportional Hazards model was paired with advanced \n\nmachine learning methods, namely Neural Networks and Random Forests.. To predict survival \n\nrates, a two-step approach is employed. First, a random forest model and a deep learning neural \n\nnetwork were used to calculate a risk score for each patient based on the features from the SEER \n\ndataset. The risk score represents the likelihood of death based on input features derived from \n\npatient data.  \n\n \n\nThe risk scores calculated from the machine learning model are integrated into the Cox model as \n\ncovariates. The model estimates hazard ratios based on these scores, enabling the prediction of \n\nsurvival curves for individual patients. Survival curves represent the probability of surviving \n\nbeyond a specific time point, offering detailed insights into patient prognosis. (Refer to Annex C \n\nfor an example of a survival curve generated) \n\n \n\n4. Interpretation of Data, Results, and Findings  \n\nTo evaluate our models' performance in predicting risk scores, we utilized Harrell's Concordance \n\nIndex (C-index), a metric that measures the agreement between predicted and actual event \n\norderings in survival analysis. (Owkin, 2023) \n\n(The results of the models can be found in Annex A) \n\nBased on the data, it is evident that the Random Forest model was able to better predict the risk \n\nscores compared to the deep learning model. Additionally, when paired with the Cox \n\nProportional Hazards model, the Random Survival Forest model resulted in a higher C-index, \n\ndemonstrating better concordance between the predicted and actual survival outcomes. As a \n\n\n\nresult, we chose this combination of the Cox model and Random Forest as our final improved \n\nmodel to predict breast cancer survival rates.  \n\n \n\n5. Conclusion and Recommendation \n\nAs demonstrated throughout the analysis, the ability to input a patient's specific features and \n\ngenerate an accurate survival curve is an invaluable tool for breast cancer patients and their \n\nmedical teams. The final model we've developed, which combines the predictive power of the \n\nRandom Survival Forest algorithm with the Cox Proportional Hazards model, has shown a strong \n\nC-index, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting survival rates. This is a significant \n\nachievement because it allows for more precise risk assessments, helping doctors make better-\n\ninformed decisions regarding treatment plans and the patient\u2019s prognosis. \n\n \n\nIn real-life applications, this model has the potential to be a game-changer in clinical settings. By \n\nusing this model, healthcare providers can tailor treatment options to each individual patient \n\nbased on their predicted survival curve, rather than relying on generic approaches. This \n\npersonalized strategy can ultimately improve patient outcomes and contribute to more targeted \n\ntherapies, ultimately giving patients and doctors the confidence to make decisions that align with \n\nthe best possible survival outcomes. \n\nThe model\u2019s ability to provide accurate predictions with just a few key features makes it a crucial \n\ntool in the fight against breast cancer, offering hope for more precise and effective care. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6. Future Work \n\nA key next step for this project is to pilot the model in real-world clinical settings, particularly in \n\nhospitals and cancer treatment centers. By implementing the model in a controlled clinical \n\nenvironment, we can assess its practicality and performance when used by medical professionals. \n\nThis would allow doctors to input patient data and generate survival curves to aid in decision-\n\nmaking for breast cancer treatment. Feedback from healthcare providers during this phase would \n\nbe invaluable for identifying areas where the model can be refined, whether through improving \n\nthe accuracy of predictions or making the interface more user-friendly for clinical use. \n\nUltimately, piloting the model in real-life settings would provide important insights into its \n\neffectiveness, ensuring that it is a reliable and impactful tool for improving patient outcomes in \n\nbreast cancer care. \n\n \n\n\n\n7.

Some sections, like the detailed mathematical derivation of the Cox model, are overly technical for a general audience. It would be helpful to move this into an appendix if targeting a broader audience.\n   - There are occasional grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., \"censorship\" instead of \"censoring\").\n\n2. **Literature Review Depth**:\n   - While the Cox model and Random Forest are well-explained, the deep learning section is superficial. Including details about the neural network architecture, layers, and activation functions would improve technical depth.\n\n3. **Results Interpretation**:\n   - The report states that the Cox model with Random Survival Forest outperforms other methods, but the analysis lacks depth. For example:\n     - Why does Random Survival Forest perform better?\n     - How does the model generalize across diverse patient demographics?\n   - Including confidence intervals or statistical significance tests for the C-index values would enhance credibility.\n\n4. **Data Preprocessing**:\n   - The report mentions preprocessing (Annex B), but the steps are not explicitly described. Were missing values imputed? Were features normalized or scaled?\n\n5. **Visual Aids**:\n   - While survival curves are mentioned (Annex C), they are not shown in the text. Including visualizations of survival curves or feature importance from the Random Forest model would make the findings more accessible.\n\n6. **Future Work**:\n   - The recommendation to pilot the model in clinical settings is commendable but lacks specificity. For example:\n     - What challenges are anticipated in real-world deployment?\n     - How will patient privacy and data security be managed?\n\n7. **References**:\n   - Some references lack complete citations (e.g., page numbers, publication details). Ensuring all references adhere to a consistent format would enhance professionalism.\n\n---\n\n### Suggestions for Further Enhancements:\n1. Add a brief \"Key Findings\" section in the results to summarize insights in a non-technical manner.\n2. Provide a direct comparison of the computational efficiency of the models (e.g., training time).\n3. Highlight potential limitations, such as sample size, feature availability, or biases in the dataset.\n\n---\n\nOverall, the project report is solid and demonstrates a strong understanding of survival analysis and machine learning. Addressing the outlined areas for improvement would enhance its clarity, rigor, and appeal to a broader audience."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"179cac13-b8c3-4077-9d11-004e03d321ef","request_id":"900294067a3a40fb-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"179cac13-b8c3-4077-9d11-004e03d321ef","children":[]}}}
