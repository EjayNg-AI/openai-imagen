(a) Prove that \\(f\\) is differentiable almost everywhere and that its derivative \\(f'\\) is Lebesgue integrable on \\([a,b]\\).\n\n   (b) Prove the **Lebesgue version of the fundamental theorem of calculus**: for every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\),\n   \\[\n   f(x) = f(a) + \\int_a^x f'(t)\\,dt,\n   \\]\n   where the integral is the Lebesgue integral.\n\n---\n\n### Question 7 \u2013 Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem and uniqueness of density\n\nLet \\((X,\\Sigma)\\) be a measurable space, \\(\\lambda\\) a \\(\\sigma\\)-finite measure on \\((X,\\Sigma)\\), and \\(\\mu\\) a finite measure on \\((X,\\Sigma)\\) such that \\(\\mu\\) is **absolutely continuous** with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) (i.e. \\(\\lambda(A)=0\\Rightarrow \\mu(A)=0\\) for all \\(A\\in\\Sigma\\)).\n\n1. (a) State the **Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem** in this setting.\n\n   (b) Using the Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem, show that there exists a function \\(f\\in L^1(\\lambda)\\) such that\n   \\[\n   \\mu(A) = \\int_A f\\,d\\lambda \\quad\\text{for all }A\\in\\Sigma.\n   \\]\n\n   (c) Prove that this function \\(f\\) is unique up to \\(\\lambda\\)-almost everywhere equality; that is, if \\(g\\in L^1(\\lambda)\\) also satisfies \\(\\mu(A) = \\int_A g\\,d\\lambda\\) for all \\(A\\in\\Sigma\\), then \\(f=g\\) almost everywhere.\n\n---\n\n### Question 8 \u2013 Uniform integrability and convergence in \\(L^1\\) (more advanced)\n\nLet \\((X,\\Sigma,\\mu)\\) be a finite measure space. A family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\subset L^1(\\mu)\\) is said to be **uniformly integrable** if for every \\(\\varepsilon>0\\) there exists \\(\\delta>0\\) such that for all measurable \\(E\\in\\Sigma\\) with \\(\\mu(E)<\\delta\\),\n\\[\n\\int_E |f|\\,d\\mu < \\varepsilon \\quad\\text{for all } f\\in\\mathcal{F}.\n\\]\n\nLet \\((f_n)\\subset L^1(\\mu)\\) be a uniformly integrable sequence such that \\(f_n\\to f\\) in measure, for some \\(f\\in L^1(\\mu)\\).\n\n1. (a) Prove that \\(f_n\\to f\\) in \\(L^1(\\mu)\\); that is,\n   \\[\n   \\int_X |f_n-f|\\,d\\mu \\;\\longrightarrow\\; 0.\n   \\]\n\n   (b) Give an example showing that convergence in measure plus boundedness in \\(L^1\\) (that is, \\(\\sup_n \\|f_n\\|_1<\\infty\\)) does **not** imply uniform integrability, and may fail to give convergence in \\(L^1\\).\n\n---\n\nThese eight questions, with subparts, are roughly the level and flavour I\u2019d expect: they require you to know the main theorems (monotone/ Fatou/ dominated convergence, product measures, \\(L^p\\) theory, Radon\u2013Nikodym, absolute continuity) **and** to deploy them in nontrivial proofs and constructions, rather than just quoting them. If you\u2019d like, I can next turn this into a full mock exam with point allocations and then (separately) work through complete solutions."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"0752a7e2-581d-46ea-93f5-4758c57f5774","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"51e87f4b-0bd6-46b8-8e0e-035a46e1eedf","turn_exchange_id":"931133f1-c5c1-43f9-8c1d-2ac9d093e12e","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"51e87f4b-0bd6-46b8-8e0e-035a46e1eedf","children":[]}}}
