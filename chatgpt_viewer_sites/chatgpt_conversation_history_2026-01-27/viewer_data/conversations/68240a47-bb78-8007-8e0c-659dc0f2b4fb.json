Reduced `.hero` padding from `6rem 0 7rem` to `4rem 0 5rem`, lifting the next section into immediate view. |\n| **Bright-orange headline** | Added `--accent` (`#ff6b00`) to `:root`; set `h1` colour to `var(--accent)` only inside the hero. |\n| **Sticky header + placeholder menu** | New `.site-header` element before hero:<br>\u2022 `position:sticky; top:0; z-index:100` keeps it in view.<br>\u2022 Flex layout for logo and menu.<br>\u2022 Menu wording mirrors themathlab.com.sg (\u201cAbout, Programmes, Bootcamp, Results, Blog, Contact\u201d). |\n\nPaste this file over the earlier version (or just append the unchanged lower sections) and the hero will no longer cover subsequent content, the headline will pop in orange, and visitors will always see your navigation bar as they scroll."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"486951a9-f5c3-4bcb-808a-028389b5b1ae","request_id":"93f8730d9ec7ce6d-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"486951a9-f5c3-4bcb-808a-028389b5b1ae","children":["d5092c82-77d9-486d-9a8f-1ed040c9cdee"]},"d5092c82-77d9-486d-9a8f-1ed040c9cdee":{"id":"d5092c82-77d9-486d-9a8f-1ed040c9cdee","message":{"id":"d5092c82-77d9-486d-9a8f-1ed040c9cdee","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1747205734.395,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["how

exactly where\u2014and how\u2014to edit the page so you can fine-tune   \n\n* **the grey band\u2019s height** (i.e., how tall the hero zone is)  \n* **its background colour / shade of grey**\n\n---\n\n## 1  Locate the relevant CSS rules\n\nIn the file I sent, the hero band is controlled by two rules:\n\n```css\n.hero {                       /* sets the height & the image */\n  position: relative;\n  color: var(--light);\n  background: url('...jpg') center/cover no-repeat;\n  padding: 4rem 0 5rem;       /*  \u2190  height comes from these paddings  */\n}\n\n.hero::after {                /* dark overlay sitting on top */\n  content: '';\n  position: absolute;\n  inset: 0;\n  background: rgba(0,0,0,.55);/*  \u2190  grey overlay colour + opacity  */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2  Change the **height**\n\nThe hero\u2019s vertical size is entirely from the `padding` on `.hero`.\n\n* *Shorter:*\u2003reduce the first and last numbers (top & bottom).  \n  ```css\n  padding: 3rem 0 3.5rem;   /* ~20 % shorter */\n  ```\n* *Taller:*\u2003increase them.  \n  ```css\n  padding: 6rem 0 7rem;     /* back to the \u201ctall\u201d original */\n  ```\n\n> **Tip:** Use any CSS length unit\u2014`rem`, `px`, `vh` (viewport height).  \n> E.g. `padding: 12vh 0;` makes the section exactly 12 % of the viewport\u2019s height.\n\n---\n\n## 3  Change the **grey colour / opacity**\n\nThe apparent \u201cgrey\u201d is the overlay in `.hero::after`:\n\n```css\nbackground: rgba(0,0,0,.55);\n```\n\n* **Lighter grey:** lower the alpha (last number).  \n  ```css\n  background: rgba(0,0,0,.35);   /* lighter \u2013 more of the image shows through */\n  ```\n* **Darker grey / almost black:** raise the alpha.  \n  ```css\n  background: rgba(0,0,0,.75);   /* darker overlay */\n  ```\n* **Different hue:** change the RGB values.  \n  ```css\n  background: rgba(64,64,64,.60);   /* solid mid-grey */\n  background: rgba(255,111,0,.50);  /* brand orange tint, 50 % opaque */\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 4  Replace the image with a flat grey (optional)\n\nIf you don\u2019t want an image at all\u2014just a plain block of colour:\n\n1. **Remove** the `background:url(...)` on `.hero`.\n2. **Add** `background-color:` in its place.\n\n```css\n.hero{\n  position: relative;\n  color: var(--light);\n  background-color:#ececec;   /* any grey you like */\n  padding: 3.5rem 0;          /* height still controlled here */\n}\n```\n\nThen you can delete the entire `.hero::after` rule because you no longer need an overlay.\n\n---\n\n## 5  Live-tweak with browser dev tools\n\n1. Open the page in Chrome/Edge/Firefox.  \n2. Press **F12** (or right-click \u2192 *Inspect*).  \n3. Find `.hero` in the *Elements* panel.  \n   * Change padding values or colours in real time\u2014see immediate results.  \n4. Copy your preferred numbers back into the actual CSS file.\n\n---\n\n**That\u2019s it.** Adjust those two small properties and you can make the hero zone any height or grey tone you want without disturbing the rest of the page."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"c10d8b5e-58c0-4ec3-aebe-af9db90bde92","request_id":"93f87da02eacce6d-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"c10d8b5e-58c0-4ec3-aebe-af9db90bde92","children":[]}}}
