It is a \u201ctrace-and-polish\u201d job.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS (must follow):\n1) Preserve 100% of the original information and structure. Do NOT add, remove, rewrite, paraphrase, or reorder anything.\n2) All text, numbers, symbols, equations, headings, punctuation, and line breaks must remain EXACTLY the same as the source image.\n   - Keep \u201cFind the HCF of 40, 60 and 100.\u201d\n   - Keep \u201c*Solution\u201d\n   - Keep \u201cMethod 1: Prime factorisation\u201d, the \u201cor\u201d between the two method-1 diagrams, and every label (e.g., \u201ccommon prime factors\u201d, \u201ccommon factors are 2^2 and 5, i.e. choose each of the common prime factors with the smallest index\u201d, etc.)\n   - Keep all occurrences of \u00d7, =, exponents (e.g., 2^3, 5^2), and every arrow/box.\n3) Preserve the layout: same two sections (Method 1 on top, Method 2 below), same relative positions of diagrams, arrows, and boxes.\n4) If any character is unclear, DO NOT guess. Instead, retain the original pixels for that text region (so content stays correct).\n\nWHAT TO IMPROVE (allowed changes):\n- Increase clarity and aesthetics while keeping everything identical in meaning and placement.\n- Clean, high-resolution, print-ready infographic look.\n- Straighten alignment, consistent spacing, consistent line weights.\n- Replace hand-drawn/rough lines with crisp vector-style lines.\n- Make arrows consistent (same arrowhead style/size), and boxes consistent (same stroke width, neat corners).\n- Improve typography (clear, readable fonts; math typesetting clean). Keep bold/italics emphasis where it appears in the original.\n- Subtle educational color accents are allowed ONLY to highlight existing elements (e.g., light tints behind the boxed prime factors), but do not introduce new symbols or callouts.\n- Background should be clean white with generous whitespace. No textures, no patterns.\n\nSTYLE TARGET:\nModern textbook/worksheet infographic: minimal, elegant, high legibility, \u201cvectorized\u201d cleanliness.\nNo cartoons, no 3D, no extra icons/mascots, no watermarks, no logos.\n\nOUTPUT:\nReturn a single polished image with the same aspect ratio as the original, higher resolution (print-friendly).\n```\n\nIf your tool supports a separate **negative prompt**, paste this there:\n\n```text\nDo not add new text. Do not change any numbers. Do not paraphrase. Do not translate. Do not invent extra explanations. Do not change layout. No decorative icons, characters, cartoons, 3D effects, gradients-heavy styling, watermarks, or logos.\n```\n\nIf you want, tell me your target format (A4 portrait vs 16:9 slide) and whether you prefer **pure grayscale** or **subtle color accents**, and I\u2019ll tighten the prompt to that output spec."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"faf838d3-6d1e-468f-8cde-019a736c95b9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"3aa4312f-4730-4eb8-a238-59474e9cce27","turn_exchange_id":"e0e184d1-e42f-4b1f-9bf3-4e54fdbd639b"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"3aa4312f-4730-4eb8-a238-59474e9cce27","children":[]}}}
