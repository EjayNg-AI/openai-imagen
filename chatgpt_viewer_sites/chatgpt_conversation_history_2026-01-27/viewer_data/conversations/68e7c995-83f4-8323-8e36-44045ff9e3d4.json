officials were cautious about inflation as they agreed rate cuts","snippet":"In September 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the U.S. Federal Reserve cut the benchmark interest rate by 0.25% to a target range of 4\u20134.25%, marking the first rate reduction of the year. This decision came amid weakening labor market indicators and increased pressure from President Donald Trump for looser monetary policy. However, meeting minutes revealed internal divisions, with some officials preferring to hold rates steady due to concerns about persistent inflation. Inflation, as measured by the Fed\u2019s preferred index, rose to 2.7% in August, slightly above the July level, stalling progress toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Some policymakers feared that prolonged inflation could raise long-term expectations. Although 11 of the 12 voting FOMC members supported the rate cut, Stephen Miran, recently appointed and aligned with Trump, advocated for a larger cut. Miran also predicted deeper rate reductions than the majority. The committee remains cautious, balancing inflation concerns against signs of a softening labor market. Meanwhile, Trump continues efforts to influence Fed policy, including a failed attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":48},"pub_date":1759948665.969,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-williams-backs-more-rate-cuts-this-year-due-labor-market-slowdown-risks-he-2025-10-09/","title":"Fed's Williams backs more rate cuts this year due to labor market slowdown risks, he tells NYT","snippet":"In an October 9, 2025, interview with the New York Times, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams expressed support for additional interest rate cuts this year due to concerns about a possible labor market slowdown. Although Williams acknowledged these risks, he clarified that they do not signal an imminent recession. His remarks support the Federal Reserve's recent decision to lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point in September, aiming to balance inflation control with job market stability.\n\nWilliams emphasized the importance of reducing inflation without aggressively cooling the labor market and underscored the need to protect the Fed's credibility. The Fed's meeting minutes from September 16-17 reflect agreement among officials on the increased labor market risks warranting rate cuts, while still recognizing the challenge of persisting high inflation. The next policy meeting is scheduled for October 28-29, with markets anticipating another quarter-point rate reduction.\n\nWilliams also reaffirmed the importance of the central bank's independence amidst political pressure, referencing President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook and his push for more aggressive rate cuts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1760006342.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/s-and-p-500-gains-and-losses-today-ai-fueled-rally-powers-index-to-fresh-high-11826428","title":"S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: AI-Fueled Rally Powers Index to Fresh High","snippet":"On October 8, 2025, the S&P 500 rose 0.6%, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.1% to achieve new closing highs, driven by strong gains in the technology sector and dovish signals from the latest Federal Reserve meeting pointing toward potential interest rate cuts.

The increase was mainly driven by higher prices for communication, personal care, and recreational products. This surge followed the elimination in August of the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, which had allowed imports under $800 to enter tax-free\u2014affecting smaller, easily bundled products like phones and gaming consoles.\n\nMeanwhile, appliance prices remained flat after earlier gains, and home improvement goods saw a deceleration in price growth. This suggests that previous tariff increases have largely been absorbed by this category and are no longer contributing to inflation. The U.S. government shutdown, now in its second week, has paused official economic reports such as the Consumer Price Index, leaving investors reliant on private data sources like OpenBrand.

The Fed acknowledged persistent inflation, especially in core goods due to tariffs, even as services inflation appears more stable. The minutes revealed policymakers are open to further interest rate cuts, especially as labor market data shows signs of weakening. The Fed aims to reduce inflation to its 2% target by 2027, though most officials noted upside risks such as the potential persistence of elevated inflation even after tariff effects fade.\n\nThe 2-year Treasury yield slightly rose to 3.581%, though it has dropped significantly over the year. The 10-year yield remained relatively flat at 4.128%, with expectations it may stay between 4% and 4.5%. Investors are increasingly turning to inflation-protected securities like the Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF, which has returned 7.1% year-to-date and seen $2 billion in inflows. Analysts from firms like BlackRock and L&G Asset Management underscored the importance of balancing inflation control with labor market conditions, anticipating that the Fed may cut rates again in upcoming meetings due to economic softness.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1759963800.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"home.treasury.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?field_tdr_date_value=2025&type=daily_treasury_yield_curve","title":"Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates 2025","snippet":"Jan 2, 2025 \u2014 This method provides a par yield for a 10-year maturity, for example, even if no outstanding security has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"home.treasury.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?field_tdr_date_value_month=202204.&type=daily_treasury_real_yield_curve","title":"Daily Treasury Par Real Yield Curve Rates","snippet":"This method provides a par real yield for a 10-year maturity, for example, even if no outstanding security has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity.

Losses Hit Black, Asian, and Hispanic Workers Hard, Raising Concerns for All Americans","snippet":"In 2025, unemployment among Black, Hispanic, and Asian American workers has risen significantly, in contrast to a slight decline in joblessness among white workers. Economic disparities have been exacerbated by structural issues like industry concentration, educational inequities, and a history of discrimination. Additional recent challenges\u2014including chaotic federal policy changes such as mass deportations, workforce cuts, and broad tariffs\u2014have further hurt economic stability.\n\nIn August, Black unemployment rose to 7.5%, a 25% increase since May, with Black women particularly affected. Hispanic and Asian unemployment each increased to 5.3% and 3.7%, respectively, while white unemployment slightly declined to 3.7%. Despite strong labor force participation among people of color, they are still experiencing disproportionate job losses.\n\nThis trend echoes historical patterns, such as during the 2008\u20132009 Great Recession, when unemployment surged more sharply among workers of color. Structural issues, including inadequate policies to reduce inequities, continue to drive these disparities. New factors\u2014such as automation, inflation, and economic policy shifts\u2014are disproportionately hurting frontline and low-wage jobs, which are more likely held by workers of color. Experts warn that these developments will harm not just affected communities but the broader economy through reduced consumer spending and tax revenue.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1759946875.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.axios.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/03/government-shutdown-jobs-report-september-adp","title":"Hiring data suggests an unusual economic dynamic at play","snippet":"Hiring data from September 2025 indicates a continued stagnation in the labor market, with the ADP report showing a loss of 32,000 private sector jobs. August's previously reported gains were revised down to a slight loss, further emphasizing weak employment growth throughout the summer and into early fall. Due to an ongoing government shutdown, key labor market indicators like the monthly jobs report are delayed, increasing uncertainty for policymakers. A real-time estimate by the Chicago Fed suggested the unemployment rate held steady at 4.3% in September, despite data limitations. This situation complicates decision-making for the Federal Reserve, which is weighing another interest rate cut amid signs of labor market weakness. However, reliance on private data, which is less consistent than official government sources, presents challenges. At their previous meeting, Fed members signaled the likelihood of two more rate cuts in 2025. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee also highlighted a scarcity of reliable private-sector sources for inflation data, in contrast to labor data.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1759507568.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-goolsbee-little-wary-front-loading-too-many-rate-cuts-cnbc-2025-10-03/","title":"Fed's Goolsbee a 'little wary' of front-loading too many rate cuts -CNBC","snippet":"Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee expressed caution about implementing multiple interest rate cuts while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Speaking on CNBC, Goolsbee highlighted a challenging economic environment marked by rising services inflation and weakening job growth, calling it a \"sticky spot\" for policy decisions. He warned against overly relying on expected inflation declines to justify front-loading rate cuts. The Fed recently cut the rate by 0.25%, but Goolsbee and other regional Presidents are hesitant to support additional cuts due to persistent inflation. A federal government shutdown has paused key economic reports, including jobs data; however, Chicago Fed's model estimates September\u2019s unemployment rate at 4.3%, suggesting continued labor market stability. Job growth has been slowing, partly due to President Trump's immigration policies, but unemployment remains historically low.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1759499632.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-unemployment-rate-likely-steady-43-september-chicago-fed-says-2025-10-02/","title":"US unemployment rate likely steady at 4.3% in September, Chicago Fed says","snippet":"The U.S. unemployment rate likely remained steady at 4.3% in September, unchanged from August, according to a new real-time estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. This is only the second release of this metric, which combines data from the government\u2019s Current Population Survey with inputs from non-government sources like Indeed and Google. The estimate is meant to provide early labor market insight and has gained importance due to the indefinite delay of the official Bureau of Labor Statistics report caused by the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized the provisional role of the new metric during data shortages. Last month, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter-point due to weakening job growth and a slight rise in unemployment. Policymakers view such adjustments as preemptive measures against potential labor market deterioration. The latest Chicago Fed estimate shows only minor changes in hiring and separation rates, suggesting no immediate sharp weakening. Financial markets continue to expect further quarter-point rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meetings in October and December.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},"pub_date":1759408284.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-job-openings-increase-moderately-august-hiring-declines-2025-09-30/","title":"US job openings increase moderately in August; hiring ...","snippet":"Sep 30, 2025 \u2014 U.S. job openings increased marginally in August while hiring declined, consistent with softening labor market conditions that could allow ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1759242053.063,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bls.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm","title":"Employment Situation Summary - 2025 M08 Results","snippet":"Sep 5, 2025 \u2014 The unemployment rate, at 4.3 ...

According to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the sector\u2019s employment index slightly improved from 46.5 to 47.2, but remained below the 50 mark, indicating continued shrinkage. Overall activity in the sector also stagnated, with the ISM Services PMI dropping to 50, a standstill level and below economists' expectations of 52.\n\nDespite its previous resilience to tariffs compared to manufacturing, the service sector is now facing hiring delays and challenges in finding qualified staff. Inflationary pressures persist, with ISM's price index climbing to 69.4, the second-highest since October 2022 and continuing a 10-month streak above 60.\n\nThis economic slowdown places the Federal Reserve in a challenging position. With some data delayed due to a government shutdown and inflation remaining elevated, economists predict the Fed may be forced to consider another interest rate cut to support the weakening labor market. Markets responded with rising stock prices and a climb in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.120%.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1759505160.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-services-sector-sees-modest-growth-september-pmi-shows-2025-10-03/","title":"German services sector sees modest growth in September, PMI shows","snippet":"In September 2025, Germany's services sector experienced its fastest growth in eight months, with the HCOB services PMI rising to 51.5, up from 49.3 in August and staying in expansion territory. Although slightly below the preliminary reading of 52.5, this growth, combined with increased manufacturing output, pushed the HCOB composite PMI to 52.0 \u2014 the highest in 16 months. Despite the growth, new business continued to shrink in both sectors, and employment in services fell for the second consecutive month, marking the steepest decline in over five years. The drop is attributed to weak demand and reduced backlogs, though it may not indicate widespread job cuts. Ongoing debates around AI\u2019s impact on employment are also a factor to watch. Nonetheless, service providers remain optimistic, with business expectations at their highest since May 2024.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1759478944.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/us-services-sector-stalls-new-orders-slow-crawl-employment-weak-2025-10-03/","title":"US services sector stalls as new orders slow to a crawl, employment weak","snippet":"In September 2025, the U.S. services sector experienced a significant slowdown, with the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) falling to 50\u2014the breakeven point\u2014down from 52.0 in August. This stalled growth was largely due to a marked decline in new orders, which dropped sharply to 50.4 from 56.0, reflecting subdued business activity. Employment within the sector also remained weak, with the employment gauge rising slightly to 47.2 but still indicating contraction for the fourth consecutive month. \n\nEconomists attribute the sluggish performance to uncertainties caused by import tariffs, the growing influence of artificial intelligence, and reduced labor supply due to immigration enforcement. The broader labor market has also shown signs of stagnation, with the job openings-to-unemployment ratio narrowing. As a result, expectations have grown that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates again to support employment, following a rate reduction in September. However, lingering inflation pressures from rising service costs, including airfares and hotel prices, could complicate further rate cuts. These developments come against the backdrop of a federal government shutdown that has delayed the official employment report.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1759501236.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ismworld.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-pmi-reports/pmi/september/","title":"September 2025 ISM \u00ae Manufacturing PMI \u00ae Report","snippet":"\u201cThe Manufacturing PMI\u00ae registered 49.1 percent in September, a 0.4-percentage point increase compared to the reading of 48.7 percent recorded in August.

This new price target, the highest among analysts, reflects positive investor sentiment driven by expectations of increased military spending both in the U.S.\u2014with President Trump proposing a $1 trillion fiscal 2026 budget\u2014and in Europe. Key projects such as the B-21 stealth bomber and Sentinel missile system are improving the company\u2019s cash flow outlook. Currently, 52% of analysts rate the stock a Buy, slightly below the 55% average for S&P 500 stocks. Year-to-date, Northrop\u2019s stock is up 32% and trades at 22 times estimated 2026 earnings, a premium above its historical average of 18 times.

Buy the Stock.","snippet":"Dell Technologies is undergoing a major transformation, evolving from a traditional PC maker into a high-growth company centered around artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Its Infrastructure Solutions Group, which includes servers and networking, saw a 44% year-over-year sales increase in Q2, with server and networking sales alone up 69%\u2014driven by booming AI demand. Dell expects over $20 billion in AI server revenue this year and is targeting enterprise clients like Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, which reportedly ordered $5 billion in servers.\n\nBeyond AI, Dell is focusing on its services division and potentially pursuing acquisitions, backed by $8 billion in cash and strong free cash flow. While its $20 billion debt poses a risk, CEO Michael Dell\u2019s ability to raise capital is noted as a strength. The PC segment, though under pressure, is expected to grow 3% next year due to hardware upgrade cycles for AI use.\n\nForecasts suggest 9% revenue growth in 2026 to $116.6 billion, with EPS projected to rise 18%. Dell trades at a low 14.5x forward earnings, making its stock seem undervalued given high AI-related growth potential. Risks include strong competition and acquisition execution, but the mid-market enterprise segment provides a promising path ahead.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1760011200.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/utilities-safety-strong-growth-prospects-ai-data-centers-9ede0b37","title":"Utilities Aren't Just for Safety Anymore.

The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF has risen by 20% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 15% gain. This shift is driven by soaring energy demand from AI data centers, electric vehicles, and clean energy infrastructure. Companies like Constellation Energy, Vistra, Dominion Energy, and PG&E are providing essential power to tech giants, such as Microsoft, boosting the utility sector\u2019s linkage to the AI boom.\n\nDespite broader market fluctuations, utilities have shown resilience\u2014on S&P 500 down days, they fell just 0.26% on average, and even posted gains a significant 35 times. The sector trades at a discount compared to the S&P 500 but is expected to deliver nearly 9% annual earnings growth over the next two years, more than double its past-decade average.\n\nAmerican Electric Power (AEP) stands out, especially with its exposure to data center hubs in Texas, Virginia, and Ohio. Analysts predict nearly 6% annual revenue growth for AEP through 2028, with corresponding EPS increases and a solid 3.2% dividend yield. AEP offers a compelling mix of safety and promising returns.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1759986000.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"fred.stlouisfed.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2","title":"ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread - FRED","snippet":"ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread (BAMLH0A0HYM2).

This growing premium reflects heightened investor demand for compensation to hold long-term government debt amid increasing fiscal uncertainty. Previously near zero in late 2024, the spread has surged due to recent policy developments, including the White House's push for $5 trillion in tax cuts coupled with rising tariffs, without corresponding cuts in federal spending. The U.S. has already run a fiscal deficit exceeding $1.3 trillion in the first half of the fiscal year. This borrowing surge has eroded investor confidence, especially among foreign central banks, who have favored short-term over long-term U.S. debt for four consecutive months through February. Analysts caution that while a recession could reduce bond yields by driving demand for safe assets, the overall effect on government finances would be negative due to reduced tax revenues and elevated welfare costs, worsening the deficit. Thus, a recession is not a viable solution for improving fiscal sustainability.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1744919220.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/treasury-bond-auction-today-922d2e3e","title":"Bond Market Calms as 10-Year Treasury Auction Sees 'Very Strong' Demand","snippet":"On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury's auction of 10-year bonds met robust demand, calming concerns about weakening interest in U.S. debt. The bonds were sold at a yield of 4.435%, slightly below the pre-auction market rate of 4.465%, indicating a \u201cstop through\u201d and a strong outcome. Notably, indirect bidders\u2014which often include foreign central banks\u2014purchased a significant 87.9% of the supply, well above the 70% average. However, direct demand, primarily from U.S. pension funds, was unusually low at 1.4%. Despite recent months of foreign selling of long-term Treasuries, including leadership from Canada in January, the auction suggests overseas interest remains robust. This comes amid volatile bond market movements and rising yields, with the 30-year Treasury yield experiencing its sharpest three-day increase since 1982. Additionally, President Trump reversed a trade policy stance during the auction, announcing a 90-day delay on tariffs for all countries but China, which will face a rate hike to 125%. The Treasury plans to auction $22 billion in 30-year bonds next, amid concerns that continued market stress could challenge future debt sales. Domestic investors also contribute significantly to selling activity, given their majority ownership of U.S. Treasuries.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1744227780.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/us-treasury-yield-forecasts-anchored-despite-rising-debt-load-inflation-concerns-2025-07-15/","title":"US Treasury yield forecasts anchored despite rising debt load and inflation concerns: Reuters poll","snippet":"A Reuters poll conducted between July 10-15, 2025, found that U.S. Treasury yields are expected to remain within a narrow range in the coming months despite rising debt levels and inflation concerns. The recently passed tax-cut and spending legislation, endorsed by President Donald Trump, is projected to add $3.4 trillion to the U.S. debt, raising it to $36.2 trillion. Simultaneously, threats of impending tariffs from Trump\u2019s administration may fuel inflation, increasing the term premium on long-term bonds. Nearly 77% of surveyed bond strategists anticipate weaker demand for U.S. Treasuries amid substantial net issuance expected at nearly $500 billion this quarter. Although interest rates may trend slightly upward due to increasing risk premiums, expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts anchor projections for the 10-year Treasury yield to hover around 4.42%, possibly declining to 4.30% by year-end. The 2-year yield is forecast to fall to 3.63%, potentially steepening the yield curve. Economists warn that heightened inflation, spurred by tariffs, could dampen consumer spending and restrict Fed policy maneuverability, further straining relations between the Trump administration and Fed Chair Jerome Powell.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1752580410.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68e7ca1708cc832cacbfdd173bcc1e81","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for ACM term premium and yield curve data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98bea3844a316bb2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"7be9f4c8-9ea0-46c0-acfe-b3878a8abb07","turn_exchange_id":"d24659b9-0421-4110-a17d-960cfde3bfb6","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7be9f4c8-9ea0-46c0-acfe-b3878a8abb07","children":["eb5cdd47-2355-4269-9faf-6334573d48c5"]},"fe7670f6-cfc6-42be-975f-d8aede67a2a4":{"id":"fe7670f6-cfc6-42be-975f-d8aede67a2a4","message":{"id":"fe7670f6-cfc6-42be-975f-d8aede67a2a4","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1760021407.4270582,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_model_queries":{"type":"search_model_queries","queries":["US federal budget deficit 2025 fiscal year CBO update","Treasury borrowing estimates 2025 Q4 TBAC refunding statement October 2025"]},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching fiscal deficit and Treasury supply data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98beadab38706bb2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"2a4c217d-a374-45a6-aae4-69e2df0a0b95","turn_exchange_id":"7a9b1cd0-6e47-4e86-9c6c-9c35c73b5f91","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2a4c217d-a374-45a6-aae4-69e2df0a0b95","children":["dbcd154d-5514-4a24-934f-66f59ae03138"]},"eb5cdd47-2355-4269-9faf-6334573d48c5":{"id":"eb5cdd47-2355-4269-9faf-6334573d48c5","message":{"id":"eb5cdd47-2355-4269-9faf-6334573d48c5","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760021074.480819,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into AI and capital expenditure","content":"I\u2019m looking for capital expenditure numbers related to AI for 2025-2026, including guidance from companies like Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon.

And DOGE Didn't Do Much.","snippet":"In fiscal year 2025, despite a major increase in tariff revenues under President Trump\u2019s administration, the U.S. federal deficit remained unchanged at $1.8 trillion, due largely to rising costs in social programs like Social Security and Medicare, and a record-high $1.029 trillion in interest payments on the national debt. Tariffs generated $195 billion\u2014more than double the previous year\u2014though they still comprise only 3.7% of total revenue. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) fell short of its ambitious $2 trillion savings goal, with limited immediate spending cuts. Total spending, excluding interest, increased by $220 billion or 4%, though a one-time $131 billion student-loan adjustment momentarily restrained growth. Meanwhile, costs for entitlement programs continued to climb due to demographic shifts and policy changes. Despite an expanding economy, deficits have not decreased, and public debt is nearing 100% of GDP, with projections showing it may surpass World War II-era highs. Trump's mixed policy approach has included tax cuts and spending increases, offset in part by tariff revenues and selective program adjustments.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1760014800.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"home.treasury.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financing-the-government/quarterly-refunding/most-recent-quarterly-refunding-documents","title":"Most Recent Quarterly Refunding Documents","snippet":"Most Recent Quarterly Refunding Documents.

This includes a $3.3 trillion decrease in primary deficits and $0.7 trillion in reduced federal interest payments. These gains could offset the $3.4 trillion deficit increase caused by this year\u2019s Republican-backed tax-cut and spending bill. The projections reflect Trump's continued tariff hikes, though current rates may change pending international negotiations and legal challenges. As of August, the average U.S. tariff rate had risen to 16.7%, up from 15.1% in June, with over $26 billion in duties collected in the current fiscal year. The U.S. federal debt stands at $37.18 trillion, with Congress facing a looming funding deadline in September to avoid a government shutdown. The August estimate marks an increase from CBO\u2019s June forecast, which predicted a $2.5 trillion deficit reduction and $500 billion in interest savings.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1755882550.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.cbo.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbo.gov/","title":"Congressional Budget Office","snippet":"The federal budget deficit was $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2025, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, $8 billion less than the shortfall recorded ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":13},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.cbo.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbo.gov/topics/budget/outlook-budget-and-economy","title":"Outlook for the Budget and the Economy","snippet":"In CBO's projections, federal budget deficits total $20 trillion over the 2025\u20132034 period and federal debt held by the public reaches 116 percent of GDP.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":17},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.cbo.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"fiscaldata.treasury.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-deficit/","title":"National Deficit | U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data","snippet":"The federal government has spent $1.97 trillion more than it has collected in fiscal year (FY) 2025, resulting in a national deficit. $. 1. 1 . 9. 9. 7. 7. $1.9 ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fiscaldata.treasury.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bloomberg.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-30/us-still-sees-holding-long-term-debt-sales-steady-well-into-2025","title":"US Sees Holding Long-Term Debt Sales Steady Well Into ...","snippet":"Oct 30, 2024 \u2014 Treasury again sees no bump for 'at least' several quarters \u00b7 Quarterly refunding size will be maintained at $125 billion.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.bloomberg.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/26b1fc8a13af4537b72660c4a478dd97","title":"CBO projects US debt to grow $23.9 trillion in 10 years, not including costs of extending tax cuts","snippet":"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the U.S. national debt will increase by $23.9 trillion over the next decade, not accounting for potential extensions of existing tax cuts or new ones proposed by President-elect Donald Trump, which could add over $4 trillion. The CBO report indicates a persistently rising debt due to higher mandatory outlays for Social Security, Medicare, and net interest costs despite slightly higher forecasted taxable incomes. Annual budget deficits are projected to be significantly higher than the historical average, with net interest costs on par with discretionary spending for defense and other programs. CBO Director Phillip Swagel highlights the growing gap between government revenues and expenditures, worsened by an aging population and declining fertility rates. The federal budget deficit is expected to drop slightly this year but will face upward pressure towards the end of the decade. Experts urge lawmakers to consider nonpartisan estimates and avoid budgetary gimmicks while reassessing expiring tax policies.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1737133443.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68e7cb763868832b84e53b524092dcbe","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching fiscal deficit and Treasury supply data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98beadab38706bb2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"fe7670f6-cfc6-42be-975f-d8aede67a2a4","turn_exchange_id":"7a9b1cd0-6e47-4e86-9c6c-9c35c73b5f91","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fe7670f6-cfc6-42be-975f-d8aede67a2a4","children":["60475c36-e657-4d64-b2e5-71b21de51222"]},"439473a9-1b0d-4cad-8b30-b8ce1abff5b1":{"id":"439473a9-1b0d-4cad-8b30-b8ce1abff5b1","message":{"id":"439473a9-1b0d-4cad-8b30-b8ce1abff5b1","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760021078.26548,"update_time":1760021078.384946,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"Microsoft 2025 capex guidance AI data center capex 2025 2026\"}, {\"q\": \"Alphabet capex 2025 AI data center guidance\"}, {\"q\": \"Meta capex 2025 2026 guidance AI infrastructure\"}, {\"q\": \"Amazon AWS capex 2025 guidance generative AI data centers\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"Microsoft 2025 capex guidance AI data center capex 2025 2026"},{"type":"search","q":"Alphabet capex 2025 AI data center guidance"},{"type":"search","q":"Meta capex 2025 2026 guidance AI infrastructure"},{"type":"search","q":"Amazon AWS capex 2025 guidance generative AI data centers"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching for AI capex and hyperscaler guidance","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98bea3844a316bb2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"eb5cdd47-2355-4269-9faf-6334573d48c5","turn_exchange_id":"d24659b9-0421-4110-a17d-960cfde3bfb6","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"eb5cdd47-2355-4269-9faf-6334573d48c5","children":["d7d9b287-6345-4694-b61f-fc261668533e"]},"60475c36-e657-4d64-b2e5-71b21de51222":{"id":"60475c36-e657-4d64-b2e5-71b21de51222","message":{"id":"60475c36-e657-4d64-b2e5-71b21de51222","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760021415.197826,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering global and housing data","content":"I should gather global macro data, like Eurozone PMI, China's growth, and emerging market currency stress, but these aren't a must.

Despite Meta\u2019s progress with its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) chip, the company's massive GPU demands continue to be primarily met by Nvidia, resulting in significant costs. The potential Rivos acquisition, expected to be worth billions, follows Meta\u2019s previously unsuccessful $800 million bid to acquire FuriosaAI. Internally, leadership at Meta has shown frustration over the slow pace of its chip innovation, prompting the push for external solutions. This shift aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s new strategic emphasis on AI over the metaverse, with major investments directed towards infrastructure and talent. While Rivos could offer critical technical expertise, including high-performance custom chips ideal for Meta\u2019s AI workloads, the company has a controversial past, having settled a trade secrets lawsuit with Apple in 2024.

Housing units grew by 16.4%, compared to a 15.5% population increase, helping close a significant gap caused by post-2008 housing crash stagnation. This brief balance was largely driven by a surge in multifamily housing construction between 2022 and 2024. However, this trend is already reversing, as construction has slowed and population growth is expected to surpass housing development again by 2026, according to Mark Stapp of Arizona State University. Despite more housing units, prices may not drop due to persistently high mortgage rates limiting home availability and discouraging sales. The situation is further complicated by stagnant legislative progress, with a potential bipartisan housing bill stalled amid government shutdown distractions. Moreover, affordability remains a major issue nationwide, with one in six potential buyers giving up on finding suitable homes in the last five years.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1760016005.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/49de41ba42bdfe572be3b86caeeb1fcb","title":"Average long-term US mortgage rate ticks up for second straight week, to 6.34%","snippet":"As of early October 2025, the average U.S. 30-year mortgage rate has risen for the second consecutive week, climbing to 6.34% from last week's 6.3%. This marks a modest increase after a previous string of declines that had brought borrowing costs to their lowest in nearly a year. A year ago, this rate stood at 6.12%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as Federal Reserve interest rate policies and investor expectations, typically mirroring the 10-year Treasury yield, which recently fell to 4.10%.\n\nDespite the Fed's rate cut in September\u2014its first in a year\u2014Fed Chair Jerome Powell has suggested a cautious approach going forward, contrasting with some Fed members pushing for more aggressive rate cuts. The housing market, in a slump since 2022, continues to struggle, with home sales this year trailing 2024 levels. The second consecutive rate increase raises concerns about a repeat of last year's post-rate-cut spike in mortgage rates.\n\nRefinancing activity has risen as rates briefly fell, but with 81% of U.S. mortgages currently locked at 6% or lower, broader refinancing appeal depends on rates falling further.

Of the 103 experts surveyed, 58% believe a trigger rate exists, with the majority citing 5.5% or less as the threshold. Despite recent rate declines from peaks above 7%, home sales remain sluggish and are projected to close 2025 at levels comparable to the historic lows of 2023 and 2024. Some economists, like Zillow\u2019s Orphe Divounguy, argue that robust employment and rate stability around 6% could also drive sales.

This momentum is driven by growing investor optimism about AI technology and strong revenue figures from its chip supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted surging demand for their most advanced AI chip, Blackwell, telling CNBC that the world is witnessing the onset of a new industrial revolution powered by AI. Huang also confirmed Nvidia's involvement in funding Elon Musk\u2019s AI startup, xAI.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC reported a 31% year-over-year revenue increase for September, totaling NT$331 billion ($10.9 billion), and a 36% rise in year-to-date revenue compared to 2024. Despite a slight month-to-month dip, experts view TSMC\u2019s performance as evidence of continued strong AI-related demand. TSMC's American depositary receipts dipped slightly after a strong 3.6% gain the previous day.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1760013120.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-power-use-reach-record-highs-2025-2026-eia-says-2025-10-07/","title":"US power use to reach record highs in 2025 and 2026, EIA says","snippet":"According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. power consumption is projected to reach record highs in 2025 and 2026, driven by increased demand from data centers, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency operations, and a shift toward electric heating and transportation.

Despite multiple economic shocks, improved policies, private sector adaptability, and moderated import tariffs have helped major economies, including the U.S., avoid recession. Updated IMF forecasts predict global growth of 3% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, though medium-term growth remains well below pre-pandemic levels of 3.7%.\n\nGeorgieva highlighted rising uncertainty, growing demand for gold as a safe-haven asset, and volatile U.S. trade policies as major concerns. She warned that market valuations resemble those before the dot-com crash and that global public debt could exceed 100% of GDP by 2029.\n\nTo bolster growth and reduce vulnerability, the IMF recommends private-sector productivity reforms, reduced debt, trade liberalization, and financial oversight. Specific regional suggestions include promoting trade in Asia, business reforms in Africa, deeper market integration in Europe, debt reduction in the U.S., and social safety enhancements in China. Overall, Georgieva emphasized that ongoing global uncertainty requires preparedness and structural reforms.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1759939757.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/world-bank-lifts-china-2025-gdp-forecast-48-ahead-slowdown-next-year-2025-10-07/","title":"World Bank lifts China 2025 GDP forecast to 4.8% ahead of a slowdown next year","snippet":"The World Bank has revised its 2025 GDP growth forecast for China upward to 4.8%, up from its earlier 4.0% prediction, citing improved short-term performance. However, it warns of a slowdown in 2026, projecting only 4.2% growth due to shrinking export demand, reduced fiscal stimulus because of rising public debt, and structural economic deceleration. The broader East Asia and Pacific region is expected to grow by 4.4% in 2025, slightly higher than earlier forecasts, though the 2026 projection remains unchanged at 4.5%.\n\nThe report attributes weak economic momentum to global economic policy uncertainty, increasing trade barriers, and political instability in parts of the region like Indonesia and Thailand. These factors have led to low consumer and business confidence and slowed investment. China\u2019s recent data showed weak factory output and retail sales, prompting expectations of additional stimulus measures to meet the government\u2019s \u201caround 5%\u201d growth target. The World Bank also emphasized the importance of long-term structural reforms over short-term fiscal interventions to ensure sustainable growth in the region.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1759821239.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-home-prices-fall-less-than-previously-expected-market-still-weak-2025-09-04/","title":"China's home prices to fall less than previously expected ...","snippet":"Sep 3, 2025 \u2014 Respondents projected a 7.5% fall in property sales in 2025, a sharper contraction than the 5.0% decline predicted in May.

Speaking ahead of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings, Georgieva highlighted ongoing global uncertainty, policy turmoil, and deep social discontent despite overall progress since 30 years ago. This unrest is causing shifts in trade, immigration, and international cooperation.\n\nShe credited better-than-expected performance to improved policymaking in emerging markets, corporate agility, AI adoption, and more favorable U.S. trade conditions. Tariffs have eased, and global retaliation has been limited, helping prevent larger economic fallout. However, she warned that easy financial conditions may be hiding a weakening U.S. economy and increased risks, such as stock market correction and rising global debt, projected to exceed 100% of GDP by 2029.\n\nGeorgieva urged nations to enhance resilience by fostering private-sector productivity, maintaining fair competition, and reforming financial systems. She called for Europe to unify its markets and institutions, the U.S. to address its growing deficit, and China to shift from an export-driven model to one based on domestic consumption and social support. The IMF now forecasts medium-term global growth at around 3%, down from 3.7% pre-pandemic.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1759950120.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.imf.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO","title":"World Economic Outlook - All Issues","snippet":"Global growth is projected at 3.3 percent both in 2025 and 2026, broadly unchanged from the October 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast with an upward ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.imf.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/10/14/world-economic-outlook-october-2025","title":"Coming Soon: World Economic Outlook, October 2025","snippet":"in 5 days \u2014 It presents analyses and projections of the world economy in the near and medium term, which are integral elements of the IMF's surveillance of ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.imf.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/07/29/world-economic-outlook-update-july-2025","title":"World Economic Outlook Update, July 2025: Global Economy","snippet":"2025 \u00b7 Cited by 4 \u2014 Global growth is projected at 3.0 percent for 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, an upward revision from the April 2025 World Economic Outlook.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.imf.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.oecd.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2025/09/oecd-economic-outlook-interim-report-september-2025_ae3d418b.html","title":"OECD Economic Outlook, Interim Report September 2025","snippet":"Sep 23, 2025 \u2014 Global growth was more resilient than anticipated in the first half of 2025, with industrial production and trade supported by front-loading ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.oecd.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/09/global-economic-outlook-weakens-as-policy-uncertainty-weighs-on-demand.html","title":"Global economic outlook weakens as policy uncertainty weighs on demand","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.oecd.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2025/09/oecd-economic-outlook-interim-report-september-2025_ae3d418b/full-report.html","title":"OECD Economic Outlook, Interim Report September 2025","snippet":"Sep 23, 2025 \u2014 Annual GDP growth in the United States is projected to fall from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, as strong investment growth in ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":17},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.oecd.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.news.com.au","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/crisis-grips-china-as-nation-on-brink-of-property-market-death-spiral/news-story/0397ae1fd7b7f4c86b7d64db6f9d6b3e","title":"Crisis grips China as nation on brink of property market ' ...","snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 China's housing market has blown up.

Although Williams acknowledged these risks, he clarified that they do not signal an imminent recession. His remarks support the Federal Reserve's recent decision to lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point in September, aiming to balance inflation control with job market stability.\n\nWilliams emphasized the importance of reducing inflation without aggressively cooling the labor market and underscored the need to protect the Fed's credibility. The Fed's meeting minutes from September 16-17 reflect agreement among officials on the increased labor market risks warranting rate cuts, while still recognizing the challenge of persisting high inflation. The next policy meeting is scheduled for October 28-29, with markets anticipating another quarter-point rate reduction.\n\nWilliams also reaffirmed the importance of the central bank's independence amidst political pressure, referencing President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook and his push for more aggressive rate cuts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1760006342.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/press-releases/us-commercial-real-estate-crisis-office-vacancy-record-highs-2025-08-25/","title":"U.S. Commercial Real Estate Crisis Deepens as Office ...","snippet":"Aug 25, 2025 \u2014 According to recent data from Moody's Analytics, the national office vacancy rate surged to an unprecedented 20.7% in the second quarter , opens ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":13},"pub_date":1756153396.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/wealth/ny-fed-flags-rise-student-loan-borrowing-troubles-second-quarter-2025-08-05/","title":"NY Fed flags rise in student loan borrowing troubles in second quarter","snippet":"In its Q2 2025 Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York highlighted a continued rise in U.S. household debt, increasing by $185 billion (1%) from the previous quarter to a total of $18.39 trillion. Housing-related debt led the increase with a $131 billion rise to $12.94 trillion. Overall delinquency rates also grew slightly, with 4.4% of debt slipping into some level of delinquency.\n\nStudent loan delinquencies climbed significantly following the end of the federal repayment moratorium and resumed reporting to credit agencies. Notably, 10.2% of student loans are now over 90 days delinquent, with Fed researchers anticipating worsening conditions. Total student loan debt stands at $1.64 trillion.\n\nWhile mortgage performance remains historically strong, FHA loans\u2014primarily used by first-time buyers\u2014saw the most considerable rise in delinquencies, particularly in Southern states and Puerto Rico. Credit card debt rose $27 billion to $1.21 trillion, and auto loan debt increased $13 billion to $1.66 trillion, partially due to car purchases made in anticipation of tariffs. The Fed warned that potential declines in home prices could pressure housing-related credit performance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1754409176.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/this-generation-has-the-most-credit-card-debt-at-nearly-usd10000-on-average-how-do-you-compare-11822879","title":"This Generation Has The Most Credit Card Debt at Nearly $10,000 on Average-How Do You Compare?","snippet":"Recent data from Experian highlights a rising concern over credit card debt in the U.S., with Generation X carrying the highest average debt at $9,600\u2014nearly $3,000 more than Millennials and Baby Boomers. Gen X, comprising individuals aged 45 to 60, faces mounting financial pressures as many fall into the \"sandwich generation,\" supporting both aging parents and financially dependent adult children. This dual burden contributes to elevated reliance on credit, compromising their ability to save for retirement.\n\nNationally, the average credit card debt as of June 2025 rose slightly to $6,735. The increase is attributed to persistently high interest rates and rising living costs, which drive more purchases onto credit cards. The financial strain is evident, as nearly 25% of Americans regret overspending on cards, and over 40% express stress over their current debt levels.\n\nExperts recommend proactive debt management strategies like the snowball and avalanche methods to reduce debt. The report emphasizes the importance of using credit responsibly and paying balances promptly to avoid further financial difficulty.

What Could That Mean for Stocks?","snippet":"Goldman Sachs believes Wall Street is underestimating the strength of the U.S. economy and setting earnings expectations too low for the third quarter of 2025. Although analysts predict slower earnings growth for the S&P 500\u20146% versus 11% in Q2\u2014Goldman\u2019s chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, anticipates a positive surprise. This optimism is based on stronger-than-expected sales and continued outperformance from major tech companies known as the \u201cMagnificent 7.\u201d\n\nWhile analysts forecast weaker real sales growth (1% versus 2.5% in Q2), Goldman argues that GDP growth held steady at 2%, suggesting resilience in the broader economy. A stabilizing U.S. dollar may reduce the international sales boost seen earlier, but Kostin expects large-cap tech firms to continue exceeding expectations, just as they did in Q2.\n\nNotably, analyst sentiment has improved, with S&P 500 EPS estimates rising slightly during Q3\u2014the first increase during a quarter since 2021. However, due to minimal change in the macroeconomic outlook and rising tariffs, significant revisions are unlikely this quarter. Although profit margins may remain stable, further expansion is seen as improbable given higher customs duties and limited room for cost-cutting.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1759779665.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.barrons.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/factset-stock-insider-buying-79199dff","title":"FactSet Was Last Quarter's Worst S&P 500 Stock.

This decline was largely triggered by weaker-than-expected earnings reported in early September, despite slightly exceeding revenue expectations. The company also issued a conservative earnings forecast for the fiscal year, attributing it to extended sales cycles and stricter client approval processes, rather than faltering demand or competitive weakness.\n\nDespite the downturn, Chief Legal Officer Christopher McLoughlin showed confidence in FactSet\u2019s future by purchasing 337.62 shares for approximately $100,000 on September 23. These purchases brought his total holdings to 3,445.62 shares, valued at around $973,180 as of the last Friday\u2019s close. Since his purchase, the stock has declined a further 2.1%. McLoughlin, who joined FactSet in December and reports to CEO Sanoke Viswanathan, previously served as general counsel at S&P Global.

This could increase overall S&P 500 operating profit margins by six percentage points and after-tax net income by about 40%. The anticipated value stems from both cost reductions and new revenue streams, despite concerns over potential job losses; historically, productivity gains have led to job creation in other sectors.\n\nBig tech companies\u2014Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon\u2014are projected to ramp up capital expenditures on AI to a combined $340 billion in 2025, a 50% increase from 2024, totaling nearly $1 trillion between 2024 and 2026. Morgan Stanley further estimates that AI\u2019s impact could increase S&P 500 market capitalization by $13 to $16 trillion, representing a 22\u201327% boost.\n\nIn market news, the Dow hit new highs and S&P 500 edged up 0.3% for the week, while Nasdaq dipped 0.6%. Key corporate moves included SoftBank's Intel stake, Meta's AI hiring freeze, and agreements like Nexstar Media\u2019s acquisition of Tegna.

This marks a modest increase after a previous string of declines that had brought borrowing costs to their lowest in nearly a year. A year ago, this rate stood at 6.12%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as Federal Reserve interest rate policies and investor expectations, typically mirroring the 10-year Treasury yield, which recently fell to 4.10%.\n\nDespite the Fed's rate cut in September\u2014its first in a year\u2014Fed Chair Jerome Powell has suggested a cautious approach going forward, contrasting with some Fed members pushing for more aggressive rate cuts. The housing market, in a slump since 2022, continues to struggle, with home sales this year trailing 2024 levels. The second consecutive rate increase raises concerns about a repeat of last year's post-rate-cut spike in mortgage rates.\n\nRefinancing activity has risen as rates briefly fell, but with 81% of U.S. mortgages currently locked at 6% or lower, broader refinancing appeal depends on rates falling further. Meanwhile, 15-year mortgage rates have also risen slightly to 5.55%, up from last week\u2019s 5.49%.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1759421265.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.barrons.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/mortgage-rates-housing-market-sales-economy-fannie-mae-18f4dfe2","title":"This Is the Mortgage Rate Needed to Revitalize the Housing Market","snippet":"A recent Fannie Mae survey reveals that most economists believe a significant drop in mortgage rates to 5.5% or lower is necessary to stimulate U.S. housing market activity. While current 30-year mortgage rates average 6.34%, nearly half of the surveyed economists say a rate of 5.5% or below could jumpstart home sales. Of the 103 experts surveyed, 58% believe a trigger rate exists, with the majority citing 5.5% or less as the threshold. Despite recent rate declines from peaks above 7%, home sales remain sluggish and are projected to close 2025 at levels comparable to the historic lows of 2023 and 2024. Some economists, like Zillow\u2019s Orphe Divounguy, argue that robust employment and rate stability around 6% could also drive sales. Overall, economic uncertainty and affordability issues continue to weigh on the housing market despite modest improvements in mortgage application activity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1759420920.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.kiplinger.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.kiplinger.com/real-estate/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates","title":"Find the Best 30-Year Mortgage Rates Today","snippet":"As of October 2025, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.35%, following a recent 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which now has a target federal funds rate between 4.00% and 4.25%. Although this is the first rate cut in a while, further reductions are anticipated in 2025, which may help stimulate the housing market by encouraging more homeowners to sell. Mortgage rates vary slightly by lender, and even small changes can significantly impact monthly payments and total repayment over the life of a loan. For instance, on a $420,000 home with a 20% down payment, lowering a mortgage rate from 6.35% to 6% can result in nearly $915 in yearly savings.\n\nTo secure a better mortgage rate, borrowers are encouraged to raise their credit scores, increase their down payments, seek quotes from multiple lenders, or consider adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) if they plan to sell their home within a few years. Refinancing may become more attractive as rates continue to decrease. Comparing current offers and following strategic financing practices can potentially save thousands over a 30-year loan.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1759858913.0,"attribution":"www.kiplinger.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"fred.stlouisfed.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA","title":"S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index - FRED","snippet":"Jun 2025: 331.51500 | Index Jan 2000=100, Not Seasonally Adjusted | Monthly.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) reported a slight increase in their optimism index to 91.5 in September, while the uncertainty index hit a record high of 103. Despite improvements like cooling inflation and steady hiring, small businesses face challenges retaining workers and managing costs. Resultantly, owners are less inclined to invest in capital and inventory, with reported inventory gains and capital outlays both decreasing. Job openings remain a concern, though reports of unfilled positions have slightly declined.

The revision significantly reduces the perceived job growth during the final months of President Biden's term and the early weeks of President Trump's second term.\n\nThis substantial adjustment has fueled political tensions. The Trump administration, citing the inaccuracy, has criticized the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), recently dismissing BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and nominating conservative economist E.J. Antoni as her replacement. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer accused the Biden-era BLS leadership of negligence and reliance on outdated methods. The revision may strengthen calls from the White House for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates amid signs of a softening job market.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1757430464.755,"attribution":"www.politico.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68e7cb763868832b84e53b524092dcbe","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Q2 2025 productivity and economic data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98beadab38706bb2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"fce0fbb7-d536-4ecc-9dbc-ad9af537f5df","turn_exchange_id":"7a9b1cd0-6e47-4e86-9c6c-9c35c73b5f91","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fce0fbb7-d536-4ecc-9dbc-ad9af537f5df","children":["7f8ff731-acc7-402b-8cb3-7205cd81de36"]},"c5ac6676-fc60-4188-9137-992261e43d41":{"id":"c5ac6676-fc60-4188-9137-992261e43d41","message":{"id":"c5ac6676-fc60-4188-9137-992261e43d41","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760021128.532218,"update_time":1760021128.541634,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"WTI oil price October 2025 EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook 2025 demand\"}, {\"q\": \"OPEC+ production quotas 2025 extension news October 2025\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"WTI oil price October 2025 EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook 2025 demand"},{"type":"search","q":"OPEC+ production quotas 2025 extension news October 2025"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching oil price forecasts and production quotas","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98bea3844a316bb2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"4857cd5d-8012-4226-b810-04a9bc388b3c","turn_exchange_id":"d24659b9-0421-4110-a17d-960cfde3bfb6","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"4857cd5d-8012-4226-b810-04a9bc388b3c","children":["1be2fb75-a8e1-4b3a-b092-9bc237022668"]},"7f8ff731-acc7-402b-8cb3-7205cd81de36":{"id":"7f8ff731-acc7-402b-8cb3-7205cd81de36","message":{"id":"7f8ff731-acc7-402b-8cb3-7205cd81de36","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760021447.480124,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering supply-side energy","content":"We might want to touch on the supply-side of energy, looking at oil prices, natural gas trends, and the broader commodity market, like the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM).

Brent crude futures fell 0.51% to $65.91 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate declined 0.61% to $62.17. The announcement led to a diminished risk premium in oil markets, with analysts noting that the ceasefire agreement reduced fears of a broader regional conflict disrupting oil supply.\n\nDespite the ceasefire, analysts do not expect immediate changes in oil production from the Middle East, as OPEC+ has not hit its increased production targets. Meanwhile, a strong U.S. dollar has made commodities like oil more expensive for investors using other currencies, further pressuring prices.\n\nU.S. oil consumption rose to its highest levels since December 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration. However, global oil demand at the beginning of October showed signs of slowing, with JP Morgan reporting lower-than-expected activity across several economic indicators, contributing to a slower pace in global inventory builds.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1759983324.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-poised-raise-oil-output-further-sources-say-2025-10-05/","title":"OPEC+ opts for modest oil output hike as glut fears mount","snippet":"4 days ago \u2014 OPEC+ will raise oil output from November by 137000 barrels per day (bpd), it said on Sunday, opting for the same fairly modest monthly ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1759651462.487,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-rises-oversupply-fear-eases-after-opec-restrains-output-increase-2025-10-08/","title":"Oil prices edge up on worries about Russian output, higher ...","snippet":"19 hours ago \u2014 Russian oil production nears OPEC+ quota despite sanctions; Oil markets supported by smaller-than-expected OPEC+ output increase for November.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1759906435.321,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mrt.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mrt.com/business/oil/article/oil-prices-opec-supply-risk-21091324.php","title":"Oil prices steady after slump, but OPEC+ supply puts $50 risk in play","snippet":"Oil prices have stabilized after falling to four-year lows triggered by tariff announcements in April 2025. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that crude oil prices ended Q3 only slightly lower than at the start of the quarter. However, price pressures remain due to increasing OPEC+ production and global trade uncertainties, raising fears of an oversupplied market. Despite this, U.S. crude inventories have stayed closer to their five-year lows.\n\nAnalysts from Morningstar and Rystad Energy highlight ongoing concerns, with Morningstar noting that supply growth and tariffs will weigh on prices, though they revised their 2025 WTI price forecast to $65. Rystad Energy forecasts a bearish trend, warning that additional OPEC+ supply (2.5 million barrels/day) and weak demand could push prices down to or below $50. Increased non-OPEC+ production and Cushing stockpiles add to the downside risks. However, U.S. midcontinent markets could see some support due to tightened supply from Canadian exports rerouted by the new Trans Mountain pipeline. Overall, analysts predict continued crude market surplus and price pressure heading into 2026.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1759959199.0,"attribution":"www.mrt.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.eia.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/","title":"Short-Term Energy Outlook","snippet":"We forecast that the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $62 per barrel (b) in the fourth quarter of 2025 and $52/b in 2026.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.eia.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=66319","title":"Expanding strategic oil stocks in China support crude oil prices","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.eia.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf","title":"Short-Term Energy Outlook","snippet":"7 days ago \u2014 We forecast that the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $62 per barrel (b) in the fourth quarter of 2025 and $52/b in 2026. \u2022 ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1759851606.0,"attribution":"www.eia.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.opec.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.opec.org/pr-detail/243578-05-october-2025.html","title":"Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan ...","snippet":"4 days ago \u2014 The eight OPEC+ countries will hold monthly meetings to review market conditions, conformity, and compensation.

The new guidance reduces copper output for 2025 to 170,000\u2013190,000 metric tons (from 210,000\u2013230,000), and for 2026 to 200,000\u2013235,000 tons (from 280,000\u2013310,000). Production for 2027 and 2028 has also been revised downward. Molybdenum production has nearly halved for 2026. Teck attributed the production cuts primarily to a tailings disposal issue.

This shift is driven by slower production growth due to recent mine disruptions in Indonesia, Chile, and Congo. Consequently, the ICSG has revised its 2025 global mine production growth forecast down from 2.3% to 1.4%. Although mine output growth is expected to improve to 2.3% in 2026 with new capacities and recoveries in major producing countries, refined copper production growth is anticipated to decelerate to 0.9% from 3.4% in 2025, due to limited copper concentrate availability. Meanwhile, global copper usage is projected to grow by 2.1% in 2026, led by Asia despite a slowdown in China, which accounts for 58% of global usage. Demand in Europe and Japan is expected to remain weak. Copper prices have responded by rising to a 16-month high amid concerns over supply shortages.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1759933825.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.eia.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhda.htm","title":"Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price (Dollars per Million Btu)","snippet":"Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price (Dollars per Million Btu).

Despite the U.S. dollar index (DXY) falling 9% in 2025, Englander argues that productivity gains could reverse this trend, with indicators suggesting a 4.5% to 5% annualized rise in Q3. Such a boost traditionally correlates with stronger dollar performance due to improved capital inflows and profitability in corporate America.\n\nEnglander acknowledges risks including government efforts to weaken the dollar and high domestic and external debt burdens. Yet, he highlights that higher productivity should lead to increased demand for capital, raising real interest rates and reducing the incentive for international investors to hedge dollar exposure. This would further support the dollar.\n\nHe cautions that if productivity accelerates while real rates remain low, economic overheating may occur due to inflation or rising imports. While unsure of AI\u2019s exact role in this trend, Englander believes AI likely contributes to productivity advancements, although definitive data is lacking.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1760004300.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/softer-dollar-rbi-muscle-lend-rupee-mild-support-open-2025-10-09/","title":"Rupee's quiet spell extends, courtesy of central bank","snippet":"As of October 9, 2025, the Indian rupee continued its stable trading pattern, showing minimal movement at 88.78 per U.S. dollar. This stability is largely attributed to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) active intervention, particularly its consistent dollar sales aimed at defending the 88.80 level. While other Asian currencies experienced volatility and the dollar index rose due to a weakened Japanese yen, the rupee's reaction remained subdued, highlighting the central bank's strong influence in the foreign exchange market.\n\nMarket observers note that the RBI\u2019s actions have effectively dampened the rupee's sensitivity to regional and global market shifts. Despite firm global dollar trends and foreign equity outflows from India, the RBI\u2019s strategy has prevented further rupee depreciation. Meanwhile, strong dollar demand persists from importers like oil firms, but exporter dollar sales are limited, contributing to pressures the RBI is managing carefully. Traders view the RBI as favoring a slow, controlled depreciation rather than abrupt currency weakening.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1759990340.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-vaults-over-4000-rush-safety-fed-easing-bets-2025-10-08/","title":"Gold shatters $4,000 milestone, silver belts record high as investors rush to safety","snippet":"Gold surged past $4,000 per ounce for the first time on October 8, 2025, reaching $4,050.24 in the spot market and $4,070.5 in futures, supported by geopolitical and economic uncertainty, strong investor demand for safe-haven assets, and anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts. Silver also hit a record high of $49.57, up 71% year-to-date, driven by similar safe-haven demand, tight market conditions, and strong ETF inflows. Gold has risen 54% in 2025, outperforming equities, bitcoin, and commodities like crude oil. Analysts say ongoing global conflicts, political instability in countries like France and Japan, and a weakening U.S. dollar are further fueling safe-haven interest. Central bank buying and a \"fear of missing out\" are adding to the metals' momentum. HSBC raised its silver price forecasts due to strong gold prices and renewed investor interest, while other precious metals like platinum and palladium also saw sharp gains. The rally is expected to continue into 2026, with potential for gold to approach $5,000 per ounce.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1759947433.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/dollar-faces-prolonged-weakness-amid-fed-rate-cuts-2025-10-01/","title":"Dollar faces prolonged weakness amid Fed rate cuts","snippet":"Oct 1, 2025 \u2014 \"The dollar can weaken further over the next six to 12 months as the Fed continues to cut rates while other major central banks like the ECB ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1759329171.617,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yen-trims-weekly-advance-investors-weigh-boj-election-impacts-2025-10-03/","title":"US dollar posts multi-week losses on fears of prolonged ...","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Gains in the euro pushed the dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of key currencies, 0.1% lower at 97.69.

This decision came amid weakening labor market indicators and increased pressure from President Donald Trump for looser monetary policy. However, meeting minutes revealed internal divisions, with some officials preferring to hold rates steady due to concerns about persistent inflation. Inflation, as measured by the Fed\u2019s preferred index, rose to 2.7% in August, slightly above the July level, stalling progress toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Some policymakers feared that prolonged inflation could raise long-term expectations. Although 11 of the 12 voting FOMC members supported the rate cut, Stephen Miran, recently appointed and aligned with Trump, advocated for a larger cut. Miran also predicted deeper rate reductions than the majority. The committee remains cautious, balancing inflation concerns against signs of a softening labor market. Meanwhile, Trump continues efforts to influence Fed policy, including a failed attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1759948665.969,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/da274909e44aed4ac4c78625db587026","title":"Fed minutes: Most officials supported further rate cuts as worries about jobs rose","snippet":"At its Sept. 16-17, 2025 meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point to about 4.1%, marking the first reduction of the year. This move was supported by most members of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee due to increased concerns about rising unemployment, while inflation risks were viewed as diminished or stable. However, the minutes revealed internal division, with some officials favoring keeping rates unchanged or advocating for more significant cuts.\n\nStephen Miran, recently appointed by former President Donald Trump, dissented in favor of a larger half-point cut, arguing that inflation will fall due to declining rental costs and tariff-related fiscal improvements. Conversely, others, including Jeffrey Schmid of the Kansas City Fed and Austan Goolsbee of the Chicago Fed, cautioned against aggressive cuts, emphasizing the ongoing threat of high inflation.\n\nThe minutes shed light on the committee\u2019s deliberations, though future decision-making could be complicated by a federal government shutdown, which has already delayed key economic reports like employment and inflation data. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the uncertainty, calling the policy path forward unclear and risk-laden.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1759946869.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/most-fed-officials-backed-more-interest-rate-cuts-this-year-minutes-show-adc5e564","title":"'Most' Fed officials backed lower interest rates this year. Here's what they said at their big meeting.","snippet":"At the September 16-17, 2025 Federal Reserve meeting, most officials signaled support for cutting interest rates further this year amid a weakening labor market and stabilizing inflation outlook. Concerns about rising unemployment prompted many Fed leaders to consider additional policy easing. Although the number of planned cuts wasn't specified, the Fed's \"dot plot\" suggested a slight majority favoring two rate reductions this year. The Fed had already cut rates by 25 basis points at the September meeting, with an 11-1 vote; dissent came from Stephen Miran, a Trump appointee, who preferred a larger cut. A few officials opposed further cuts due to stalled progress on lowering inflation.\n\nUncertainty has increased due to a government shutdown, which delayed key economic data like the September jobs report, and may affect upcoming inflation data. The Fed now faces the dual challenge of supporting the labor market without reigniting inflation, while markets overwhelmingly expect another rate cut soon, with traders placing a 96% probability on a move this month.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1759947780.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fed-is-divided-on-how-fast-to-cut-rates-the-recap-of-its-last-big-meeting-may-give-us-the-inside-scoop-d095b766?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgm1SlrU7ciGEGfO_cCN05dtxOnwooCMm684DfaQV0FwNTXpxjYZg_I&gaa_sig=1pA7odvKv7nk3jS1C2f4rOaNH1k6qlM6hQ1ccLgaBGPqad0AUSxfFC4t5E-77iGxI6nwJdbsidjIoz7dJj2AWQ%3D%3D&gaa_ts=68e7cf5d","title":"The Fed is divided on how fast to cut rates.

Despite being the third-highest on record for September, ports processed 2.31 million TEUs. The decline is linked to retailers frontloading goods ahead of tariff hikes, especially for holiday merchandise, which is expected to reduce volumes below 2 million TEUs for the remainder of the year.\n\nNew tariffs, including a 25% duty on upholstered furniture, cabinets, and vanities, are scheduled to be implemented soon, with a delayed Chinese tariff increase slated for November 10 unless postponed again. These policy changes have contributed to increased economic uncertainty, as emphasized by Hackett Associates. China's share of U.S. imports fell from 34.5% in August to 33% in September, with notable drops in aluminum, footwear, and electric machinery. Meanwhile, U.S. imports from countries like Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and India saw growth, although overall Asian trade showed signs of slowing. Despite the tariff pressure, year-to-date imports were still up 1.9% compared to 2024.","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1760001168.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-says-25-tariff-medium-heavy-duty-trucks-start-nov-1-2025-10-06/","title":"Trump imposing new 25% large truck tariff starting Nov. 1","snippet":"Beginning November 1, 2025, President Donald Trump will impose a 25% tariff on all imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks in a significant move to bolster U.S. manufacturers against foreign competition. The policy shift extends his prior announcement suggesting national security concerns as justification. Domestic companies such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, and Freightliner are expected to benefit. While existing trade agreements with Japan and the EU establish 15% tariffs on light-duty vehicles, the applicability to heavier vehicles remains uncertain.\n\nMexico, the largest source of U.S. heavy truck imports\u2014with shipments tripling since 2019 to about 340,000\u2014strongly opposes the tariffs, noting that their exported trucks contain roughly 50% U.S. content. According to the USMCA, trucks with at least 64% North American content currently enter tariff-free. Companies like Stellantis and Volvo, which have major manufacturing operations or future plans in Mexico, may be significantly affected. Despite lobbying efforts, including from Stellantis, the tariffs will proceed. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also expressed concern, emphasizing that major truck importers are allied nations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1759782321.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/wto-downgrades-global-trade-growth-forecast-05-next-year-2025-10-07/","title":"WTO downgrades global trade growth forecast to 0.5% for next year","snippet":"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has significantly downgraded its forecast for global merchandise trade volume growth in 2026 to just 0.5%, down from the previous estimate of 1.8%. This revision is largely due to the anticipated delayed impact of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have created global economic uncertainty and disrupted trade relations. Despite the gloomy outlook for 2026, the WTO upgraded its 2025 forecast to 2.4% from 0.9%, attributing the improvement to a surge in imports into the United States ahead of tariff hikes and strong demand for AI-related goods.\n\nWTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged concerns about the future but emphasized the resilience of the multilateral rules-based trading system. In 2025, overall global trade grew in both volume (4.9% year-on-year) and value (6%), with trade in AI-related technologies, such as semiconductors and telecom equipment, leading the expansion. Growth was particularly strong in Asia and Africa.\n\nHowever, the WTO expects all regions to face weaker import growth in 2026, and global GDP growth is also forecast to decline slightly from 2.7% in 2025 to 2.6% in 2026.","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1759846385.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-trade-war-tariff-deadlines-key-upcoming-events-2025-10-03/","title":"Trump's trade war: Tariff deadlines and key upcoming events","snippet":"2 days ago \u2014 The latest round of levies includes a 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical imports and a 25% duty on heavy-duty trucks, as Trump ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1748618964.447,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-says-us-will-impose-25-tariff-heavy-trucks-imports-october-1-2025-09-25/","title":"Trump slaps steep US tariffs on drugs, heavy trucks and ...","snippet":"Sep 26, 2025 \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled sweeping new import tariffs, including 100% duties on patented drugs and 25% levies on ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1758841459.947,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-hits-dozens-more-countries-with-steep-tariffs-2025-07-31/","title":"Trump hits dozens more countries with steep tariffs","snippet":"Aug 1, 2025 \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on exports from dozens of trading partners, including Canada, Brazil, India and Taiwan, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1753983933.878,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-stokes-trade-war-world-reels-tariff-shock-2025-04-03/","title":"Trump tariffs sow fears of trade wars, recession and a ...","snippet":"Apr 4, 2025 \u2014 Economists say the tariffs could reignite inflation, raise the risk of a U.S. recession and boost costs for the average U.S. family by thousands ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":1743670775.13,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-donald-trumps-tariff-threats-2025-01-28/","title":"Trump's tariffs and threatened trade actions","snippet":"Jun 4, 2025 \u2014 The United States doubled tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Wednesday, activating a hike in the duties on the imported metals to 50% from the 25% rate ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},"pub_date":1738093623.811,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tradecomplianceresourcehub.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tradecomplianceresourcehub.com/2025/10/06/trump-2-0-tariff-tracker/","title":"Trump 2.0 tariff tracker","snippet":"3 days ago \u2014 ... 10% baseline reciprocal tariff.

Annually, PCE inflation increased to 2.7%, while core inflation\u2014excluding food and energy\u2014remained steady at 2.9%. These figures match the Federal Reserve's closely watched indicators for inflation, which influence monetary policy and interest rate decisions.\n\nMarket reactions were modestly positive: stock futures rose, Treasury yields fell slightly, and the U.S. dollar weakened. Analysts interpreted the numbers as stable inflation amid stronger-than-expected consumer spending, suggesting a still-resilient economy. Doug Beath of Wells Fargo noted the results support ongoing market confidence, while Gennadiy Goldberg of TD Securities emphasized consumer strength and stable inflation. Peter Cardillo from Spartan Capital stated that inflation remains sticky but not escalating, potentially supporting one more Fed rate cut this year. Meanwhile, Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital pointed to the labor market as a key factor for the Fed\u2019s next move. Overall, the data suggest a balanced economic outlook with moderate inflation and sustained consumer activity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1758892636.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.morningstar.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.morningstar.com/economy/august-pce-report-pce-inflation-index-up-27-line-with-expectations","title":"August PCE Report: PCE Inflation Index Up 2.7%, in Line ...","snippet":"Sep 26, 2025 \u2014 Core PCE rose 2.9% year over year in August, below forecasts for a 3.0% increase and following an increase of the same amount in July.

Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.9%, matching July\u2019s figure and meeting expectations. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3%, while core prices were up 0.2%.\n\nConsumer spending, adjusted for inflation, increased by 0.4%, with a notable 0.7% rise in goods consumption and a modest 0.2% increase in services. Income growth also remained steady at 0.4%, with self-employed and business income climbing 0.9%, and wages rising 0.3%, slightly slower than July\u2019s 0.5%.\n\nDespite earlier aggressive rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to combat inflation, price increases remain above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The Fed responded by cutting rates for the first time in 2025 due to a weakening job market.

The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, rose to 2.7% annually, up from 2.6% in July. Core PCE, excluding food and energy, held steady at 2.9%, remaining above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Nonetheless, consumer spending grew by 0.6%, outpacing July\u2019s 0.5% and expectations.\n\nThe inflation report came shortly after the Fed implemented its first interest rate cut since December 2024, lowering rates to 4-4.25%. Market expectations now lean toward another rate cut in October. Despite high inflation and tariffs from President Trump, the economy showed strength; second-quarter GDP growth was revised up sharply to 3.8%, driven by a significant increase in consumer spending.\n\nOther indicators were mixed: retail sales were strong, personal income rose 0.4%, but hiring slowed. Jobless claims, however, dropped to 218,000, alleviating labor market concerns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the economy's resilience amid policy shifts and kept the door open for further rate cuts while signaling a cautious approach.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1758891879.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68e7cb763868832b84e53b524092dcbe","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for US PCE inflation data, August 2025","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98beadab38706bb2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"580a5ea4-8faf-4287-9d93-3fdc7ff2e59b","turn_exchange_id":"7a9b1cd0-6e47-4e86-9c6c-9c35c73b5f91","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"580a5ea4-8faf-4287-9d93-3fdc7ff2e59b","children":["bebfc4a1-47f0-4f4a-84f9-6f35223e9ebf"]},"8e0e7445-b72f-484c-84cd-d55323f7d90c":{"id":"8e0e7445-b72f-484c-84cd-d55323f7d90c","message":{"id":"8e0e7445-b72f-484c-84cd-d55323f7d90c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760021178.774473,"update_time":1760021178.782879,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"finance\": [{\"ticker\": \"SPY\", \"type\": \"fund\", \"market\": \"USA\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Crafting forecasts, sector tilts, and trade strategies","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98bea3844a316bb2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"060ccdcc-ca96-4ae7-80bd-598a4a4b2f3c","turn_exchange_id":"d24659b9-0421-4110-a17d-960cfde3bfb6","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"060ccdcc-ca96-4ae7-80bd-598a4a4b2f3c","children":["c9bcf2ee-4215-4808-b008-92b05bd7c1af"]},"bebfc4a1-47f0-4f4a-84f9-6f35223e9ebf":{"id":"bebfc4a1-47f0-4f4a-84f9-6f35223e9ebf","message":{"id":"bebfc4a1-47f0-4f4a-84f9-6f35223e9ebf","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760021484.670295,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Confirming US trade policy changes","content":"We need to examine the new US trade policy around tariffs, specifically the possible elimination of the \"de minimis\" exemption.

Ending on August 29, this exemption had facilitated a surge in direct-to-consumer e-commerce, particularly from Chinese firms like Shein and Temu. Wyden expressed concern over the administration's lack of preparedness, citing major disruptions in international mail shipments, confusion, and increased costs for small businesses and consumers. He demanded clarification from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on the adequacy of customs systems to manage the change. According to UN postal data, international shipments fell by 81% immediately after the policy shift. While the exemption was known to be exploited for illicit shipments, Wyden argued the sudden rollback without proper infrastructure was poorly handled.

The change, enacted by President Trump's executive order, aims to close loopholes related to tariff evasion and drug trafficking. As a result, global postal and shipping services are adjusting their operations, with many suspending certain shipments to the U.S. while adapting to new customs regulations. Companies have a six-month transition period with the option to pay a flat duty per package.\n\nDHL, Japan Post, Australia Post, and several European postal services including Posten Bring (Norway), PostNord (Sweden and Denmark), La Poste (France), and Austrian Post have all implemented temporary restrictions or suspensions on U.S.-bound parcels. Most cite the complexity and ambiguity of the new requirements as the primary challenge. Certain services, such as express or gift parcels under $100, remain operational in some cases. Concerns have also been raised about the impact on small exporters, such as Australian businesses now facing tariffs on goods like sustainable clothing and cosmetics.","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1756476364.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.whitehouse.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/suspending-duty-free-de-minimis-treatment-for-all-countries/","title":"Suspending Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment for All ...","snippet":"Jul 30, 2025 \u2014 Independently, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to suspend duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) for ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1753905649.0,"attribution":"www.whitehouse.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-closes-de-minimis-exemptions-to-combat-chinas-role-in-americas-synthetic-opioid-crisis/","title":"Fact Sheet: President Donald J.

Spot gold recently traded at about $3,960 per ounce, having reached a high of $3,977.19 earlier. The metal has surged 51% in 2025, bolstered by central bank buying, increased interest in gold-backed ETFs, a weakening U.S. dollar, and heightened demand from retail investors amid global trade and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nGoldman anticipates central banks\u2014particularly in emerging markets\u2014will continue diversifying into gold, with expected average purchases of 80 metric tons in 2025 and 70 tons in 2026. The bank also foresees an increase in Western ETF holdings, likely influenced by a projected 100 basis point reduction in the U.S. Federal Reserve's funds rate by mid-2026.

A stabilizing U.S. dollar may reduce the international sales boost seen earlier, but Kostin expects large-cap tech firms to continue exceeding expectations, just as they did in Q2.\n\nNotably, analyst sentiment has improved, with S&P 500 EPS estimates rising slightly during Q3\u2014the first increase during a quarter since 2021.

The Fed acknowledged persistent inflation, especially in core goods due to tariffs, even as services inflation appears more stable. The minutes revealed policymakers are open to further interest rate cuts, especially as labor market data shows signs of weakening. The Fed aims to reduce inflation to its 2% target by 2027, though most officials noted upside risks such as the potential persistence of elevated inflation even after tariff effects fade.\n\nThe 2-year Treasury yield slightly rose to 3.581%, though it has dropped significantly over the year. The 10-year yield remained relatively flat at 4.128%, with expectations it may stay between 4% and 4.5%. Investors are increasingly turning to inflation-protected securities like the Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF, which has returned 7.1% year-to-date and seen $2 billion in inflows. Analysts from firms like BlackRock and L&G Asset Management underscored the importance of balancing inflation control with labor market conditions, anticipating that the Fed may cut rates again in upcoming meetings due to economic softness.","ref_id":{"turn_index":17,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":15},"pub_date":1759963800.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"fred.stlouisfed.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIE","title":"10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T10YIE) - FRED","snippet":"The breakeven inflation rate represents a measure of expected inflation derived from 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Securities.","ref_id":{"turn_index":17,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIEM","title":"10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T10YIEM) - FRED","snippet":"10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T10YIEM) ; Sep 2025: 2.37 ; Aug 2025: 2.38 ; Jul 2025: 2.38 ; Jun 2025: 2.30 ; May 2025: 2.31.","ref_id":{"turn_index":17,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1uEEc","title":"10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate | FRED | St. Louis Fed","snippet":"Graph and download economic data for 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate from 2003-01-02 to 2025-10-07 about spread, 10-year, interest rate, interest, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":17,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"ycharts.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ycharts.com/indicators/10_year_tipstreasury_breakeven_rate","title":"10 Year TIPS/Treasury Breakeven Rate (Market Daily)","snippet":"Date, Value.

The median interest rate outlook for 2025 and 2026 increased to 2.9% and 3.1%, respectively, and the long-term rate was raised to 2.6%, hinting at a higher neutral real rate (R-star) of 0.6%. Despite these modest changes, the shifts suggest the Fed anticipates higher rates to curb inflation in the post-pandemic economy, which is less responsive to rate increments. Markets currently predict a higher terminal rate (3.7% by end-2026) than the Fed\u2019s projections, indicating possible future adjustments in policy rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell called these changes \"modest,\" acknowledging the persistent uncertainties affecting long-term rates. He suggested that pre-pandemic low rate levels may not return, aligning with market signals. As inflation remains sticky, the Fed might adjust its rate views upward, closer to market expectations, to prevent unintended price instability.","ref_id":{"turn_index":17,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1711020602.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/800198bf-afc6-4bf3-9053-81c0e07cc50a","title":"BoE governor expects four UK rate cuts next year as inflation eases","snippet":"The Bank of England (BoE) Governor, Andrew Bailey, announced that the BoE anticipates four interest rate cuts in the next year if current economic forecasts hold true. This expectation arises as the UK experiences a quicker-than-expected decline in inflation. Despite recent rate cuts, the BoE remains cautious due to persistent services inflation. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicts that UK rates will plateau at 3.5% by 2026, slightly above US and European rates due to stronger domestic demand and fiscal stimulus. The OECD forecasts UK economic growth at 1.7% in 2025 and continued inflationary pressures. The BoE's projections align with market expectations for a gradual reduction in rates, considering various inflation scenarios. The current slowdown in inflation suggests effective inflation-targeting by the BoE, although fiscal prudence remains crucial given high public debt.","ref_id":{"turn_index":17,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1733302859.787,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68e7cb763868832b84e53b524092dcbe","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for 10-year breakeven inflation rate","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98beadab38706bb2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"f0dd5351-46ec-4378-951d-34b5c195de33","turn_exchange_id":"7a9b1cd0-6e47-4e86-9c6c-9c35c73b5f91","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f0dd5351-46ec-4378-951d-34b5c195de33","children":["86afce14-57b0-4df0-887a-2729b04f57ed"]},"86afce14-57b0-4df0-887a-2729b04f57ed":{"id":"86afce14-57b0-4df0-887a-2729b04f57ed","message":{"id":"86afce14-57b0-4df0-887a-2729b04f57ed","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760021605.269704,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating risk premiums","content":"I can calculate a risk premium by comparing forward earnings yield and real yields.

Originally, the IRS continued limited operations funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, but wider closures are now underway. This comes amid ongoing failure by President Donald Trump and Congress to reach a funding agreement.\n\nDoreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, warned that the furloughs will significantly impact taxpayers, leading to delays in assistance, backlogs, and disruptions as people prepare to file tax extension returns. Despite earlier warnings from the Trump administration about uncertain back pay, the agency confirmed employees would be compensated retroactively once the shutdown ends. \n\nThe IRS, like many federal agencies, has struggled with staffing issues this year\u2014its workforce has dropped from 100,000 at the end of 2024 to around 75,000 due to layoffs driven by a Department of Government Efficiency initiative.

This move will leave only 53.6% of IRS staff, around 39,870 workers, continuing operations and significantly disrupt taxpayer assistance services. In its statement, the IRS cited the lapse in government appropriations as the reason for the furloughs. Furloughed employees will be placed in non-pay and non-duty status but must report briefly to prepare for furlough. \n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union criticized the decision, warning of increased wait times, service delays, and difficulty for taxpayers, particularly with extension return filings due soon. The decision follows a White House memo suggesting that furloughed employees might not receive back pay, despite the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, which mandates compensation after shutdowns.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reports issues at major airports, including Nashville, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, and Philadelphia, along with key air traffic control centers. Union leaders warn that the situation could further deteriorate, potentially affecting holiday travel. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers are working without pay, leading to increased stress and sick calls and causing delays of over 6,000 flights in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Denver.\n\nDespite these issues, about 92% of scheduled flights remained on time. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association emphasized that coordinated work actions remain illegal and discouraged. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and union leaders blame the shutdown's impact on safety and outdated infrastructure. President Trump has suggested that not all furloughed workers may receive back pay. Over 11,000 FAA workers have been furloughed, and existing staffing shortages are now being exacerbated, especially at smaller airports. Pressure is mounting on Congress to reach a bipartisan agreement to reopen the government.","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1759940097.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/upcoming-deadlines-us-government-shutdown-2025-10-08/","title":"Upcoming deadlines in the US government shutdown","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1759943401.436,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/air-travelers-rethink-plans-us-government-shutdown-causes-flight-delays-2025-10-09/","title":"Air travelers rethink plans as US government shutdown causes flight delays, cancellations","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1760004157.73,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/longest-us-government-shutdowns-2025-10-01/","title":"When were the longest US government shutdowns","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6},"pub_date":1759345412.453,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/jobs-day-data-fix-us-shutdown-here-is-what-experts-are-saying-2025-10-03/","title":"For a jobs day data fix in a US shutdown, here is what the experts are saying","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":1759515901.672,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-how-it-affects-key-economic-data-publishing-2025-10-06/","title":"US government shutdown: How it affects key economic ...","snippet":"3 days ago \u2014 The closure has shut off the flow of key economic data at a moment of uncertainty among policymakers and investors about the health of the U.S. ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},"pub_date":1759727070.751,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-begins-shut-down-most-operations-after-congress-fails-advance-2025-10-01/","title":"White House freezes funds for Democratic states in ...","snippet":"7 days ago \u2014 The government shutdown, the 15th since 1981, suspended scientific research, financial oversight, environmental cleanup efforts and a wide range ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},"pub_date":1759291378.236,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-shutdowns-raise-uncertainty-rarely-have-lasting-effect-economy-2025-10-01/","title":"US government shutdowns raise uncertainty but rarely ...","snippet":"7 days ago \u2014 Oct 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. government shutdown has thrown the brakes on the flow of federal economic data at a moment of uncertainty and ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":13},"pub_date":1759347386.418,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-government-shutdown-gives-fed-last-thing-it-needs-even-less-visibility-2025-10-02/","title":"US government shutdown gives Fed last thing it needs","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Key employment and inflation data are set to be delayed, namely weekly jobless claims from the Labor Department, and all-important monthly non- ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},"pub_date":1759410447.108,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-what-is-open-what-is-closed-2025-10-01/","title":"US government shutdown: What is open, what is closed","snippet":"Oct 1, 2025 \u2014 WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. government services will be disrupted until President Donald Trump and Congress agree on a spending deal.","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1759337227.583,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.newsweek.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/top-economist-issues-stark-warning-over-jobs-market-10838657","title":"Top Economist Issues Stark Warning Over Jobs Market","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1759835282.0,"attribution":"www.newsweek.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.opb.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/03/shutdown-delays-jobs-report-and-more-key-data-may-be-held-up/","title":"Shutdown has already delayed the jobs report.

This warning is based on unusually low 30-day price correlations among five major sectors\u2014technology, industrial, consumer discretionary, financial, and healthcare\u2014compared to the broader S&P 500. Such low correlations, below 0.61 and dropping to levels around 0.596\u20130.607 in late September, have historically preceded market declines of 5% to 18% since early 2023. Despite these concerns, DataTrek does not interpret this as a need to sell immediately, citing the difficulty of accurately timing market tops. The firm remains optimistic on U.S. large-cap stocks and suggests the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) could signal buying opportunities if it rises above its long-term average of 19.5. The market remains resilient amid a government shutdown, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all closing at record highs on the day of the report.","ref_id":{"turn_index":19,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1759437180.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-stock-market-is-now-in-a-show-me-phase-as-soft-landing-not-fully-assured-a92b2d9a","title":"Why the stock market is now in a 'show-me phase' as soft landing 'not fully assured'","snippet":"The stock market is in a \"show-me phase\" as a soft landing for the U.S. economy remains uncertain according to Lisa Shalett, CIO of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. With investors anticipating the Federal Reserve to start easing monetary policy and cutting interest rates by September due to reduced inflation, attention is shifting toward whether this will stimulate market sectors dependent on these rates. The equity risk premium has decreased since October 2022 but may be close to its trough, indicating rising risk and limited margins for error in policy execution. Shalett suggests that a gradual rate-cutting cycle could foster impatience and frustration. The Fed's benchmark rate has been held at a range of 5.25% to 5.5% since July last year, and while investors expect the rate to remain unchanged during this week's policy meeting, they anticipate it will decrease later in the year. Market responses observed include a slight rise in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, a flat Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a slight decrease in the small-cap Russell 2000.","ref_id":{"turn_index":19,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1722275100.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.trustnet.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.trustnet.com/news/13459450/fund/sectors","title":"US equities approach dot-com bubble valuations as ...","snippet":"Oct 1, 2025 \u2014 Meanwhile, the equity risk premium (ERP) \u2013 calculated as the 12-month forward earnings yield minus the 10-year treasury yield \u2013 fell to zero ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":19,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1759338000.0,"attribution":"www.trustnet.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.factset.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.factset.com/earningsinsight","title":"Earnings Insight","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Earnings: S&P 500 Expected to Report Earnings Growth of 11% for CY 2025.

Despite modest gains in recent years, bonds have lagged far behind the impressive returns of the S&P 500. The U.S. debt situation and rising interest rates have added to concerns. However, some experts argue that the high yields currently available could lead to positive total returns, as historical data suggests. Notably, U.S. bond funds saw record inflows in 2024, and the strong demand for fixed income assets may continue. Bonds are also considered cheap relative to equities.

Annually, PCE inflation increased to 2.7%, while core inflation\u2014excluding food and energy\u2014remained steady at 2.9%. These figures match the Federal Reserve's closely watched indicators for inflation, which influence monetary policy and interest rate decisions.\n\nMarket reactions were modestly positive: stock futures rose, Treasury yields fell slightly, and the U.S. dollar weakened. Analysts interpreted the numbers as stable inflation amid stronger-than-expected consumer spending, suggesting a still-resilient economy. Doug Beath of Wells Fargo noted the results support ongoing market confidence, while Gennadiy Goldberg of TD Securities emphasized consumer strength and stable inflation. Peter Cardillo from Spartan Capital stated that inflation remains sticky but not escalating, potentially supporting one more Fed rate cut this year. Meanwhile, Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital pointed to the labor market as a key factor for the Fed\u2019s next move. Overall, the data suggest a balanced economic outlook with moderate inflation and sustained consumer activity.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"United States to Suspend Customs De Minimis Entry for Most ...","url":"https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/united-states-suspend-customs-de-minimis-entry-most-shipments-august-29-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"On July 30, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order entitled \u201cSuspending Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment for All Countries,\u201d1 which ...","attribution":"White & Case"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Bureau of Economic Analysis"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn10search4\ue202turn10search8\ue201","start_idx":1033,"end_idx":1067,"safe_urls":["https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20250917a1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251008a.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20250917a1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement","url":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20250917a1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1758124396.0,"snippet":"Sep 18, 2025 \u2014 on reserve balances to 4.15 percent, effective September 18, 2025. in a target range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, September 16\u201317, 2025","url":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251008a.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"Federal Reserve"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Federal Reserve"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn1search3\ue201","start_idx":1299,"end_idx":1332,"safe_urls":["https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([MacroMicro](https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"US - S&P 500 - Forward PE Ratio | Series","url":"https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"US - S&P 500 - Forward PE Ratio. 2025-10-08. 23.11. 0.13.

The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF has risen by 20% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 15% gain. This shift is driven by soaring energy demand from AI data centers, electric vehicles, and clean energy infrastructure. Companies like Constellation Energy, Vistra, Dominion Energy, and PG&E are providing essential power to tech giants, such as Microsoft, boosting the utility sector\u2019s linkage to the AI boom.\n\nDespite broader market fluctuations, utilities have shown resilience\u2014on S&P 500 down days, they fell just 0.26% on average, and even posted gains a significant 35 times. The sector trades at a discount compared to the S&P 500 but is expected to deliver nearly 9% annual earnings growth over the next two years, more than double its past-decade average.\n\nAmerican Electric Power (AEP) stands out, especially with its exposure to data center hubs in Texas, Virginia, and Ohio. Analysts predict nearly 6% annual revenue growth for AEP through 2028, with corresponding EPS increases and a solid 3.2% dividend yield. AEP offers a compelling mix of safety and promising returns.","attribution":"Barron's"},{"title":"Slower production growth will push copper market to deficit in 2026, says ICSG","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/slower-production-growth-will-push-copper-market-deficit-2026-says-icsg-2025-10-08/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The International Copper Study Group (ICSG) has projected that the global refined copper market will move into a deficit of 150,000 metric tons in 2026, reversing from a previously expected surplus of 209,000 tons. This shift is driven by slower production growth due to recent mine disruptions in Indonesia, Chile, and Congo. Consequently, the ICSG has revised its 2025 global mine production growth forecast down from 2.3% to 1.4%. Although mine output growth is expected to improve to 2.3% in 2026 with new capacities and recoveries in major producing countries, refined copper production growth is anticipated to decelerate to 0.9% from 3.4% in 2025, due to limited copper concentrate availability. Meanwhile, global copper usage is projected to grow by 2.1% in 2026, led by Asia despite a slowdown in China, which accounts for 58% of global usage. Demand in Europe and Japan is expected to remain weak. Copper prices have responded by rising to a 16-month high amid concerns over supply shortages.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"U.S. Energy Information Administration"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue201","start_idx":1992,"end_idx":2011,"safe_urls":["https://www.factset.com/earningsinsight?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([factset.com](https://www.factset.com/earningsinsight?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Earnings Insight","url":"https://www.factset.com/earningsinsight?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1759509026.0,"snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Earnings: S&P 500 Expected to Report Earnings Growth of 11% for CY 2025.

This shift is driven by slower production growth due to recent mine disruptions in Indonesia, Chile, and Congo. Consequently, the ICSG has revised its 2025 global mine production growth forecast down from 2.3% to 1.4%. Although mine output growth is expected to improve to 2.3% in 2026 with new capacities and recoveries in major producing countries, refined copper production growth is anticipated to decelerate to 0.9% from 3.4% in 2025, due to limited copper concentrate availability. Meanwhile, global copper usage is projected to grow by 2.1% in 2026, led by Asia despite a slowdown in China, which accounts for 58% of global usage.

rush above $4,000/oz cements status as global bellwether","snippet":"Gold has surged past $4,000 an ounce in 2025, reaching a record high of $4,059.05, marking a 53% increase this year following a 27% gain in 2024. This rally, the strongest since 1979, highlights gold's enduring role as a global economic and geopolitical bellwether. The surge is fueled by growing investor demand for safe-haven assets amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Russia-Ukraine conflict, and political uncertainty in the U.S., Japan, and France. Expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve also contribute, as lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing gold and weaken the U.S. dollar.\n\nCentral banks continue to diversify their reserves by purchasing gold, and gold-backed ETFs have seen inflows of $64 billion worldwide in 2025, reversing years of outflows. India's gold ETFs posted record monthly inflows in September, with assets reaching $10 billion. Market analysts suggest the rally has more room to grow due to sustained investor demand. Silver has also seen record gains, trading at $51 per ounce, up 72% year-to-date, benefiting from the same safe-haven dynamics and tightening supply in the precious metals market.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1760024310.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/gold-has-surged-to-record-highs-above-usd4000-watch-out-for-these-critical-price-levels-11827094","title":"Gold Has Surged to Record Highs Above $4,000-Watch Out for These Critical Price Levels","snippet":"Gold prices have surged to all-time highs above $4,000 per ounce, driven by investor concerns about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, economic uncertainty, and expectations of an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut. As of recent trading, spot gold was around $4,035, representing a 54% increase since the start of 2025. The rally has been supported by central bank purchases, weakening confidence in the U.S. dollar, and various geopolitical tensions.\n\nTechnical analysis indicates a strong ongoing uptrend, with the relative strength index (RSI) in overbought territory above 85 and the average directional index (ADX) above 50, both underscoring strong bullish momentum. A measured move suggests a potential target of $4,160\u2014about 3% upside from current levels.\n\nKey support levels to watch during pullbacks include $3,700, which aligns with a prior consolidation phase, $3,450 near a former breakout point, and $3,250, just above the 200-day moving average and historical troughs.

This rally, the strongest since 1979, highlights gold's enduring role as a global economic and geopolitical bellwether. The surge is fueled by growing investor demand for safe-haven assets amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Russia-Ukraine conflict, and political uncertainty in the U.S., Japan, and France. Expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve also contribute, as lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing gold and weaken the U.S. dollar.\n\nCentral banks continue to diversify their reserves by purchasing gold, and gold-backed ETFs have seen inflows of $64 billion worldwide in 2025, reversing years of outflows. India's gold ETFs posted record monthly inflows in September, with assets reaching $10 billion. Market analysts suggest the rally has more room to grow due to sustained investor demand. Silver has also seen record gains, trading at $51 per ounce, up 72% year-to-date, benefiting from the same safe-haven dynamics and tightening supply in the precious metals market.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1760024310.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-vaults-over-4000-rush-safety-fed-easing-bets-2025-10-08/","title":"Gold shatters $4,000 milestone, silver belts record high as investors rush to safety","snippet":"Gold surged past $4,000 per ounce for the first time on October 8, 2025, reaching $4,050.24 in the spot market and $4,070.5 in futures, supported by geopolitical and economic uncertainty, strong investor demand for safe-haven assets, and anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts. Silver also hit a record high of $49.57, up 71% year-to-date, driven by similar safe-haven demand, tight market conditions, and strong ETF inflows. Gold has risen 54% in 2025, outperforming equities, bitcoin, and commodities like crude oil. Analysts say ongoing global conflicts, political instability in countries like France and Japan, and a weakening U.S. dollar are further fueling safe-haven interest. Central bank buying and a \"fear of missing out\" are adding to the metals' momentum. HSBC raised its silver price forecasts due to strong gold prices and renewed investor interest, while other precious metals like platinum and palladium also saw sharp gains. The rally is expected to continue into 2026, with potential for gold to approach $5,000 per ounce.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1759947433.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/4eefc53c-de68-4495-b729-b028916dd645","title":"Gold as 'debasement trade' doesn't add up","snippet":"The article analyzes the recent surge in gold prices and questions the popular \u201cdebasement trade\u201d narrative\u2014that investors are buying gold due to fears of long-term inflation and U.S. dollar devaluation caused by fiscal irresponsibility and rising debt. Despite prominent investors like Ray Dalio and Ken Griffin endorsing this theory, contradictory signals from stable Treasury yields and a steady dollar cast doubt on its validity.\n\nAlternative explanations are explored. Analysts like Dario Perkins and Ed Al-Hussainy reject the debasement theory outright, suggesting that central bank buying, illiquid markets, and momentum trading play larger roles. Others argue the gold rally reflects distrust in fiat currencies globally or concerns about the U.S. weaponizing the dollar. Some view gold more as a hedge against political or financial tail risks than a bet against the dollar specifically.\n\nUltimately, the article concludes that gold's rise is more political and speculative than a clear economic signal, and that the behavior of bond and currency markets doesn't support the full debasement narrative.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1759987807.588,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gold.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/download/file/19806/WMM-23-June-2025.pdf","title":"Weekly Markets Monitor","snippet":"Jun 23, 2025 \u2014 Gold fell last week: the LBMA Gold Price PM in USD declined by 1.9% to close Friday at.

Here's What the Experts Say","snippet":"In 2025, gold has surged over 50% year-to-date, recently breaking the $4,000 mark for the first time, fueled by massive inflows into gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which now hold nearly half a trillion dollars globally. Experts cite several driving factors behind gold's rally, including falling real yields, a weakening U.S. dollar, persistent global uncertainty, and heavy central bank purchases. Analysts suggest further gains are possible if these trends persist, but advise caution.\n\nDean Lyulkin, an investment advisor, assertively notes that gold's value as a portfolio hedge rather than a growth asset means most of the easy gains may already be realized. Meanwhile, strategists from Wells Fargo and BCA Research highlight continued ETF inflows and expectations of lower interest rates and a weaker dollar as positive indicators for gold. However, historical data shows gold's long-term returns significantly underperform broader market averages such as the S&P 500.\n\nInvestment experts recommend modest gold allocations of 5\u201310%, with consideration for entry on price dips. For investors, gold ETFs are touted as the most practical way to gain exposure, as physical ownership involves added risks and logistical complexities.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1759940851.0,"attribution":"www.kiplinger.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/07/business/gold-tops-4k-for-first-time-as-investors-flee-inflation-global-turmoil/","title":"Gold tops $4K for first time as investors flee inflation, global turmoil","snippet":"Gold prices surged past $4,000 per ounce for the first time on October 7, 2025, driven by persistent inflation, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown, and escalating global geopolitical tensions. Gold futures briefly reached $4,005.80 before slightly retreating, marking a more than 50% gain in 2025 and making it the year\u2019s best-performing major asset, surpassing stocks and cryptocurrencies. Investors, including governments like China and Russia and individual consumers, are turning to gold to protect against U.S. sanctions and domestic inflation.\n\nFinancial experts, including Ray Dalio and Ken Griffin, attributed the rally to concerns over fiscal policies, high borrowing, and inflation reminiscent of the 1970s. Dalio advocated allocating up to 15% of portfolios to gold, citing its hedge value against economic instability. Griffin warned of mounting concerns regarding the U.S. dollar\u2019s stability and market distortions due to excessive stimulus.\n\nDespite equities showing strength\u2014S&P 500 up 14%\u2014the parallel gold rally reveals underlying investor anxiety. Central banks are buying gold in record amounts, reflecting worldwide efforts to hedge against currency devaluation and economic uncertainty. Analysts caution that the rally may face short-term corrections due to overbought conditions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1759849508.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/ed7f86e8-d12a-4c0a-a7d6-8400bfde6140","title":"Gold price tops $4,000 for first time","snippet":"Gold prices have surged past $4,000 per troy ounce for the first time, reaching $4,047 amid increasing investor concerns over inflation, soaring global debt, and a prolonged U.S. government shutdown. This marks a more than 50% rise in gold prices in 2025, fueled by heavy demand from central banks seeking to diversify reserves away from the U.S. dollar and by institutional and physical buyers seeking safe-haven assets. Similarly, silver set a new peak at $49.57 an ounce.\n\nMarket experts highlighted that historic spikes in gold prices have coincided with periods of significant uncertainty, including the 2008 financial crisis, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and recent geopolitical and economic instability. Prominent investor Ray Dalio emphasized gold's role as a reliable store of value in times of fiscal stress. Central banks have continued to accumulate around 1,000 tonnes annually, regardless of price movement, reinforcing the bullish trend.\n\nThe rally has been accelerated by inflows into gold-backed ETFs and disrupted data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission due to the shutdown, compounding market opacity. Analysts warn of the \u201cparabolic\u201d and unsustainable nature of the rise, with Goldman Sachs now targeting $4,900 for gold, citing ongoing demand from central banks and investors.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1759889123.296,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gold.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/golds-long-term-expected-return-glter","title":"Gold's long-term expected return (GLTER) - World Gold Council","snippet":"We instead show that gold's long-run return has been well above inflation for over 50 years (Figure 1), more closely mirroring global gross ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1729123200.0,"attribution":"www.gold.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-market-commentary-july-2025","title":"Gold Market Commentary: Positioning revisited | World Gold Council","snippet":"Year-to-date, gold remains up 26% (Table 1).

Historically, gold has maintained its value better than paper currency, making it a reliable means of preserving wealth during economic uncertainty. Gold often serves as a hedge against inflation, though recent trends suggest it's more accurately a hedge against broad economic instability. Despite fluctuating real interest rates and the value of the U.S. dollar, gold prices have shown resilience and even growth. Its unique properties and uses in technology and dentistry further bolster its value.\n\nMoreover, central banks diversify their reserves with gold, reinforcing its strategic importance. Gold's role in portfolio diversification is significant due to its low correlation with other major assets, offering potential risk reduction and long-term returns. Supply constraints since the late 1990s have also played a part in maintaining gold's value. Today, gold\u2019s liquidity has improved with the introduction of gold ETFs and digital gold platforms. However, investors should be cautious of frauds in the gold market, especially those pitched online or through dubious advertising channels. Overall, gold remains a prudent investment for safeguarding against economic and geopolitical uncertainties.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1224003600.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68e7cb763868832b84e53b524092dcbe","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for gold inflation hedge research and correlations","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98bf6928a8cf1e3f-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"31496bfe-7597-4c9f-91f4-1a22812ba6c8","turn_exchange_id":"5f77bc14-b8e0-4b69-ab7e-d6de6a95a49a","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"31496bfe-7597-4c9f-91f4-1a22812ba6c8","children":["313ae710-1242-4650-913c-95efd92857af"]},"313ae710-1242-4650-913c-95efd92857af":{"id":"313ae710-1242-4650-913c-95efd92857af","message":{"id":"313ae710-1242-4650-913c-95efd92857af","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760029080.954505,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"USD performance analysis","content":"The Investopedia article might be outdated, so we can rely on other sources.

Despite the U.S. dollar index (DXY) falling 9% in 2025, Englander argues that productivity gains could reverse this trend, with indicators suggesting a 4.5% to 5% annualized rise in Q3. Such a boost traditionally correlates with stronger dollar performance due to improved capital inflows and profitability in corporate America.\n\nEnglander acknowledges risks including government efforts to weaken the dollar and high domestic and external debt burdens. Yet, he highlights that higher productivity should lead to increased demand for capital, raising real interest rates and reducing the incentive for international investors to hedge dollar exposure. This would further support the dollar.\n\nHe cautions that if productivity accelerates while real rates remain low, economic overheating may occur due to inflation or rising imports. While unsure of AI\u2019s exact role in this trend, Englander believes AI likely contributes to productivity advancements, although definitive data is lacking.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1760004300.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/inflation-angst-lingers-for-investors-even-as-treasury-yields-are-little-moved-by-fed-minutes-36fd4feb","title":"Inflation angst lingers for investors even as Treasury yields are little moved by Fed minutes","snippet":"Despite muted movement in Treasury yields following the release of the Federal Reserve's September 2025 meeting minutes, investor concerns about inflation remain strong. The Fed acknowledged persistent inflation, especially in core goods due to tariffs, even as services inflation appears more stable. The minutes revealed policymakers are open to further interest rate cuts, especially as labor market data shows signs of weakening. The Fed aims to reduce inflation to its 2% target by 2027, though most officials noted upside risks such as the potential persistence of elevated inflation even after tariff effects fade.\n\nThe 2-year Treasury yield slightly rose to 3.581%, though it has dropped significantly over the year. The 10-year yield remained relatively flat at 4.128%, with expectations it may stay between 4% and 4.5%. Investors are increasingly turning to inflation-protected securities like the Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF, which has returned 7.1% year-to-date and seen $2 billion in inflows. Analysts from firms like BlackRock and L&G Asset Management underscored the importance of balancing inflation control with labor market conditions, anticipating that the Fed may cut rates again in upcoming meetings due to economic softness.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1759963800.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-vaults-over-4000-rush-safety-fed-easing-bets-2025-10-08/","title":"Gold shatters $4,000 milestone, silver belts record high as investors rush to safety","snippet":"Gold surged past $4,000 per ounce for the first time on October 8, 2025, reaching $4,050.24 in the spot market and $4,070.5 in futures, supported by geopolitical and economic uncertainty, strong investor demand for safe-haven assets, and anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts. Silver also hit a record high of $49.57, up 71% year-to-date, driven by similar safe-haven demand, tight market conditions, and strong ETF inflows. Gold has risen 54% in 2025, outperforming equities, bitcoin, and commodities like crude oil. Analysts say ongoing global conflicts, political instability in countries like France and Japan, and a weakening U.S. dollar are further fueling safe-haven interest. Central bank buying and a \"fear of missing out\" are adding to the metals' momentum. HSBC raised its silver price forecasts due to strong gold prices and renewed investor interest, while other precious metals like platinum and palladium also saw sharp gains. The rally is expected to continue into 2026, with potential for gold to approach $5,000 per ounce.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1759947433.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/data/dollar-dominance-tracker-2025-10-01/","title":"Dollar Dominance Tracker","snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 While down this year, the dollar index is up 4% over a five-year period, and almost 10% higher over 20 years.

This rally, the strongest since 1979, highlights gold's enduring role as a global economic and geopolitical bellwether. The surge is fueled by growing investor demand for safe-haven assets amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Russia-Ukraine conflict, and political uncertainty in the U.S., Japan, and France. Expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve also contribute, as lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing gold and weaken the U.S. dollar.\n\nCentral banks continue to diversify their reserves by purchasing gold, and gold-backed ETFs have seen inflows of $64 billion worldwide in 2025, reversing years of outflows. India's gold ETFs posted record monthly inflows in September, with assets reaching $10 billion. Market analysts suggest the rally has more room to grow due to sustained investor demand. Silver has also seen record gains, trading at $51 per ounce, up 72% year-to-date, benefiting from the same safe-haven dynamics and tightening supply in the precious metals market.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17},"pub_date":1760024310.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-blazes-through-3900oz-new-records-investors-flee-uncertainty-2025-10-06/","title":"Gold blazes through $3,900/oz to new records as investors flee uncertainty","snippet":"Gold prices soared past $3,900 per ounce to hit a record $3,958.57 on October 6, 2025, driven by investor demand amid mounting global uncertainty and expectations of further U.S. interest rate cuts. Gold is up 48% year-to-date after a 27% gain in 2024, benefiting as a safe-haven asset during economic and political instability, including ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence. The Fed's rate cuts reduce the appeal of interest-bearing assets, weaken the U.S. dollar, and bolster gold demand. Contributing factors include central bank purchases and rising inflows into physical gold ETFs, with ETF demand reaching 587.8 metric tons through September.\n\nSilver followed suit, reaching $48.55 per ounce, its highest since May 2011, supported by industrial demand, supply constraints, and speculation over its inclusion on a U.S. critical minerals list. Analysts note silver's recent rise as a correction following underperformance and predict a fifth consecutive market deficit in 2025, estimated at 117.6 million troy ounces. Political turmoil, such as the resignation of France\u2019s new prime minister and a prolonged U.S. government shutdown, further adds to market tension, reinforcing bullion's appeal.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1759766793.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/golds-record-breaking-rally-whos-keeping-it-going-2025-09-22/","title":"Gold's record-breaking rally: who's keeping it going?","snippet":"Sep 22, 2025 \u2014 Annual net purchases of gold by central banks have exceeded 1,000 metric tons ... 2025 at 500 tons after seven tons of outflows in 2024.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":13},"pub_date":1756839995.448,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"moneyweek.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://moneyweek.com/investments/commodities/gold/gold-price","title":"Gold price passes $4,000","snippet":"As of October 8, 2025, the price of gold has soared past $4,000 per troy ounce for the first time in history, reaching a new all-time high of $4,049.

The renewed rally, gaining 11.4% just in September, comes amid a mix of geopolitical and economic uncertainties including the U.S. government shutdown, low interest rates, global inflation fears, and central bank diversification away from the U.S. dollar\u2014particularly following the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nGold's allure as a safe haven is attracting investors due to market volatility, weakened U.S. economic governance, and declining treasury yields. Central banks have continued heavy gold purchases, supporting demand and further boosting prices. Analysts suggest the conditions remain favorable for continued growth beyond $4,000, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve continues easing monetary policy.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to gold through ETFs or ETCs, gold mining stocks, or by purchasing physical gold.

Despite the U.S. dollar index (DXY) falling 9% in 2025, Englander argues that productivity gains could reverse this trend, with indicators suggesting a 4.5% to 5% annualized rise in Q3. Such a boost traditionally correlates with stronger dollar performance due to improved capital inflows and profitability in corporate America.\n\nEnglander acknowledges risks including government efforts to weaken the dollar and high domestic and external debt burdens. Yet, he highlights that higher productivity should lead to increased demand for capital, raising real interest rates and reducing the incentive for international investors to hedge dollar exposure.

Despite the U.S. dollar index (DXY) falling 9% in 2025, Englander argues that productivity gains could reverse this trend, with indicators suggesting a 4.5% to 5% annualized rise in Q3. Such a boost traditionally correlates with stronger dollar performance due to improved capital inflows and profitability in corporate America.\n\nEnglander acknowledges risks including government efforts to weaken the dollar and high domestic and external debt burdens. Yet, he highlights that higher productivity should lead to increased demand for capital, raising real interest rates and reducing the incentive for international investors to hedge dollar exposure. This would further support the dollar.\n\nHe cautions that if productivity accelerates while real rates remain low, economic overheating may occur due to inflation or rising imports.

OpenAI announced plans to acquire a 10% stake in AMD for $270 billion and will purchase tens of billions of dollars worth of AMD chips to support its AI ambitions. AMD shares surged 34% following the news. This came weeks after Nvidia also committed $100 billion to OpenAI. Other major corporate developments included AstraZeneca entering a $555 million licensing deal with Algen Biotechnologies to develop gene therapies using AI.\n\nIn the UK, Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride proposed a \u00a34 billion reform to eliminate business rates for many shops and pubs, alongside pledges to curb welfare spending. Marks & Spencer confirmed the phased closure of select in-store caf\u00e9s to prioritize high-margin products, while Ineos announced plans to cut 175 jobs and shut two plants in Germany due to high energy costs.\n\nMeanwhile, automobiles and construction sectors showed mixed performance: new car sales hit their highest September mark since 2020, but UK construction remained in contraction. European tensions rose as the US planned steep tariffs on Italian pasta, and France faced market volatility after the sudden resignation of Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu. Other business moves included Treatt\u2019s approved takeover bid, Audioboom considering a sale, and Shawbrook Bank planning a London stock market float. Gold approached $4,000 per ounce and bitcoin neared all-time highs amid safe-haven shifts driven by the US government shutdown.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"thetimes.co.uk"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn7search3\ue202turn6search3\ue201","start_idx":6459,"end_idx":6491,"safe_urls":["https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year ... - FRED","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis (DGS10) ; 2025-10-07: 4.14 ; 2025-10-06: 4.18 ; 2025-10-03: ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"FRED"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null}],"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/73272fc464d2eb11512a94df1b496196?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/dollar-faces-prolonged-weakness-amid-fed-rate-cuts-2025-10-01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/data/dollar-dominance-tracker-2025-10-01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dollar-gains-supreme-court-allows-feds-cook-stay-job-now-2025-10-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/dollar-faces-prolonged-weakness-amid-fed-rate-cuts-2025-10-01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dollar-gains-supreme-court-allows-feds-cook-stay-job-now-2025-10-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=10-year%3Breal%3Btips&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mitrade.com/insights/news/live-news/article-4-1176305-20251007?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.marketwatch.com/story/strategist-makes-jaw-dropping-call-the-dollar-will-rally-thanks-to-booming-productivity-793f0dc4?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/dollar-faces-prolonged-weakness-amid-fed-rate-cuts-2025-10-01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dollar-defensive-us-government-shutdown-looms-2025-10-01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=10-year%3Breal%3Btips&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.marketwatch.com/story/strategist-makes-jaw-dropping-call-the-dollar-will-rally-thanks-to-booming-productivity-793f0dc4?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/dollar-faces-prolonged-weakness-amid-fed-rate-cuts-2025-10-01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/dollar-faces-prolonged-weakness-amid-fed-rate-cuts-2025-10-01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/live-latest-news-uk-companies-ftse-100-shares-3v7gql7n3?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"citations":[],"request_id":"98bf6928a8cf1e3f-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"2858cd4c-5334-4b37-a482-8918f0872112","turn_exchange_id":"5f77bc14-b8e0-4b69-ab7e-d6de6a95a49a","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"2858cd4c-5334-4b37-a482-8918f0872112","children":[]}}}
