This perspective is quite simple but sometimes lost in the complexity of our university analysis. The perspective is that you have to understand the underlying economics of the businesses you invest in or work in, you have to be clear-eyed and not be swayed by the crowds or the passing fancies of the moment, and you have to learn and stick to disciplined principles of business valuation.\n\nIn the long run, this disciplined approach will, more often than not, bring success, or perhaps just as important, avoid spectacular failures. Hopefully here at the University of Florida we can successfully convey those principles to our students and create a program that attracts the very best people and, in time, the very best employers as well.\n\nSo we thank Mr. Hawkins for his gift and for creating this environment that makes it possible for a man like Warren Buffett to come to our university and share his thoughts with us today. So without any more conversation, let me introduce to you Mason Hawkins.\n\n\n### Mason Hawkins\u2019 Opening Remarks and Introduction of Warren Buffett\n\n**Mason Hawkins:**\n\nThanks a lot, Dr. Laurie. I've got a prepared thing or two to say, but before I start I wanted to just say that, looking around this audience, it's a huge improvement from when Dan Connelly and Whit Storm and some of the rest of us were here. This group's been greatly upgraded.\n\nAs a Florida graduate living in the state of Tennessee, it's been quite an experience, and so I can say without any exaggeration it's great to be back in Gator Country, especially after our little sojourn to the city of Knoxville not too long ago. If I ever hear \"Rocky Top\" again, it's going to be one time too many.\n\nThese are exciting times for value investors. They're very exciting times to be a University of Florida graduate business student. Today we're extremely fortunate and grateful to have a very special guest to share his many, many insights with us. He's someone I've admired tremendously for the last 30 years. Additionally, he is a person I think each of us could pattern our lives after as a role model, even though he happens to be an avid Nebraska Cornhusker, and we've got our scars for that too.\n\nIt's my honor as well as my privilege to welcome our lifetime's best long-term investor, Mr. Warren Buffett.\n\n\n### Warren Buffett\u2019s Opening Remarks: Format, Integrity, and Habits\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nOne million, two million, three million. Seems to be working.\n\nI'd like to just say a few words preliminarily, and then the highlight for me will be getting your questions in a few minutes, because I want to talk about what's on your mind. I urge you to throw hard balls. It's more fun for me if you put a little speed on the pitches as they come in. You can ask about anything except last week's Texas A&M game. That's off limits.\n\nWe have a couple of men here from SunTrust. I was just up at the Coke meeting and I sit next to Jimmy Williams there, who ran SunTrust for many years, and he wanted to be sure that I wore this SunTrust shirt down here. I've tried to get sponsorship on the senior golf tour; I haven't had much luck. But now on the banker\u2019s tour I'm doing a little bit better. He said I get a percentage of the increase in deposits in Gainesville, so all go out for SunTrust, dear old SunTrust.\n\nI would like to talk for just one minute to the students about your future when you leave here, because you're going to learn a tremendous amount about investments, and you'll learn enough to do well. You've all got the IQ to do well, you've all got the initiative and energy to do well, or you wouldn't be here. Most of you will succeed in meeting your aspirations. But in determining whether you succeed, there's more to it than intellect and energy, and I'd like to talk for just a second about that.\n\nIn fact, there was a fellow, Pete Kiewit in Omaha, who used to say that he looked for three things in hiring people: he looked for integrity, intelligence, and energy. And he said if the person didn't have the first one, the latter two would kill him, because if they don't have integrity, you want them dumb and lazy. You don't want them smart and energetic.\n\nI really like to talk about that first one, because we know you've got the second two. Play along with me in a little game for just a second in terms of thinking about that question. You've all been here, I guess almost all of you are second-year MBAs, and you've gotten to know your classmates. Think for a moment that I granted you the right to buy 10% of one of your classmates for the rest of his or her lifetime.\n\nNow, you can't pick one with a rich father, that doesn't count. You've got to pick somebody who's going to do it on their own merit. And I gave you an hour to think about it. Which one are you going to pick among all your classmates for the one you want to own 10% of for the rest of their lifetime?\n\nAre you going to give them an IQ test and pick the one with the highest IQ? I doubt it. Are you going to pick the one with the best grades? I doubt it. You're not even going to pick the most energetic one necessarily, or the one that displays the most initiative. You're going to start looking for qualitative factors in addition, because everybody's got enough brains here and enough energy.\n\nI would say that if you thought about it for an hour and decided who you were going to place that bet on, you'd probably pick the one who you responded the best to, the one who was going to have the leadership qualities, the one who was going to be able to get other people to carry out their interests. That would be the person who was generous and honest and who gave credit to other people even for their own ideas, all kinds of qualities like that. You could write down those qualities that you admire in this other person, whoever you admire most in the class.\n\nAnd then I would throw in a hook. I would say, as part of owning 10% of this person, you had to agree to go short 10% of somebody else in the class. That's more fun, isn't it? And you'd think, \"Well, now who do I want to go short of?\" Again, you wouldn't pick the person with the lowest IQ. You would start thinking about the person who really turned you off for one reason or another. They had various qualities, quite apart from their academic achievement, but they had various qualities that meant you didn't really want to be around them and other people didn't want to be around them.\n\nWhat were the qualities that lead to that? Well, there'd be a whole bunch of things. It's the person who's egotistical, the person who's greedy, the person who's slightly dishonest, cuts corners, all of these qualities. And you can write those down on the right-hand side of the page.\n\nAs you looked at those qualities on the left- and right-hand side, there's one interesting thing about them. It's not the ability to throw a football 60 yards. It's not the ability to run the 100-yard dash in 9.3. It's not being the best-looking person in the class. They're all qualities that, if you really want to have the ones on the left-hand side, you can have them. They are qualities of behavior, character, that are achievable. They're not forbidden to anybody in this group.\n\nAnd if you look at the qualities on the right-hand side, the ones that you find turn you off in other people, there's not a quality there that you have to have. If you have it, you can get rid of it. And you can get rid of it a lot easier at your age than you can at my age, because most behavior is habitual. They say the chains of habit are too light to be felt until they're too heavy to be broken, and there's no question about it. I see people with these self-destructive behavior patterns at my age, or even 10 or 20 years younger, and they really are entrapped by them. They go around and they do things that turn off other people right and left, and they don't need to be that way, but by a certain point they get so they can hardly change it.\n\nAt your age, you can have any habits, any patterns of behavior, that you wish. It's simply a question of which you decide. Why not decide the ones that\u2026 I mean, Ben Graham did this, and Ben Franklin did it before him. Ben Graham, in his low teens, looked around and he looked at the people he admired and he said, \"I want to be admired, so why don't I just behave like them?\" And he found there was nothing impossible about behaving like them. Similarly, he did the same thing on the reverse side in terms of getting rid of those qualities.\n\nSo I would suggest that if you write those qualities down and think about them a little while and make them habitual, you will be the one that you want to buy 10% of when you get all through. And the beauty of it is you already own 100%. You're stuck with yourself, so you might as well be that person instead of somebody else.\n\nWell, that's a short little sermon, so let's get on to what you're interested in. Like I say, you can go all over the lot. I don't know exactly how we're going to handle this, but let's start with a hand here someplace or other. Where do we go with the first one? \n\n\n### Japan, Long-Term Capital Management, Risk, and Career Choices\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nYour thoughts about Japan?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nMy thoughts about Japan. I'm not a macro guy. Now, I say to myself, Berkshire Hathaway can borrow money for 10 years at 1% in Japan. One percent. And I say to myself, \"Gee, I took Graham's class 45 years ago and I've been working hard at this thing all my life. Maybe I can earn more than 1%. If I really work hard at it, 1% annually doesn't seem impossible, does it?\" So I wouldn't want to get involved in currency risk, so I'd have to do it in something that was yen-denominated. So I'd have to be in Japanese real estate or a Japanese business or something of the sort, and all I have to do is beat 1%. That's all the money is going to cost me, and I can get it for 10 years.\n\nSo far I haven't found anything. It's kind of interesting. The Japanese companies earn very low returns on equity. They have a bunch of businesses that earn 4, 5, 6% on equity, and it's very hard to earn a lot as an investor when the business you're in doesn't earn very much money. Now, some people do it. In fact, I've got a friend, Walter Schloss, who worked with Graham at the same time I did, and it was the first way I went at stocks: to buy stocks selling way below working capital, very cheap quantitative stocks. I call it the cigar-butt approach to investing. You walk down the street and you look around for a cigar butt someplace, and finally you see one and it's soggy and kind of repulsive, but there's one puff left in it. So you pick it up and the puff is free. I mean, it's a cigar-butt stock: you get one free puff out of it and then you throw it away and you walk down the street and try to find another one.\n\nIt's not elegant, but it works. If you're looking for a free puff, it works. Those are low-return businesses, but time is the friend of the wonderful business, it's the enemy of the lousy business. If you're in a lousy business for a long time, you're going to get a lousy result, even if you buy it cheap. If you're in a wonderful business for a long time, even if you pay a little too much going in, you're going to get a wonderful result if you stay in a long time.\n\nI find very few wonderful businesses in Japan at present. Now, they may change the culture in some way so that managements get more stockholder-responsive over there and returns are higher, but at the present time you'll find a lot of low-return businesses. That was true even when the Japanese economy was booming. It's amazing: they had an incredible market without incredible companies. They were incredible in terms of doing a lot of business, but they weren't incredible in terms of the return on equity that they achieved. That's finally caught up with them. So we have so far done nothing there, but as long as money is 1%, I'll keep looking.\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nYou were rumored to be one of the rescue buyers of Long-Term Capital. What was the play there? What did you see?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nThere's a story in the current Fortune magazine\u2014the one that has Rupert Murdoch's picture on the cover\u2014that tells the whole story of our involvement. It's kind of an interesting story. It's a long story, so I won't go into all the background, but I got the really serious call about Long-Term Capital probably four weeks ago this Friday, whenever it was. It was mid-afternoon, and my granddaughter was having her birthday party that evening, and then I was flying that night to Seattle to go on a 12-day trip with Gates to Alaska on a private train, all kinds of things where I was really out of communication.\n\nBut I got this call on a Friday afternoon saying that things were really getting serious there. I'd had some other calls before that\u2014the article gets into it\u2014a few weeks earlier. I know those people, most of them, pretty well. A lot of them were at Salomon when I was there. The place was imploding, and the Fed was sending people up that weekend. So between that Friday and the following Wednesday, when the New York Fed in effect orchestrated a rescue effort, but without any federal money involved, I was quite active.\n\nI was having this terrible time because we were sailing up through these canyons, which held no interest for me whatsoever, in Alaska. The captain would say, \"If we just steer over here, we might see some bears and whales,\" and I'd say, \"Steer where you've got a good satellite connection,\" because I wanted to be on the phone. In fact, there's a picture at Old Faithful where I've got Old Faithful going off behind me and I've got my back to it. I'm on the phone, which the people in the group thought was kind of funny, the way I was working the phone.\n\nWe put in a bid on Wednesday morning. By then I was in Bozeman, Montana, and I talked to Bill McDonough, the head of the New York Fed, about 10 o'clock. They were having a meeting of the bankers at 10 o'clock that morning in New York, and we actually delivered a message to him. He called me out there in Wyoming a little bit before 10 New York time and we made a bid. Because it was being done at a long distance and everything, it was really the outline of a bid.\n\nIn the end, it was a bid for $250 million essentially for the net assets, but we would have put in three and three-quarter billion on top of that. It would have been three billion from Berkshire Hathaway, 700 million from AIG, and 300 million from Goldman Sachs. We submitted that, but we put a very short time fuse on it, because when you're bidding on a hundred billion dollars\u2019 worth of securities that are moving around, you don't want to leave a fixed-price bid out there very long. Plus, we were worried about it getting shopped. In the end, the bankers made the deal, but it was an interesting period.\n\nThe whole Long-Term Capital Management story\u2014 and I hope most of you are familiar with it\u2014is really fascinating, because if you take John Meriwether and Eric Rosenfeld, Larry Hilibrand, Greg Hawkins, Victor Haghani, the two Nobel Prize winners Merton and Scholes, if you take the 16 of them, they probably had as high an average IQ as any 16 people working together in one business in the country, including at Microsoft or wherever you want to name. So you've got an incredible amount of intellect in that room.\n\nNow combine that with the fact that those 16 had had extensive experience in the field they were operating in. This was not a bunch of guys who had made their money selling men's clothing and then all of a sudden went into the securities business. In aggregate, the 16 had probably had 350 or 400 years of experience doing exactly what they were doing. Then you throw in the third factor that most of them had virtually all of their very substantial net worths in the business. They had their own money up\u2014hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money up. Super-high intellect, working in a field they knew, and essentially they went broke.\n\nThat, to me, is absolutely fascinating. If I ever write a book, it's going to be called *Why Smart People Do Dumb Things.* My partner says it should be autobiographical, but this might be an interesting illustration. These are perfectly decent guys. I respect them, and they helped me out when I had problems with Salomon, so they're not bad people at all.\n\nBut to make money they didn't have and didn't need, they risked what they did have and did need. That's foolish. That is just plain foolish. It doesn't make any difference what your IQ is. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. I don't care whether the odds are 100 to 1 that you succeed or 1,000 to 1 that you succeed. If you hand me a gun with a million chambers in it and there's a bullet in one chamber, and you say, \"Put it up to your temple. How much do you want to be paid to pull it once?\" I'm not going to pull it. You can name any sum you want, but it doesn't do anything for me on the upside, and I think the downside is fairly clear. So I'm not interested in that kind of a game.\n\nYet people do it financially without thinking about it very much. There was a great book\u2014it wasn't a great book, it was a great title; it was a lousy book\u2014with a great title by Walter Gutman. The title was *You Only Have to Get Rich Once.* That's pretty fundamental, isn't it?\n\nWhat difference does it make if you've got $100 million at the start of the year and you're going to make 10% if you're unleveraged and 20% if you're leveraged 99 times out of 100? What difference does it make at the end of the year whether you've got 110 million or 120 million? It makes no difference at all. If you die at the end of the year, the guy that writes up the story may make a typo and he may say 110 even if you had 120, so you've gained nothing at all. It makes absolutely no difference. It makes no difference to your family. It makes no difference to anything.\n\nYet the downside, particularly when managing other people's money, is not only losing all your money, but it's disgrace and humiliation and facing friends whose money you've lost and everything. I just can't imagine an equation that makes sense for that. Yet 16 guys with very high IQs, who are very decent people, entered into that game, and I think it's madness.\n\nIt's produced by an overreliance, to some extent, on things. Those guys would tell me back when I was at Salomon that a six-sigma event wouldn't touch them, or a seven-sigma event. But they were wrong. History does not tell you the probabilities of future financial things happening. They had a great reliance on mathematics. They felt that the beta of the stock told you something about the risk of the stock. It doesn't tell you a damn thing about the risk of the stock in my view. Sigmas do not tell you about the risk of going broke, in my view\u2014maybe in their view now too.\n\nI don't like to even use them as an example, because the same thing in a different way could happen to any of us, where we really have a blind spot about something that's crucial, because we know a whole lot about something else. It's like Henry Kaufman said the other day: the people that are going broke in this situation are just two types\u2014the ones who knew nothing, and the ones that knew everything.\n\nI urge you, in anything\u2026 We never basically borrow money. We get float through our insurance business to do things, but I never borrowed money. I never borrowed money when I had $10,000, basically, because what difference did it make? I was having fun as I went along. It didn't make any difference whether I had $10,000 or a million dollars or $10 million, except if I had a medical emergency or something like that. I was going to do the same things when I had a lot of money as when I had very little money.\n\nIf you think about the difference between me and you in terms of how we live, we wear the same clothes, basically. SunTrust gives me mine. We eat\u2014you know, we all have a chance to drink the juice of the gods here\u2014but we all go to McDonald's, or better yet Dairy Queen. We live in a house that's warm in winter and cool in summer, and we watch Nebraska\u2013Texas A&M on a big screen. You see it the same way I see it. Our lives aren't that different. You'll get decent medical care if something happens to you, and I'll get decent medical care.\n\nThe only thing we do is we travel differently. I ride around in this little plane. I love it, and that takes money. But if you leave that aside, we travel differently. Other than travel, what can I do that you can't do? Now, I get to work in a job that I love, but I've always worked in a job I love. I loved it when it was a big deal if I made a thousand bucks.\n\nI urge you to work in jobs you love. I think you're out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don't like because you think it'll look good on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I was with a fellow at Harvard the other day who was taking me over to talk, and he was 28. He was telling me what he'd done in life, which was terrific. Then I said, \"What are you going to do next?\" And he said, \"Well, after I get out my MBA, I think maybe I have to go to work for a management consulting firm because it'll look good on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\"\n\nI said, \"Wait a second. You're 28. You've been doing all these things. You've got a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that's ten times as good as anybody I've ever seen already. If you take another job you don't like, isn't that a little like saving up sex for your old age?\" There comes a time when you ought to just start doing what you know. I think I got the point across to him.\n\nYou ought to take a job when you get out of here\u2014take a job you love. Don't take a job that you think is going to look good on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Take a job you love. You may change it later on, but you'll jump out of bed in the morning. When I got out of Columbia, the first thing, I tried to go to work for Graham immediately. I offered to go to work for him for nothing. He said I was overpriced. But I kept pestering. I went out to Omaha and I sold securities for three years and I kept writing him and giving him ideas and doing all\u2026 Finally I went to work for him for a couple of years, and it was a great experience.\n\nI've always really worked in a job that I loved doing, and you should really take a job that, if you were independently wealthy, you would take. That's the job to take, because that's the one that you're going to have great fun in. You'll learn something, you'll be excited about it, and you can't miss. You may go do something else later on, but you'll get way more out of it. I don't care what the starting salary is or anything of the sort.\n\nIf you think you're going to be a lot happier if you've got 2X instead of X, you're probably making a mistake. You ought to find something you like that works with that. You'll get in trouble if you think that making 10X or 20X is the answer to everything in life, because then you will do things like borrow money when you shouldn't, or maybe cut corners on things that your employer wants you to cut corners on. It just doesn't make any sense. You won't like it when you look back on it.\n\n\n### What Buffett Looks for in a Business: Simplicity, Moats, and Brands\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nWould you talk to the students about the companies that you like? I don't mean names, I mean what makes the companies things you like.\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nI like businesses I can understand. We'll start with that. That narrows it down about 90%. There are all kinds of things I don't understand, but fortunately there are enough I do understand. You've got this big wide world; almost every company's publicly owned, so you've got all of American business practically available to you. To start with, doesn't it make sense to go with things that you think you can understand?\n\nYou can understand some things. I can understand this. Anybody can understand this. This is a product that basically hasn't been changed much\u2014I think they added the cherry\u2014since 1886 or whatever it was. It's a simple business. It's not an easy business. I don't want a business that's easy for competitors. I want a business with a moat around it. I want a very valuable castle in the middle, and then I want the duke who's in charge of that castle to be honest and hardworking and able. Then I want a big moat around the castle.\n\nThat moat can be various things. The moat in a business like our auto insurance business at GEICO is low cost. People have to buy auto insurance, so everybody's going to have one auto insurance policy per car, basically per driver. I can't sell them 20, but they have to buy one. They're going to buy it based on service and cost. Most people will assume the service is fairly identical among companies or close enough, so they're going to do it on cost. So I\u2019ve got to be the low-cost producer. That's my moat. To the extent my costs get lower than the other guy, I've thrown a couple of sharks into the moat.\n\nAll the time, if you've got a wonderful castle, there are people out there going to try and attack it and take it away from you. I want a castle that I can understand, but I want a castle with a moat around it. Thirty years ago Eastman Kodak's moat was just as wide as Coca-Cola's moat. If you were going to take a picture of your six-month-old baby, and you were going to want to look at that picture 20 years from now, and you're going to want to look at it 50 years from now, and you're never going to get a chance\u2014you're not a professional photographer so that you can evaluate what's going to look good 20 or 50 years later\u2014what is in your mind about that photography company is what counts, because they are promising you that the picture you take today is going to be terrific to look at 20 or 30 or 50 years from now, about something that's very important to you, maybe your own child.\n\nKodak had that in spades 30 years ago. They owned that. They had what I call share of mind. Forget about market share\u2014share of mind. They had something in everybody's mind around the country, around the world, with the little yellow box and everything, that said, \"Kodak is the best.\" That's priceless. They've lost some of that. They haven't lost it all, and not due to George Fisher, who runs it\u2014George is doing a great job\u2014but they let that moat narrow. They let Fuji come and start narrowing the moat in various ways. They let them get into the Olympics and take away that special aspect that only Kodak was fit to photograph the Olympics. So Fuji gets there, and immediately in people's minds Fuji becomes more on a parity with Kodak. You haven't seen that with Coke. Coke's moat is wider now than it was 30 years ago.\n\nYou can't see the moat day by day, but every time the infrastructure gets built in some country that isn't yet profitable for Coke but will be 20 years from now, the moat is widening a little bit. Things are all the time changing that moat in one direction or another. Ten years from now you can see the difference. Our managers of the businesses we run\u2014I\u2019ve got one message to them, which is to widen the moat. We want to throw crocodiles and sharks and everything else\u2014gators, I guess\u2014into the moat to keep away competitors.\n\nThat comes about through service, it comes about through quality of product, it comes about through cost, it comes about sometimes through patents, it comes about through real estate location. Those are the businesses I'm looking for.\n\nWhat kind of businesses am I going to find like that? I'm going to find them in simple products, because I'm not going to be able to figure out what the moat's going to look like for Oracle or Lotus or Microsoft 10 years from now. Gates is the best businessman I've ever run into, and they've got a hell of a position, but I really don't know what that business is going to look like 10 years from now, and I certainly don't know what his competitors' businesses are going to look like 10 years from now.\n\nI'll name one I don't own: I know what the chewing gum business is going to look like 10 years from now. The Internet is not going to change how we chew gum, and nothing much else is going to change how we chew gum. Are there going to be lots of new products? Are Spearmint, Juicy Fruit and all those going to evaporate? It isn't going to happen. You give me a billion dollars and tell me to go in the chewing gum business and try and make a real dent in Wrigley, I can't do it. That's the way I think about businesses. I say to myself, \"Give me a billion dollars, and how much can I hurt the guy? Give me $10 billion, and how much can I hurt Coca-Cola around the world?\" I can't do it. Those are good businesses.\n\nNow give me some money, tell me to hurt somebody in some other fields, and I can figure out how to do it. So I want a simple business, easy to understand, great economics, honest and able management, and then I can see, in a general way, where they're going to be 10 years from now. If I can't see where they're going to be 10 years from now, I don't want to buy it, basically. I don't want to buy any stock where, if they closed the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow for five years, I wouldn't be happy owning it.\n\nIf I buy a farm and I don't get a quote on it for five years, I'm happy if the farm does okay. I buy an apartment house; if I don't get a quote on it for five years, I'm happy if the apartment house produces the returns that I expect. But people buy a stock and they look at the price the next morning and they decide whether they're doing well or not doing well. It's crazy, because they're buying a piece of a business. That's what Graham\u2014the most fundamental part of what he taught me\u2014is: you're not buying a stock, you're buying a part ownership in a business. You will do well if the business does well and if you didn't pay a totally silly price, and that's what it's all about.\n\nYou ought to buy businesses you understand, just like if you're buying farms you ought to buy farms you understand. It's not complicated. In calling this Graham-Buffett, it's just pure Graham. I was very fortunate because I picked up a book when I was 19. I got interested in stocks when I was about six or seven, and I bought my first stock when I was 11. I was playing around with all this stuff, I had charts and volume, and I was making all kinds of technical calculations. Then I picked up a little book and it just said that you're not buying some little ticker symbol that bounces around every day, you're buying a part of a business. As soon as I started thinking about it that way, everything else became very simple. So we buy businesses we think we can understand.\n\nThere's no one here that can't understand the Coca-Cola Company. I'd say there's no one here that can understand some new Internet company. I said at the annual meeting this year that if I were teaching a class in business school, on the final exam I would pass out the information on an Internet company and ask each student to value it. Anybody that gave me an answer, I'd flunk. I don't know how to do it, but people do it every day.\n\nIt's more exciting. If you look at it like going to the races or something, that's a different thing. But if you're investing\u2014investing is putting out money to be sure of getting more money back later at an appropriate rate\u2014and to do that you have to understand what you're doing it in. You have to understand the business. You can understand some businesses, but not all businesses.\n\n\n### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Analysis and Circle of Competence\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nYou covered half of it, which is trying to understand a business and buying a business, but you also alluded to getting a return on the amount of capital you invest in the business as an investor. That comes back to: what are you paying for the business? How do you determine what you think is a fair price to pay for the business?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nThat's a tough thing to decide, but I don't want to buy into any business I'm not terribly sure of. If I'm terribly sure of it, it probably isn't going to offer incredible returns. Why should something that is essentially a cinch to do well offer you 40% a year or something like that? We don't have huge returns in mind, but we do have in mind never losing anything.\n\nWe bought See's Candy in 1972. See's Candy was then selling 16 million pounds of candy at $1.95 a pound and it was making two bits a pound, or $4 million pre-tax. We paid $25 million for it. It took no capital to speak of. When we looked at that business, basically my partner Charlie and I really just decided whether there was a little untapped pricing power there. In other words, whether that $1.95 box of candy could just as easily sell for $2 or $2.25. If it could sell for $2.25, another 30 cents a pound on 16 million pounds was almost $5 million pretax, which on a $25 million purchase price was fine.\n\nWe never hired a consultant in our lives. Our idea of consulting is going out and buying a box of candy. But what we did know was that they had share of mind in California. There was something special. Every person in California had something in their mind about See's Candy, and overwhelmingly it was favorable. They had taken a box on Valentine's Day and given it to some girl. She'd kissed them. If she'd slapped them, we'd have no business. But as long as she kisses them, that's what we want in their mind: See's Candy\u2014getting kissed. If we can get that in the minds of people, we can raise prices.\n\nI bought it in 1972. Every year I\u2019ve raised the price on December 26th. I raise it the day after Christmas, because we sell a lot at Christmas. We'll make $60 million this year. We'll sell 30 million pounds and make $2 a pound. Same business, same formulas, same everything\u201460 million bucks. Still doesn't take any capital, and we'll make more money ten years from now. Of that $60 million, we make about 55 million in the three weeks before Christmas, and our company song is \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus.\" It is a good business.\n\nThe important thing about that business is to think about it a little. People don't buy\u2014most people don't buy\u2014boxed chocolates to consume themselves. They buy them as gifts. Somebody's birthday. More likely it's a holiday. Valentine's Day is the single biggest day of the year. Christmas is the biggest season by far, but women buy for Christmas and they plan ahead and buy over a two- or three-week period. Men buy on Valentine's Day. They're driving home. We run ads on the radio: guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt. The guys are veering off the freeway right and left, and they won't dare go home without a box of candy when we get through with them on our radio ads. Valentine's Day is the biggest day.\n\nCan you imagine going home on Valentine's Day\u2014our See's Candy is now 11 bucks a pound, thanks to my brilliance\u2014and let's say there's candy available at $6 a pound. Do you really want to walk in on Valentine's Day\u2014your wife's got all these favorable images of See's Candy over the years, and she sees you, and that's the way she thinks of you during the rest of the year when you really behave badly\u2014and you walk in and say, \"Honey, this year I took the low bid,\" and then hand her a box of cheap candy? It just isn't going to work. In a sense, it's not price-dependent.\n\nThink of Disney. Disney is selling, say, home videos for $16.95 or $18.95 or whatever, all over the world. People\u2014and we'll say particularly mothers in this case\u2014have something in their mind about Disney. Every person in this room, when you say \"Disney,\" has something in their mind about it. If I say \"Universal Pictures,\" you don't have anything in your mind. If I say \"20th Century Fox,\" you don't have anything special in your mind. If I say \"Disney,\" you've got something in your mind, and that's true around the world.\n\nNow picture yourself with a couple of young kids who you want to put away for a couple of hours every day so you get a little peace of mind. If you get them one video, they'll watch it 20 times. So you go to the video store, or wherever you buy the video. Are you going to sit there and preview ten different videos and watch them each for an hour and a half to decide which one your kids should watch? No. Let's say there's one there for $6.95 and the Disney's there for $17.95. If you take the Disney video, you're going to be okay, so you buy it. You don't have to make a quality decision on something that you don't want to spend the time to do. So you can get a little bit more money if you're Disney, and you'll sell a lot more videos. It makes it a wonderful business. It makes it very tough for the other guy.\n\nHow would you try to create a brand? DreamWorks is trying, but how would you try to create a brand that competes with Disney around the world and to replace the concept that people have in their minds about Disney with something that says \"Universal Pictures,\" so that the mother's going to walk in and pick out a Universal Pictures video in preference to a Disney? It's not going to happen.\n\nCoca-Cola is associated with people being happy around the world. We're every place they're happy. We're at Disney World or Disneyland, at the World Cup, at the Olympics. Wherever people are happy, happiness and Coke go together. You give me, I don't care how much money, and tell me that I'm going to do that with RC Cola around the world and have five billion people that have a favorable image in their mind about RC Cola. It can't get done. You can fool around. You can do anything you want to do\u2014you can have price discounts on weekends and everything\u2014but you're not going to touch it. That's what you want to have in a business. That's the moat. You want that moat to widen.\n\nIf you're See's Candy, you want to do everything in the world to make sure that the experience of giving that gift leads to a favorable reaction. That means what's in the box. It means the person that sells it to you, because all our business is done when we're terribly busy. People come in in those weeks before Christmas or on Valentine's Day. There are long lines. So at five o'clock in the afternoon, some woman is selling the last person the last box of candy, and that person's been waiting in line for maybe 20 or 30 customers. If the salesperson smiles at that last customer, our moat is widened. If she snarls at them, our moat is narrowed. We can't see it, but it's going on every day. That's the key to it. That's the total part of the product delivery: having everything associated with it say \"See's Candy\" and \"something pleasant happening.\" That's what business is all about.\n\n\n### Mistakes, Omission vs. Commission, and Learning\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nWhen purchasing a company, how much qualitative analysis do you do versus quantitative, and have you ever bought a company where the numbers told you not to?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nThose are the best buys. The question is whether I've ever bought a company where the numbers told me not to, and how much is qualitative and how much is quantitative. The best buys have been when the numbers almost tell you not to, because then you feel so strongly about the product\u2014not just the fact that you're getting a used cigar butt cheap\u2014that it's compelling.\n\nI owned a windmill company at one time. Windmills are cigar butts, believe me. I bought it very cheap, at a third of working capital, and we made money out of it, but there's no repetitive money to be earned. There's a one-time profit in something like that. It's just not the thing to be doing. I went through that phase. I bought streetcar companies and all kinds of things.\n\nIn terms of the qualitative, I probably understand the qualitative the moment I get the phone call. Almost every business we've bought has taken five or ten minutes in terms of analysis. We bought two businesses this year. General Re is an $18 billion or some such deal. I've never been to their home office. I hope it's there. There could be just a few guys and they say, \"What numbers should we send Buffett this month?\" I can see them coming in once a month and saying, \"We'll just tell him we've got 20 billion in the bank this month instead of 18 billion or something.\" I've never been there.\n\nBefore I bought Executive Jet, which is fractional ownership of jets, I'd never been there. I bought my family a quarter interest in the program three years earlier, and I'd seen the service and seen it develop well, and I got the numbers. If you don't know enough about the business instantly, you won't know enough in a month or two months. You have to have sort of the background of understanding, and knowing what you do understand and don't understand. That is the key. It's defining what I call your circle of competence.\n\nEverybody's got a different circle of competence. The important thing is not how big the circle is; the important thing is staying inside the circle. If that circle has only got 30 companies in it out of the thousands on the Big Board, as long as you know which 30 they are, you're okay. You should know those businesses well enough so that you don't need to do lots of work.\n\nI did a lot of work in the earlier years just in getting familiar with businesses. The way I would do that is I would go out and use what Phil Fisher called the \"scuttlebutt\" approach. I'd go out and talk to customers, maybe ex-employees in some cases. I'd talk to suppliers. Every time I'd see somebody in an industry\u2014let's say I was interested in the coal industry\u2014I\u2019d go around and see every coal company. I'd ask every CEO, \"If you could only buy stock in one coal company that wasn't your own, which one would it be and why?\" You piece those things together and you learn a lot about the business after a while. Funny thing is, you get very similar answers as long as you ask about competitors.\n\nI'd say, \"If you've got a silver bullet and you can put it through the head of one competitor, which competitor and why?\" You'll find out who the best guy in the industry is in that case, or the one that's coming up. There's a lot of things you can learn about a business. I've done that in the past on the businesses that I feel I could understand, so I don't have to do much of that anymore.\n\nThe nice thing about investing is you don't have to learn anything very new. You can do it if you want to, but if you learned about Wrigley chewing gum 40 years ago, you still understand Wrigley chewing gum. There aren't a lot of great new insights to get as you go along. So you do get a database in your head.\n\nI had a guy, Frank Rooney, who ran Melville for many years. His father-in-law died. He owned a company called H.H. Brown, a shoe company, and he put it up with Goldman Sachs. But he was playing golf with a friend of mine here in Florida and mentioned to this friend, and the guy said, \"Why don't you call Warren?\" He called me at the end of the golf match, and in five minutes I basically had a deal. I knew Frank, and I knew the kind of business. I sort of knew the basic economics of a shoe business, so I could buy. Quantitatively, I've got to decide what the price is, but that's either yes or no. I don't fool around a lot with negotiations. If they name a price that makes sense to me, I buy it. If they don't, I was happy the day before, so I'll be happy the day after without owning it.\n\n\n### Coca-Cola, Asia, and Long-Term Economics\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nCoca-Cola just announced lowering expectations in terms of their future earnings and income. In light of the fact that Coke has a lot of their profits coming from outside the United States, how do you think the Asian crisis is going to affect Coke?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nThe question is about the Asian crisis and how it affects a company like Coke, which recently announced earnings. They just announced the third quarter earnings, but a few weeks ago they tipped people off that they were going to be lower in the fourth quarter.\n\nBasically, I love it. The market for Coca-Cola products is going to grow far faster over the next 20 years internationally than it will in the United States. It'll grow in the United States on a per capita basis, but it's going to go faster elsewhere. The fact that it's going to be a tough period for\u2014who knows\u2014three months or three years, it won't be tough for 20 years. People are still going to work productively around the world, and they're going to find that this is a bargain product in terms of the portion of their working day that they have to give up in order to have one of these\u2014or better yet, five of them a day like I do.\n\nThis is a product\u2026 In 1936, when I first bought six of those for a quarter and sold them for a nickel each, and it was in a 6\u00bd-ounce bottle and you paid a 2-cent deposit on the bottle, that was a 6\u00bd-ounce bottle for a nickel. At that time it's now a 12-ounce can, which, if you buy it on weekends or if you buy in bigger quantity so much money doesn't go to the packaging, you essentially can buy the 12 ounces for not much more than 20 cents. So you're paying not much more than twice the per-ounce price of 1936. It is a product that's gotten cheaper and cheaper in relative terms to people's earning power over the years, and which people love in 200 countries. You have the per capita use going up every year for a product over 100 years old, and that dominates the market. It is unbelievable.\n\nOne thing that people don't understand, one of the things that makes this product worth tens and tens of billions of dollars, is one simple fact about all colas\u2014but we'll call it Coca-Cola for the moment, happens to be a name I like. Cola has no taste memory. You can drink one of these at 9 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 3 in the afternoon, 5 o'clock. The one at 5 o'clock will taste just as good to you as the one you drank early in the morning. You can't do that with cream soda, root beer, orange, grape\u2014name it. All of those things accumulate on you. Most foods and beverages accumulate on you. You get sick of them after a while.\n\nIf you eat\u2026 I mean, we get these people to go to work for us at See's Candy and we tell them they can eat all the candy they want. The first day they go crazy, but after a week they're eating about the same amount they ate if they were buying it, because chocolate accumulates on you. Everything accumulates. There is no taste memory to cola. That means that you get people around the world that are heavy users that'll drink five a day, or Diet Coke maybe seven or eight a day, and they'll never do that with other products. So you get this incredible per capita consumption.\n\nThe average person in this part of the world\u2014well, maybe a little north of here\u2014drinks about 64 ounces of liquid a day. You can have all 64 ounces of that be Coke and you will not get fed up with Coke if you like it to start with, in the least. But if you do that with almost anything else, if you eat just one product all day, you'll get a little sick of it after a while. It's a huge factor. So that today, over one billion 8-ounce servings of Coca-Cola products will be sold in the world, and that will grow year by year. It'll grow in every country virtually. It'll grow on a per capita basis, and 20 years from now it'll have grown a lot faster internationally than in the U.S.\n\nI really like that market better, because there's more growth there over time. But it will hurt them in the short term right now, and it is hurting them in the short term right now. That doesn't mean anything. Coca-Cola went public in, I think it was, 1919. Stock sold for $40 a share. Before that it was the Candler family. They bought it for $2,000\u2014the whole business\u2014as the Candlers back in the late 1880s and a couple of purchases. Now he goes public in 1919, $40 a share. One year later it's selling for $19. It's gone down 50% in one year. You might think that's some kind of disaster, and you might think that sugar prices increased and the bottlers were rebellious and a whole bunch of things. You can always find a few reasons why that wasn't the ideal moment to buy it.\n\nYears later you'd have seen the Great Depression, World War II, sugar rationing, thermonuclear weapons, the whole thing. There's always a reason. But in the end, if you bought one share for 40 bucks and reinvested the dividends, it'd be worth about $5 million now. That factor so overrides anything else. If you're right about the business, you'll make a lot of money, and the timing part of it is a very tricky thing. So I don't worry about any given event if I've got a wonderful business, what it does to next year or something of the sort.\n\nPrice controls have been in this country at various times, and that fouls up even the best of businesses. I wouldn't be able to raise the price on December 26th at See's Candy if we had price controls, and we've had them in this country. That doesn't make it a lousy business if that happens to happen, because you're not going to have price controls forever. We had them in the early '70s. With a wonderful business, you can figure out what will happen. You can't figure out when it will happen. You don't want to focus too much on when; you want to focus on what. If you're right about what, you don't have to worry about when very much.\n\n\n### Investing Mistakes: Commission, Omission, and Opportunity Cost\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nAs the most successful investor of these times, what investment mistakes have you made?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nThe question is about my business mistakes. How much time do you have?\n\nThe interesting thing about the mistakes, in investments at least for me and for my partner Charlie Munger, is that the biggest mistakes have not been mistakes of commission; they've been mistakes of omission. They're where we knew enough about the business to do something, and for one reason or another we sat there sucking our thumbs instead of doing something. We've passed up things where we could have made billions and billions of dollars from things we understood. Forget about things we don't understand. The fact I could have made billions out of Microsoft doesn't mean anything because I never understood Microsoft.\n\nBut if I can make billions out of healthcare stocks, I should make it, and I didn't. When the Clinton healthcare program was proposed and they all went in the tank, we should have made a ton of money out of that, because I could understand it. I didn't. I should have made a ton of money out of Fannie Mae back in the mid-'80s because I understood it, and I didn't do it. Those are billion-dollar mistakes or multi-billion-dollar mistakes that the generally accepted accounting principles don't pick up.\n\nThe mistakes you see: We made a mistake\u2014well, I made a mistake\u2014buying U.S. Air preferred some years ago. I had a lot of money around. I make mistakes when I get cash. Charlie tells me to go to a bar instead and don't hang around the office, but I hang around the office and I've got it burning a hole in my pocket and I do something dumb. It happens every time. I bought this thing. Nobody made me buy it. I now have an 800 number I call every time I think about buying stock in an airline, and they talk me down. I say, \"I'm Warren, I'm an air-oholic,\" and then the guy says, \"Keep talking, don't hang up, don't do anything rash,\" and finally I get over it.\n\nI bought it, and it looked like we were going to lose all our money in that. We came very close to losing all our money. You can say we deserved to lose all our money. We bought it because it was an attractive security, but it was in not an attractive business. I did the same thing with Salomon. I bought an attractive security in a business that I wouldn't have bought the equity in. You can say that's one form of mistake: buying something because you like the terms when you don't like the business that well. I've done that in the past and will probably do it again.\n\nThe bigger mistakes, though, were the ones of omission. Back when I had the $10,000, I put $2,000 of it into a Sinclair service station, which I lost. My opportunity cost on that is about $6 billion right now. Fairly big mistake. It makes me feel good when Berkshire goes down then, because the cost of my Sinclair station goes down too\u2014my 20% opportunity cost.\n\nI will say this: you talk about learning from mistakes. I really believe it's better to learn from other people's mistakes as much as possible. But we don't spend any time looking back at Berkshire. I've got a partner, Charlie Munger. We've been pals for 40 years. We've never had an argument. We disagree on things a lot, but we don't have arguments about it, and we never look back. We just figure there's so much to look forward to that there's just no sense thinking about what we might have done. It just doesn't make any difference. You can only live life forward. You can learn something perhaps from the mistakes, but the big thing to do is stick with the businesses you understand.\n\nIf there's a generic mistake, it's getting outside your circle of competence and buying something because somebody tips you on it, or in an area you don't know anything about. You should learn something from that, which is that you stay with what you can figure out yourself. You really want your decision-making to be by looking in the mirror and saying to yourself, \"I am buying 100 shares of General Motors at 55 because\u2026\" It's your responsibility. If you're buying it, there's got to be a reason, and if you can't state the reason, you shouldn't buy it. If it's because somebody told you about it at a cocktail party, not good enough. If it's because the volume or the chart looks good on it or anything like that, not good enough. It's got to be a reason you'd buy the business. We stick to that pretty carefully. That's one of the things Ben Graham taught me.\n\n\n### Why Macro Forecasts Don\u2019t Matter, and Staying Away from Wall Street Noise\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nWith the current continuous economic situation in the world, although our economy seems to be still chugging along quite well, where are we going? What's going to happen with interest rates?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nQuestion about what's going to happen to interest rates and where we're going in the world. I don't think about the macro stuff. What you really want to do in investments is figure out what's important and knowable. If it's unimportant or unknowable, you forget about it. What you're talking about is important, but in my view it's not knowable.\n\nUnderstanding Coca-Cola is knowable, or Wrigley or Eastman Kodak or something like that. You can understand those businesses. That's knowable. Whether it turns out to be important depends on where your valuation leads you and the current price and all of that. But we have never either bought a business or not bought a business because of any macro feeling of any kind. We don't read things about predictions about interest rates or business or anything like that, because it doesn't make any difference.\n\nLet's say in 1972, when we bought See's Candy, Nixon put on price controls a little bit later. Let's say we'd seen that. So what? We would have missed a chance to buy something for $25 million that's earning $60 million pretax now. We don't want to pass up the chance to do something intelligent because of some prediction about something that we're no good at anyway. So we just don't read or listen to or do anything in relation to macro factors at all\u2014zero.\n\nThe typical investment counseling organization goes out and they bring out their economist, trot him out, and he gives you this big macro picture. Then they start working from there on down. In our view, that's nonsense. If Alan Greenspan was on one side of me and Bob Rubin on the other side, and they were both whispering in my ear exactly what they're going to do the next 12 months, it wouldn't make any difference to me in what I pay for Executive Jet or General Reinsurance or anything else I do.\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nWhat's the benefit of being out of the Street\u2014being in Omaha instead of on Wall Street?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nThe question is about the benefit of being an out-of-towner as opposed to being on Wall Street. I worked in Wall Street for a couple of years. I've got my best friends actually on both coasts and I like seeing them, and I get ideas when I go there. But the best way to think about investments is to be in a room with no one else and just think. If that doesn't work, nothing else is going to work.\n\nThe disadvantage of being in any kind of a market-type environment\u2014in Wall Street or wherever\u2014would be that you get overstimulated. You think you have to do something every day. The Candler family paid $2,000 for this company. You don't have to do much else if you pick one of those. The trick then is not to do anything else, even not to sell it in 1919, which the family did later on.\n\nWhat you're looking for is some way to get one good idea a year and then ride it to its full potential. That's very hard to do in an environment where people are shouting prices back and forth every five minutes and shoving reports under your nose and all that, because Wall Street makes its money on activity; you make your money on inactivity. If everybody in this room trades their portfolio around every day with every other person, you're all going to end up broke, and the intermediaries are going to end up with all the money.\n\nOn the other hand, if you all own a stock in a group of average businesses and just sit here for the next 50 years, you'll end up with a fair amount of money and your broker will be broke. His activity\u2014he's like a doctor who gets paid on how often he gets you to change pills. If he gives you one pill and it cures you the rest of your life, he's got one sale, one transaction, and that's it. But if he can convince you that changing pills every day is the way to great health, it'll be great for him in the prescription-writing business, and you'll be out a lot of money and you won't be any healthier; you'll be a lot worse off financially.\n\nSo you want to stay away from any environment that stimulates activity, and Wall Street would have the effect of doing that. I use it\u2014I'll go back about once every six months\u2014and I go back with a whole list of things I want to check out one way or another, companies I want to see, and I get my money's worth out of those trips. But then I go back to Omaha and think about it.\n\n\n### Berkshire Hathaway, Dividends, and Long-Term Owners\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nHow should an investor evaluate owning shares of Berkshire Hathaway or Microsoft when they don't pay dividends to investors?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nThe question about evaluating Berkshire when it doesn't pay any dividends\u2014and it won't pay any dividends either. That's a promise I can keep. All you get with Berkshire: you stick it in your safe-deposit box and then every year you go down and fondle it. You take it out and fondle it, then you put it back. There's enormous psychic reward in that. Don't underestimate it.\n\nBut the real question is whether we can keep retaining dollar bills and turning them into more than a dollar at a decent rate. That's what we try to do. Charlie Munger and I have our money in it to do that. That's all we'll get paid for doing. We won't take any options, we won't take any salaries to speak of, or anything. We ride around in the plane. But that's what we're trying to do. It gets harder all the time. The more money we manage, the harder it is to do that. We would do way better percentage-wise with Berkshire if it was one one-hundredth the present size.\n\nBut it is run for its owners. It isn't run to give them dividends, because so far every dollar that we've earned and could have paid out, we've turned into more than a dollar. It's worth more than a dollar to keep it. Therefore it would be silly to pay it out, even if everybody was tax-free that owned it. It would have been a mistake to pay dividends at Berkshire, because so far the dollar bills retained have turned into more than a dollar. There's no guarantee that that happens in the future. At some point the game runs out on that.\n\nBut that is the goal of\u2026 that is what the business is about. Nothing else about the business do we judge ourselves by. We don't judge it by the size of its home office building or the number of people working around it. We've got 12 people at headquarters. We've got 45,000 employees at Berkshire and 12 people at headquarters in 3,500 square feet, and we won't change it. We will judge ourselves by the performance of the company, and that's the only way we'll get paid. Believe me, it's a lot harder than it used to be.\n\n\n### When to Sell: Owning Businesses Forever\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nWhat makes you decide that one of your investments has reached its full potential, as you said earlier?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nIdeally, you buy businesses where you feel that will never happen. I don't buy Coke with the idea that it's going to be out of gas in ten or fifteen years. I mean, something could happen, but I would think the chances of that are almost nil.\n\nWhat we really want to do is buy businesses that we would be happy to own forever. It's the same way I feel about people who buy Berkshire. I want people to buy Berkshire that plan to hold it forever. They may not, for one reason or another, but I want them, at the time they buy it, to think they are buying a business that they're going to own forever. I don't say that's the only way to buy things; it's just that that's the group I want to have join me, because I don't want to have a changing group all the time.\n\nI measure Berkshire by how little activity there is in it. If I had a church and I was the preacher and half the congregation left every Sunday, I wouldn't say, \"Oh, this is marvelous, because I have all this liquidity among my members. This is terrific turnover.\" I would rather get a church where all the seats are filled every Sunday by the same people.\n\nThat's the way we look at the businesses we buy. We want to buy something that we're really happy to own virtually forever. We can't find a lot of those. Back when I started, I had way more ideas than money, so I was just constantly having to sell what I thought was the least attractive stock in order to buy something that I had just discovered that looked even cheaper. That's not our problem now.\n\nWe hope we're buying businesses that we're just as happy with five years from now as now. If we ever found some huge acquisition, then we'd have to sell something, maybe, to make that acquisition. That would be a very pleasant problem to have.\n\nWe never buy something with a price target in mind. We never buy something at 30 saying, \"If it goes to 40, we'll sell it,\" or 50 or 60 or 100. We just don't do it that way, any more than when we buy a private business like See's Candy for $25 million, we don't say to ourselves, \"If we ever got an offer of $50 million for this business, we'd sell it.\" That's just not the way to look at a business. The way to look at a business is: is this going to keep producing more and more money over time? If the answer to that is yes, you don't need to ask any more questions.\n\n\n### Salomon, Long-Term Capital, and Arbitrage\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nFor taking Salomon and, similarly, Long-Term Capital, how did you come up with valuation?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nSalomon, like I said, I went into that because it was a 9% security. In September 1987 the Dow was up 35% that year. We'd sold a lot of stuff and I had a lot of money around. It looked to me like we were never getting a chance to do anything, so I took an attractive security form in a business I would never buy the common stock of. I went in because of that, and I think that's generally a mistake. It worked out okay finally on that, but it's not what I should have been doing. I either should have waited\u2014in which case I could have bought more Coca-Cola a year later thereabouts\u2014or I should have even bought Coke at the prices it was selling at then, even though it was selling at a pretty good price at the time. That was a mistake.\n\nOn Long-Term Capital, we have learned other businesses that are associated with securities over the years. One of them is arbitrage. I've done arbitrage for 45 years, and Graham did it for probably 30 years before that. That business, unfortunately, I have to be near a phone for, and I have to really run out of the office myself, because it requires being more sort of market-attuned, and I don't want to do that anymore. Unless a really big arbitrage situation came along that I understood, I won't be doing much of that. But I've probably been in 300 arbitrage situations at least in my life, maybe more, and it's been a good business, a perfectly good business.\n\nLong-Term Capital has a bunch of positions. They've got tons of positions, but the top ten are probably 90% of the money that's at risk. I know something about those ten positions. I don't know everything about them by a long shot, but I know enough where I would feel okay, at a big discount, going in. We would have the staying power to hold it out. We might lose money on something like that, but the odds are with us. That's a game that I understand.\n\nThere are a few other positions we have that aren't that big, because they can't get that big, but they could involve yield-curve relationships or on-the-run/off-the-run governments or things like that that are just things you learn over time if you're around securities markets. They're not the base of our business. On average they've accounted for maybe a half a percentage point of our return a year, or three-quarters of a percentage point a year. They're little pluses that you get for actually having just been around a long time and learning a little bit.\n\nThe first arbitrage I did\u2014not the first, but one of the first\u2014involved a company where they were offering cocoa beans in exchange for their stock. That was in 1955. I bought the stock, turned in the stock, got warehouse certificates for cocoa beans, and they happened to be a different type than those trading on the Cocoa Exchange, but there was a basis differential in my favor and I sold them. That's just something I was around at the time so I learned about. There hasn't been a cocoa bean deal since. In 40-odd years I've been waiting for another cocoa bean deal, I haven't seen it. But it's there in my memory if it ever comes along. Long-Term Capital is that on a big scale.\n\n\n### Diversification vs. Concentration\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nThe question is about diversification.\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nI've got a dual answer to that. If you are not a professional investor\u2014if your goal is not to manage money in such a way as to get a significantly better return than the world\u2014then I believe in extreme diversification. I believe 98 or 99%, maybe more than 99%, of people who invest should extensively diversify and not trade. That leads them to an index-fund type of decision with very low costs, because all they're going to do is own a part of America. They've made a decision that owning a part of America is worthwhile. I don't quarrel with that at all. That is the way they should approach it, unless they want to bring an intensity to the game, to make a decision and start evaluating businesses.\n\nOnce you're in the business of evaluating businesses, and you decide that you're going to bring the effort and intensity and time involved to get that job done, then I think that diversification is a terrible mistake to any degree. I got asked that question when I was at SunTrust the other day. If you really know businesses, you probably shouldn't own more than six of them. If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need, and you're going to make a lot of money. I will guarantee you that going into a seventh one, rather than putting more money in your first one, has got to be a terrible mistake.\n\nVery few people have gotten rich on their seventh-best idea, but a lot of people have gotten rich on their best idea. For anybody working with normal capital who really knows the businesses they've gone into, six is plenty. I'd probably have half of it in what I liked best.\n\nI don't diversify personally. All the people I know that have done well\u2014with the exception, we mentioned Walter Schloss here earlier\u2014Walter diversifies a lot. He owns a little of everything. I call him Noah. He's got two of everything.\n\n\n### Comparing Blue-Chip Consumer Businesses: Coke, P&G, McDonald\u2019s, Gillette\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nHow do you evaluate the Cokes of the world from the Procter & Gambles of the world?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nProcter & Gamble is a very, very good business. Strong distribution capability, lots of brand names and everything. But if you ask me: we're going to go away for 20 years, put all my family's net worth in one business, would I rather have Procter & Gamble or Coke? Actually, Procter & Gamble is a little more\u2026 you'd be more diversified on product line. But I would feel surer of Coke than Procter & Gamble.\n\nI wouldn't be unhappy if somebody told me I had to own Procter & Gamble during that 20-year period. That would be in my top 5%, because they are not going to get killed. But I would feel better about the unit growth and the pricing power of Coke over 20 or 30 years than I would about Procter & Gamble.\n\nRight now the pricing power might be tough, but think of a billion servings a day. An extra penny\u2014$10 million a day. We own 8% of it. That's $800,000 a day for Berkshire Hathaway\u2014if they get another penny out of the stuff. Doesn't seem impossible, does it? I mean, it's worth another penny. Right now it would be a mistake to try and get it in most markets, but over time Coke will make more per serving than it does now. Twenty years from now I'll guarantee they'll make more per serving. They'll be selling a whole lot more servings. I don't know how many, I don't know how much more, but I know that.\n\nProcter & Gamble's main products\u2014I don't think they have the kind of dominance, and they don't have the kind of unit growth. But they're good businesses. I would not be unhappy if you told me that I had to put my family's net worth in P&G and that was the only stock I could own. There might be some other names I prefer, but there aren't a hundred other names I would prefer.\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nSame question with McDonald's. If you go away 20 years, would you be comfortable with McDonald's?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nThe question is about McDonald's and going away for 20 years. McDonald's has got a lot of things going for it, particularly abroad. Their position abroad in many countries is stronger relatively than here. It's a tougher business. Over time, people do not want to eat at McDonald's every day\u2014with the exception of the kids when they're giving away Beanie Babies or something. People do not want to eat at McDonald's every day. If people are drinking Coke today and drink five of them today, they'll probably drink five tomorrow. The fast-food business is tougher than that.\n\nIf you had to pick one hand to have in the fast-food business, which is going to be a huge business worldwide, you'd pick McDonald's. It has the strongest position. It doesn't win taste tests with adults. It does very well with children and it does fine with adults, but it is not like it's a clear winner. It's gotten into the game in recent years of being more price-promotional\u2014you remember the experiment a year ago or so. It's gotten more dependent on that, rather than just selling the product by itself.\n\nI like a product that by itself sells. I feel better about Gillette if people buy the Mach 3 because they like the Mach 3 than if they get a Beanie Baby with it. I just think it's fundamentally a stronger product if that's the case. We own a lot of Gillette, and you can sleep pretty well at night if you think of a couple of billion men with their hair growing on their faces. It's growing all night while you sleep. Women have two legs\u2014it's even better. It beats counting sheep.\n\nThose are the kinds of businesses I like. If you've got to think, \"What promotion am I going to put out there against Burger King next month, and what if they sign up Disney and I don't get Disney?\"\u2014I like the products that stand alone absent promotional price appeals. Although you can build a very good business based on that, and McDonald's is a terrific business, it's not as good a business as Coke. There really hardly is any that's as good as Coke. But it's a very good business. If you bet on one company in that field\u2014aside from Dairy Queen, of course\u2014it would be McDonald's. We bought Dairy Queen here a while back; that's why I'm plugging it shamelessly.\n\n\n### Electric Utilities and Real Estate/REITs\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nWhat do you think of the electric utility industry?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nI've thought about that a lot, because you can put big money in it, and I've even thought of buying entire businesses. There's a fellow in Omaha actually that's done a little of that through CalEnergy. But I don't quite understand the game in terms of how it's going to develop with deregulation. I can see how it destroys a lot of value for the high-cost producer once they're not protected by a monopoly territory. I don't for sure see who benefits and how much.\n\nObviously the guy with very low-cost power\u2014some guy that's got hydro power at two cents a kilowatt or something like that\u2014has got a huge advantage. But how much of that he's going to get to keep, or how extensively he can send that outside his natural territory, I haven't been able to figure out so that I really think I know what the industry's going to look like in ten years. It is something I think about, and if I ever develop any insights that call for action, I will act on them. I think I can understand the attractiveness of the product and all the aspects of certainty of user need, and the fact that it's a bargain and all of that I understand. I just don't understand who's going to make the money ten years from now, and that keeps me away.\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nYou mentioned earlier that in buying stock almost every company's public, and until the last five years real estate has been primarily private. We're now seeing a great securitization of real estate. What are your insights into the industry?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nIf you leave out the corporate form, real estate has been a lousy way to own equities, because you've interjected a corporate income tax into something that people individually have been able to own with a single tax. By having the normal corporate form you get a double taxation you really don't need with real estate. It takes away too much of the return.\n\nREITs have, in effect, created a conduit so that you don't get the double taxation, but they also generally have fairly high operating expenses. If you can buy fairly simple types of real estate on an 8% yield or thereabouts, and you take away maybe close to one or one and a half percent by the time you count stock options and everything, it's not a terribly attractive way to own it. It may be the only way a guy with a thousand bucks or five thousand bucks can own it, but if you have a million or ten million, you're better off owning the real properties yourself than sticking some intermediary in between that will get a sizable piece of the return for himself.\n\nWe have found very little in that field. You'll see an announcement in the next couple of weeks that may belie what I'm telling you here on one thing, so I don't want you to think I was double-crossing you. But generally speaking, we've seen very, very little in that field that gets us excited.\n\nPeople sometimes get very confused. They'll look at some huge land company\u2014I'll take one that won't evoke any emotional reactions on the part of anybody\u2014like Texas Pacific Land Trust, which has been around over a hundred years and has got a couple of million acres in Texas. They'll sell 1% of their land every year, and they'll take that as applying to everything and come up with some huge value compared to the market value. That's nonsense. If you really own the property, you know you can't move 50% of the properties or 20% of the properties. It's way worse than an illiquid stock.\n\nYou get these, I think, very silly valuations placed on a lot of real-estate companies by people that don't really understand what it's like to own one and try to move large quantities of property. REITs have behaved terribly in the market this year, as you know. It's not at all inconceivable they would become a class that would get so unpopular that they would sell at significant discounts from what you could sell the properties for. They could get interesting as a class then, and then the question is whether the management would fight you in that process, because they would be giving up their income stream for managing things, and their interests might run counter to the shareholders on that.\n\nI've always wondered about the REITs that say, \"Our assets are so wonderful and they're so cheap,\" and then they go out and sell stock. There's a contradiction in that. If they say, \"Our stock at 28 is very cheap,\" and then they sell a lot of stock at 28, less the underwriting commission, there's a disconnect there.\n\nIt's a field we look at. Charlie and I can understand real estate, and we would be open for very big transactions periodically. If there were a Long-Term Capital Management situation translated to real estate, we would be open to that. The trouble is so many other people would be too that it would be unlikely to go at a price that would really get us excited.\n\n\n### Stock Market Fluctuations and Why Investors Should Prefer Lower Prices\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nUnderstanding your theory that sort of a down market is good for net savers, can you give us your thoughts as to where the market's going, its downward trend and long-term profit?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nI've got no idea where the market's going to go. I prefer it going down, but my preferences have nothing to do with it. The market knows nothing about my feelings. That's one of the first things you have to learn. You buy 100 shares of General Motors; now all of a sudden you have this feeling about General Motors. If it goes down, you may be mad at it. You may say, \"If it'd just go up to what I paid for it, my life will be wonderful again.\" Or if it goes up, you may say how smart you were and how you and General Motors have this love affair.\n\nThe stock doesn't know you own it. The stock just sits there. It doesn't care what you paid, it doesn't care that you own it, or anything. Any feeling I have about the market is not reciprocated. It is the ultimate cold shoulder we're talking about here.\n\nAnybody who is going to be a net saver\u2014practically everybody in this room is more likely to be a net buyer of stocks over the next ten years than they are a net seller\u2014so every one of you should prefer lower prices. If you're going to be a net eater of hamburger in the next ten years, you want hamburger to go down, unless you're a cattle producer. If you're going to be a buyer of Coca-Cola and you don't own Coke stock, you hope the price of Coke goes down. You're looking for it to be on sale this weekend at your supermarket. You want it to be down on the weekends, not up on the weekends when you're going to the supermarket.\n\nYour stock exchange is a big supermarket of companies, and you're going to be buying stocks. What do you want to have happen? You want those stocks to go down, way down. You will make better buys then. Later on, 20 or 30 years from now, when you're in a period when you're dissaving, or when your heirs are dissaving for you\u2014you're gone\u2014then you may care about higher prices.\n\nThere's a chapter eight in Ben Graham's *The Intelligent Investor* about the attitude toward stock market fluctuations, and then the chapter 20 on the margin of safety. Those are the two most important essays ever written on investing, as far as I'm concerned. When I read chapter eight when I was 19, I figured out what I just said. It's obvious. I didn't figure it out myself; it was explained to me. I probably would have gone another hundred years and still thought it was good when my stocks were going up.\n\nWe want things to go down. But I have no idea what the stock market's going to do. I never do, never will. It's not something that I think about at all. When it goes down, I look harder at what I might buy that day, because I know there's more likely to be some merchandise there that I can use my money effectively in.\n\n\n### Closing Reflections: The Ovarian Lottery and Designing a Just World\n\n**Moderator:**  \nOkay Warren, we'll take one more question from the audience.\n\n**Warren Buffett:**  \nOkay, I'll let you pick who gets it, then you can be the guy.\n\n**Audience Member:**  \nIf you may again study your life again, then what would you like to do to have a happier life?\n\n**Warren Buffett:**\n\nThe question is what would I do if I were going to live over again and have a happier life. The only thing I might do is select a gene pool where people live to be 120 or something. I've been extraordinarily lucky.\n\nI use this example. Let's assume it was 24 hours before you were born and a genie came to you and he said, \"Herb, you look very promising, and I've got a big problem. I've got to design the world in which you're going to live.\" Then he says, \"I've decided, the hell with it, it's too tough. You design it. So you've got 24 hours. You figure out what the social rules should be, the economic rules, the governmental rules, and you're going to live under those, and your kids are going to live under them, and their kids are going to live under them.\"\n\nYou say, \"I can design anything?\" And the genie says, \"Yeah, you can do it.\" And you say, \"Well, there must be a catch.\" He says, \"Well, there is a catch. You don't know whether you're going to be born black or white, rich or poor, male or female, infirm or able-bodied, bright or not so bright. All you know is you're going to take one ball out of a barrel that's got 5.8 billion balls in it. You're going to participate in what I call the ovarian lottery. You're going to get one ball out of there, and that is the most important thing that's ever going to happen to you in your life, because that is going to control whether you're born here or in Afghanistan, whether you're born with an IQ of 130 or an IQ of 70. It's going to determine a whole lot. You're going to go out in the world and you're going to have that ball.\"\n\nNow, what kind of a world do you want to design? I think that's a good way to look at social questions, because not knowing which ball you're going to get, you're going to want a system that produces lots of goods and services, because you're going to want people on balance to live well. You're going to want one that produces more and more so your kids live better than you do and your grandchildren live better than the kids. But you're also going to want a system that, if it does produce lots of goods and services, does not leave behind a person that accidentally got the wrong ball and is not well wired for this particular system.\n\nI'm ideally wired for the system I fell into here. I came out and I got something that enables me to allocate capital. There's nothing so wonderful about that. If all of us were stranded on a desert island\u2014we all landed there and we were never going to get off of it\u2014the most valuable person would be the one that could raise the most rice over time. I could say, \"I'm going to allocate capital,\" and you'd say, \"How about paying me?\" and you wouldn't get very excited about that. So I am in the right place.\n\nGates says if I'd been born a few million years ago I'd have been some animal's lunch. He says, \"You can't run very fast, you can't climb trees, you can't do anything. You'd just have been chewed up on the first day.\" He says, \"You're lucky you were born today.\" And I am.\n\nOne question you can ask yourself, incidentally, is: here is this barrel with 5.8 billion balls\u2014everybody in the world. If you could put your ball back and then they took out, at random, a hundred other balls and you had to pick one of those, would you put your ball back in? Now, of those hundred balls that you're going to get out, roughly five of them will be American, so there are 95 versus five. You're only going to have five balls if you want to be in this country. Half of them are going to be women, half of them are going to be men. I'll let you decide how you vote on that one. Half of them are going to be below-average intelligence, half are going to be above.\n\nDo you want to put your ball back? Most of you, I think, would not want to put that ball back to get a hundred. What you're saying is, \"I'm in the luckiest 1% of the world right now, sitting in this room. I'm in the top 1% of the world.\" That's the way I feel. I've been lucky to be born where I was, because it was 50 to 1 against me being in the United States when I was born. Lucky with parents, lucky with all kinds of things. Then lucky to be wired in a way that in a market economy pays off like crazy for me. It doesn't pay off for somebody who's absolutely as good a citizen as I am\u2014leading Boy Scout troops, teaching Sunday school, raising fine families\u2014but just doesn't happen to be wired in the same way I am.\n\nSo I've been extremely lucky. I'd like to be lucky again. If I'm lucky, then the way to do it is to play out that game and do something you enjoy all your life and be associated with people you like. I only work with people I like. If I could make a hundred million by buying a business with some guy that caused my stomach to churn, I'd say no, because I'd say that's just like marrying for money, which probably isn't a very good idea in any circumstances, but if you're already rich it's crazy. I'm not going to marry for money.\n\nSo I would do almost exactly what I've done\u2014except I don't think I would have bought the U.S. Air.\n\nThanks."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"f7ea9059-0129-4c8f-b49b-320b8cda670e","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"0c44d725-76a2-4867-a667-a279df926bb6"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d9617e2b-cae2-42d8-809f-b1892805ee38","children":["afeaf770-a226-4b2b-9bad-79e72829e125"]},"afeaf770-a226-4b2b-9bad-79e72829e125":{"id":"afeaf770-a226-4b2b-9bad-79e72829e125","message":{"id":"afeaf770-a226-4b2b-9bad-79e72829e125","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767675720.7608216,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"f7ea9059-0129-4c8f-b49b-320b8cda670e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"9605afe0-d40e-42cb-9feb-4538d1ac6c8e","turn_exchange_id":"0c44d725-76a2-4867-a667-a279df926bb6"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9605afe0-d40e-42cb-9feb-4538d1ac6c8e","children":["a0f39af7-3e76-4f7b-af4a-4a4754e8711f"]},"a0f39af7-3e76-4f7b-af4a-4a4754e8711f":{"id":"a0f39af7-3e76-4f7b-af4a-4a4754e8711f","message":{"id":"a0f39af7-3e76-4f7b-af4a-4a4754e8711f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767675720.873929,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"f7ea9059-0129-4c8f-b49b-320b8cda670e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"afeaf770-a226-4b2b-9bad-79e72829e125","turn_exchange_id":"0c44d725-76a2-4867-a667-a279df926bb6"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"afeaf770-a226-4b2b-9bad-79e72829e125","children":["9d013aed-97fd-4b71-b674-240d29e78f5e"]},"9d013aed-97fd-4b71-b674-240d29e78f5e":{"id":"9d013aed-97fd-4b71-b674-240d29e78f5e","message":{"id":"9d013aed-97fd-4b71-b674-240d29e78f5e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767675721.680738,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Critiquing Warren Buffett's speech","content":"The user wanted a critique of Warren Buffett\u2019s speech.

As a speech to MBA students it\u2019s effective. As a *general theory of investing and markets*, it\u2019s a mix of genuinely deep principles and oversimplifications that can mislead if taken literally.\n\nBelow is an honest critique, section by section.\n\n---\n\n## What the speech is trying to do (and why it works)\n\nHe\u2019s not giving a lecture in finance; he\u2019s shaping a *mental model* for decision-making:\n\n- **Character first** (integrity \u2192 long-run trust and opportunity set).\n- **Avoid ruin** (leverage + tail risk can erase decades of skill).\n- **Stay in your circle of competence** (know what you know).\n- **Prefer compounding machines** (durable advantages + time).\n- **Ignore noise** (especially macro forecasts and Wall Street stimulation).\n- **Take the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d seriously** (\u201covarian lottery\u201d \u2192 design a society you\u2019d accept not knowing your starting position).\n\nThat package is persuasive because it\u2019s internally coherent, emotionally resonant, and delivered in concrete images (moats, cigar butts, Russian roulette, fondling Berkshire certificates).\n\nThe danger is that coherence + charisma can make the claims feel more universal than they really are.\n\n---\n\n## 1) \u201cIntegrity, intelligence, energy\u201d + the \u201cbuy 10% of a classmate\u201d game\n\n**What\u2019s strong**\n- The \u201cbuy 10% / short 10%\u201d thought experiment is *excellent pedagogy*. It forces people to admit they don\u2019t actually prize IQ and hustle alone; they prize *trustworthiness, generosity, credit-giving, reliability*\u2014the social capital that compounds.\n- He makes a good point about **habit formation**: virtues and vices are path-dependent; it\u2019s easier to steer early.\n\n**What\u2019s weak / incomplete**\n- It\u2019s a bit *clean-room moral psychology*. Many career outcomes are shaped by structural constraints, incentives, and institutional culture. Integrity isn\u2019t just a personal choice; it can be punished in some environments unless governance and incentives support it.\n- He implies \u201cyou can just choose these traits,\u201d which is partly true for behavior, but less true for temperament, mental health, trauma, or chronic stress. The core message stands, but the \u201canyone can\u201d framing is too frictionless.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Japan and \u201cborrow at 1% for 10 years\u201d\n\n**What\u2019s strong**\n- He reduces the problem to a simple hurdle rate: if capital costs ~1%, you only need opportunities that reliably clear it *without hidden risks*. That\u2019s a disciplined way to think.\n- He focuses on **return on equity (ROE)** (how efficiently a firm turns shareholder capital into profit), which matters a lot in long-term compounding.\n\n**What\u2019s weak / incomplete**\n- He treats Japan\u2019s low ROE as almost destiny (\u201cculture might change\u201d). That\u2019s plausible, but it\u2019s also a classic trap: **macro/structural regimes do change** (governance reforms, buybacks, payout norms, competition policy). A low-ROE environment can still produce bargains if prices reflect pessimism.\n- He also frames \u201ccurrency risk\u201d as something to avoid, but in practice you can hedge (at a cost) and you can diversify exposures. He\u2019s selling a preference as a principle.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM): \u201csmart people did dumb things\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s making a *risk-of-ruin* argument: don\u2019t trade \u201csomething you need\u201d for a marginal upside you don\u2019t need.\n\n**What\u2019s strong**\n- The core lesson is real: **leverage turns small model error into existential risk**.\n- His Russian roulette analogy is basically an informal expected-utility argument where \u201cutility of survival\u201d is non-linear and bankruptcy is catastrophic.\n- His best line here is: *\u201cto make money they didn\u2019t have and didn\u2019t need, they risked what they did have and did need.\u201d* That\u2019s a good heuristic for personal finance and for institutional risk-taking.\n\n**Where he overreaches**\n- He takes a broad swipe at \u201cmathematics,\u201d \u201cbeta,\u201d and \u201csigmas.\u201d\n  - **Beta** (a measure of how a stock covaries with the market) is *not* a measure of bankruptcy risk, so his critique lands **against naive beta-as-risk**.\n  - But dismissing quantitative risk methods entirely is too far. The real problem wasn\u2019t \u201cmath\u201d; it was **model risk**, **fat tails** (financial returns are not well-described by a stable normal distribution), **liquidity risk**, and **crowded trades** interacting with leverage.\n- He implies the moral is \u201cavoid leverage,\u201d but there\u2019s nuance:\n  - Some leverage is structurally unavoidable (e.g., insurance float, banks, mortgages).\n  - The real principle is **avoid leverage that can force liquidation under stress** (maturity mismatch, margin calls, fragile funding).\n\n**Subtle contradiction**\n- He says, \u201cWe never basically borrow money,\u201d but Berkshire\u2019s **insurance float** is economically similar to borrowing: other people\u2019s money, invested for Berkshire\u2019s benefit, with obligations attached. It can be *very safe* if underwritten well, but it\u2019s still leverage-like. He downplays that because his version is long-duration and operationally controlled, but it\u2019s not \u201cno leverage.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4) \u201cMoats,\u201d brands, and simplicity (Coke, See\u2019s, Wrigley, Kodak)\n\n**What\u2019s strong**\n- \u201cMoat\u201d is a powerful abstraction for durable competitive advantage: cost advantage, brand, switching costs, distribution, network effects, regulation, location, patents, etc.\n- He\u2019s excellent on **pricing power**: the difference between \u201cI need promotions to move product\u201d versus \u201cthe product sells itself.\u201d\n- The \u201cshare of mind\u201d framing is insightful. Brand isn\u2019t just awareness; it\u2019s default choice under uncertainty and limited attention.\n\n**Where it can mislead**\n- **Moats are often invisible *until they aren\u2019t*.** He acknowledges moats can narrow, but his tone still leans toward \u201cthe great ones stay great.\u201d History is less forgiving: consumer behavior shifts, technology shifts, regulation shifts, health norms shift.\n- His Kodak example is interesting because it\u2019s a warning about moat erosion\u2014but it also shows the limitation of the whole approach: sometimes the \u201cmoat\u201d is sitting on top of a technological discontinuity that destroys the profit pool.\n- \u201cSimple business\u201d is a preference, not a proof of safety. Plenty of \u201csimple\u201d businesses get disrupted (retail, newspapers, taxis). Simplicity helps *understanding*; it doesn\u2019t guarantee durability.\n\n**The Coke \u201cno taste memory\u201d claim**\n- It\u2019s rhetorically brilliant, but scientifically and behaviorally it\u2019s overstated. People absolutely do develop taste fatigue and shifting preferences, and public health trends matter. The *directional* point\u2014habitual consumption supports volume\u2014is fair; the categorical phrasing is marketing-grade certainty.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Valuation and the qualitative/quantitative split\n\n**What\u2019s strong**\n- He emphasizes that valuation is inseparable from *business understanding*.\n- His See\u2019s Candy story is a clean illustration of pricing power and capital-light economics.\n\n**What\u2019s weak**\n- The \u201cwe decide in five minutes\u201d trope is inspirational but dangerous as advice. It works for someone with:\n  - decades of pattern recognition,\n  - privileged access to information and deal flow,\n  - a reputation that changes seller behavior,\n  - and the ability to do bespoke transactions.\n- For normal investors, \u201cfive minutes\u201d becomes an excuse for overconfidence. Most people *think* they\u2019re inside their circle of competence when they\u2019re not.\n\n---\n\n## 6) \u201cIgnore macro forecasts completely\u201d\n\n**What\u2019s strong**\n- Macro forecasting is genuinely hard; most forecasts are noise, and acting on them often increases turnover and fees.\n- For very long holding periods, business quality usually dominates short-run macro fluctuations.\n\n**What\u2019s incomplete**\n- \u201cMacro doesn\u2019t matter\u201d is too absolute. Macro variables (rates, inflation regimes, regulation, geopolitics) can:\n  - change discount rates (valuation),\n  - change competitive dynamics,\n  - change bankruptcy probabilities,\n  - and reshape entire industries.\n- The better version is: **macro is hard to forecast, so don\u2019t pretend you can**, but still stress-test your holdings for macro-sensitive failure modes (funding costs, demand shocks, currency mismatches).\n\n---\n\n## 7) Diversification: index funds for most; concentration for professionals\n\n**What\u2019s strong**\n- His advice for most people\u2014low-cost index funds, low turnover\u2014is excellent.\n- He correctly points out that over-diversification can turn skill into \u201cindex + fees.\u201d\n\n**What\u2019s overstated**\n- \u201cIf you really know businesses you shouldn\u2019t own more than six\u201d and \u201cthe seventh is a terrible mistake\u201d is rhetorical absolutism.\n  - Concentration increases **idiosyncratic risk** (risk specific to one company).\n  - Even skilled investors face model error and unknown unknowns.\n- A more defensible view: concentrate **only to the extent your edge is real and your downside is survivable**.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Career advice: \u201ctake the job you love\u201d\n\n**What\u2019s strong**\n- It\u2019s psychologically correct: compounding applies to skills and motivation too. If you love the work, you do more reps, and you get better.\n- The r\u00e9sum\u00e9/consulting line (\u201csaving up sex for old age\u201d) is memorable and, for many MBAs, probably needed.\n\n**What\u2019s missing**\n- This advice assumes you have a safety net (family support, low obligations, good health). Many people must optimize for stability first.\n- The more universal version: **optimize early for learning rate and long-run optionality, not short-run prestige**\u2014but sometimes stability is the precondition for that.\n\n---\n\n## 9) The closing: \u201covarian lottery\u201d and designing a just world\n\nThis is the most philosophically serious part.\n\n**What\u2019s strong**\n- It\u2019s basically John Rawls\u2019 \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d translated into Buffett\u2019s language.\n- He acknowledges luck and \u201cbeing wired for the system\u201d as morally arbitrary, which is unusually candid for an ultra-wealthy capitalist.\n- He argues for a system that is both productive **and** doesn\u2019t abandon those who draw a bad lot\u2014an implicit case for some redistribution and strong institutions.\n\n**What\u2019s weak**\n- He stops at the parable and avoids specifics\u2014tax policy, education, healthcare, labor power, antitrust, political capture. That\u2019s understandable in a speech, but it makes the conclusion feel like moral sentiment rather than actionable design.\n- There\u2019s also a tension: he frames himself as \u201cjust lucky,\u201d which is partly true, but it can underplay how wealth also compounds through power, access, and institutional influence.\n\n---\n\n## The best parts (worth keeping)\n\n- **Avoid ruin**: if you can\u2019t survive tail outcomes, your skill doesn\u2019t matter.\n- **Circle of competence**: know what you know; don\u2019t outsource conviction to gossip or charts.\n- **Time + great economics** beats cleverness: compounding is king.\n- **Most people should index**: low fees, low turnover, own productive capacity.\n- **Character compounds**: reputation is a hidden asset that expands your opportunity set.\n\n## The parts to treat as \u201cBuffett rhetoric,\u201d not universal law\n\n- \u201cMacro never matters.\u201d\n- \u201cQuant metrics tell you nothing.\u201d\n- \u201cFive minutes is enough.\u201d\n- \u201cSix stocks is optimal; the seventh is a mistake.\u201d\n- \u201cBrand moats are basically permanent.\u201d\n- \u201cNo taste memory\u201d / overly categorical consumer claims.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me what you want the critique to optimize for\u2014**investment theory**, **rhetoric/persuasion**, or **philosophical/social claims**\u2014I can sharpen it in that direction."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"f7ea9059-0129-4c8f-b49b-320b8cda670e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"a1634c0b-cbac-49bc-ad89-32e57f12f626","turn_exchange_id":"0c44d725-76a2-4867-a667-a279df926bb6"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"a1634c0b-cbac-49bc-ad89-32e57f12f626","children":[]}}}
