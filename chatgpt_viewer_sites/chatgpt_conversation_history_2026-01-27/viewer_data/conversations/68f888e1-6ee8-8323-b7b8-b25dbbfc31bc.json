This directive follows a Reuters investigation revealing Foxconn's previous exclusion of married women from these roles, which contradicted anti-discrimination policies of both Foxconn and Apple. Previously, Foxconn\u2019s recruitment ads specified that only unmarried women within certain age ranges were eligible, especially contravening during high production periods. The company has now standardized its recruitment materials without discriminative criteria and benefits like free transport and hostel facilities. Despite these changes, it remains unclear if Foxconn has genuinely adopted inclusive hiring practices. Following the revelations, India's government initiated investigations into Foxconn's hiring practices, yet the outcomes of these probes have not been disclosed. Foxconn and Apple have not commented on these recent developments.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1731903465.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f8893c1f94832c8663ca572b3a6a44","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for TAFEP guidelines and fair employment practices","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"526bc46d-bc26-4cc2-b044-fa3d139e1db8","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"ad06fd55-dfb1-46f1-85d4-8759f49805af","turn_exchange_id":"cdb68fdb-7e52-48a9-bd98-ad97bf2c609c","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ad06fd55-dfb1-46f1-85d4-8759f49805af","children":["81aaf0be-710f-482c-a4ca-eb7ffd3de2f0"]},"81aaf0be-710f-482c-a4ca-eb7ffd3de2f0":{"id":"81aaf0be-710f-482c-a4ca-eb7ffd3de2f0","message":{"id":"81aaf0be-710f-482c-a4ca-eb7ffd3de2f0","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761118599.439133,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Additional points to cover","content":"We don't need Reuters for fairness, so I'll stick with MOM/TAFEP.
