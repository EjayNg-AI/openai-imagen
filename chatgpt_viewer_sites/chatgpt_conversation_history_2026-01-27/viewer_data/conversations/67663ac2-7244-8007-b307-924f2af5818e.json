Where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire.\r\nI learned throughout my career that when top talent starts jumping ship, it\u2019s time to head for the doors. The rockstars and linchpins in a company are the canary in the coalmine. When they lose faith in the business\u2019s leadership, they are the first to go. Why? Usually, they have a central role and higher visibility. I call this the \u201cburden of competence.\u201d They are the prime movers in the company, so they see more than most. Furthermore, the fact that they are top talent means they are highly portable. Talent poaching is very real, and actually a deliberate function of the market. Neoliberal theory says that if a company is struggling, the market should punish that company, or even kill it. A mobile labor force is just one way that the market can create eternal churn and growth. Competition baby! Adapt or die!\r\n\r\nThe opposite is also true; it\u2019s a good sign when dead weight is leaving a company. Here are a couple quick examples from my career.\r\n\r\nSaul was a key player at a midsized MSP (managed service provider) I worked at. He had the Midas touch. When Saul showed up, everything went smoothly. The ship just didn\u2019t run right without him around. So on the day that he showed up, fully erect posture, and a goofy grin plastered on his face, I knew something was up. This was the smile of liberation. He\u2019d just gotten a job offer from the slick competitor, a league above us. My first thought was \u201cOh fuck, now what?\u201d I should have started spamming my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that day. But I\u2019m a slow learner.\r\n\r\nConversely, at another job, a midlevel senior manager started getting pissy with me. He was dumping work on me that was his responsibility, and just generally causing chaos. My boss intervened and told him to back off. Dave is mine. But Steve wasn\u2019t done. He kept throwing wrenches in our gears, and I had a one-on-one call with another coworker, someone who\u2019d been at the company more than 30 years. \u201cSteve is a asshole!\u201d He declared, fuming. I pointed out, \u201cSteve is manipulative.\u201d And my coworker lit up \u201cYes! That\u2019s exactly right!\u201d A year later, months after Steve quit the company, I\u2019d learn that he\u2019d been angling for my boss\u2019s job, but was denied because he was a shifty twerp. When the bozos and clowns are leaving a company, that\u2019s a sign that the culture is improving.\r\n\r\nThe fact that OpenAI has lost a huge amount of their most visible talent, to me, is a strong indicator that things are not all right in Eden. That alone should tell you something, but I suspect there\u2019s another factor at play, and it has to do with simple rules shaping market dynamics.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Revamps Non-Compete Bans\r\nCalifornia has had a ban on non-compete agreements for a long time. However, in 2023, they introduced two new bills that revamp, reassert, and most importantly, expand the reach of their non-compete ban. Those two bills are Senate Bill 699 (SB 699) and Assembly Bill 1076 (AB 1076). Here\u2019s a high level of what they do:\r\n\r\nSenate Bill 699 (SB 699), which took effect on January 1, 2024, significantly strengthened California\u2019s existing ban on noncompete agreements. It declared that any contract voided under California's noncompete prohibition is unenforceable regardless of where and when it was signed, effectively extending the ban\u2019s reach to out-of-state agreements. SB 699 also established a private right of action for employees, allowing them to seek injunctive relief and actual damages, plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs, if an employer attempts to enforce a void noncompete agreement.\r\n\r\nAs if that wasn\u2019t spicy enough:\r\n\r\nAssembly Bill 1076 (AB 1076), also effective from January 1, 2024, codified existing case law by explicitly making it unlawful to include noncompete clauses in employment contracts or require employees to enter noncompete agreements, unless they fall under specific statutory exceptions. Crucially, AB 1076 mandates that employers must notify current employees and former employees (employed after January 1, 2022) in writing by February 14, 2024, that any noncompete agreements or clauses they may have signed are void under California law. This notification must be sent to the employee\u2019s last known postal and email addresses. Failure to provide this notice constitutes an act of unfair competition and may result in penalties of up to $2,500 per violation.\r\n\r\nWhen you combine this with the embarrassment of OpenAI\u2019s deeply problematic \u201cclawback\u201d clause coming to light, the net effect is that a lot of OpenAI employees were liberated from draconian laws and reminded that they had rights.\r\n\r\nr/singularity - Altman talking on equity.\r\nYou know it\u2019s embarrassing when the CEO has to tweet about it. You think he didn\u2019t know?\r\nQuite a few former OpenAI employees have moved onwards and upwards. This is to be expected\u2014people learn and grow, and when they are qualified for a better job, they are liable to take one. In some cases, though, they\u2019ve gone on to start rival companies. Anthropic, one of their chief rivals, was spawned by former OpenAI employees. Ilya Sutskever\u2019s SSI, Inc. likewise came from a high level departure. In both cases, it was over a difference in vision. More recently, Mira Murati, whose pedigree includes Tesla, departed and is now building a new startup. All of these folks have attracted massive investment.\r\n\r\nPlenty of other people, from lead researchers to safety specialists, have departed, citing a difference of opinion with respect to safety, ethics, and research directions. Some of that could be explained by OpenAI recently partnering with Anduril, a high-tech military/weapons company. Many people in tech have some high-minded values around the Military Industrial Complex, which is somewhat ironic to me. All of Silicon Valley serves as an appendage of the MIC. But I digress.\r\n\r\nLabor Movement, Market Wins\r\nNeoliberalism is an economic doctrine which places, at it\u2019s heart, market primacy. Many capitalists mistakenly believe that we should favor business above all else. Others, such as UK\u2019s Labour party, believe we should prioritize labor rights above all else. A true neoliberal, however, will recognize that neither side is right, not entirely. We should favor the market above all else. Sometimes that means taking rights from workers to rebalance the market, such as by dissolving unions. In other cases, it means taking rights away from businesses, such as by banning noncompete clauses.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s examine the aggregate effect of all these high level departures from OpenAI to see the wisdom in emphasizing market primacy over business primacy or worker primacy.\r\n\r\nMany new startups are forming, which is good for competition. Competition is good for everyone, in this case. The consumers win, the government wins, the economy wins. The brain drain from OpenAI represents a very steep gradient of talent reallocating itself across the market, allowing the market itself to explore more business paradigms, technical strategies, and market niches. Keeping talent locked up inside one company might have been better for that one company, but this alternative is better for everyone.\r\n\r\nTop talent is circulating to other companies, such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, and more. The revolving door phenomenon is an open secret that in the tech world. People come and go, finding a place where their talent and values align better with companies. You get boomerang effects. This is good for workers, but it\u2019s also good for companies engaging in talent poaching, they get to circulate that tribal knowledge, making the whole market more dynamic and productive.\r\n\r\nMoney and VC are flowing in like mad. When Mira left OpenAI, she had investors banging on her door immediately. Ilya quickly raised capital with a billion dollar valuation. There is always opportunity in chaos, and with latent talent and potential now liberated, America is in an even stronger position globally. Sure, OpenAI was the darling, but wouldn\u2019t it better if we had a dozen OpenAI\u2019s instead of just one?\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s good for America is not always what\u2019s best for an individual company. Likewise, what\u2019s best for America is sometimes at odds with individual workers. I\u2019m not expressly endorsing the system as-is, I\u2019m merely characterizing how it works and why this is the current philosophy. I do personally celebrate every time someone leaves OpenAI, as I still feel betrayed by their decision to go closed-source and maximum-profit. I was an early adopter and advocate, and I think the market is rightly punishing them for Sam\u2019s decision to upend his values and mission. The is-ought problem still applies here. I\u2019m merely observing how the world is, while avoid prescriptions of how it ought to be. I have had my criticisms of both neoliberalism and capitalism, but I also try to remain grounded in reality. It\u2019s a complex, messy world. It is far from ideal.\r\n\r\nBut at least in this one case, I see the absolute beauty of simple rules as high-leverage interventions which are potentially having outsized impacts on market dynamics.\r\n\r\nBefore we close out, I will say that there are certainly many reasons that people choose to leave companies. Value misalignments, better opportunities, burnout\u2014I\u2019m not trying to say that a pair of California bills are solely responsible. At the same time, I do appreciate the intention and apparent impact that these bills have had, and want to emphasize this as an example of a high-leverage intervention\u2014a simple rule change that can have a butterfly effect on the fate of a nation."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8f54e6d62d87405a-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0933d848-22e6-4983-ad7f-7d2915add42e","children":["f5270f87-80b8-4629-825e-941c1c8941cd"]},"f5270f87-80b8-4629-825e-941c1c8941cd":{"id":"f5270f87-80b8-4629-825e-941c1c8941cd","message":{"id":"f5270f87-80b8-4629-825e-941c1c8941cd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1734752975.837287,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa29243-ab14-4cac-afc7-a000c6779a27","request_id":"8f54e6d62d87405a-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa29243-ab14-4cac-afc7-a000c6779a27","children":["5d660672-1994-40d2-8635-1c7fcf00e623"]},"5d660672-1994-40d2-8635-1c7fcf00e623":{"id":"5d660672-1994-40d2-8635-1c7fcf00e623","message":{"id":"5d660672-1994-40d2-8635-1c7fcf00e623","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1734752975.837468,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### Summary:\n\n1. **Key Indicators of Company Health**:\n   - The departure of top talent signals deeper issues within a company, as they often have more visibility and portability. Their exits can indicate a lack of faith in leadership or strategic direction.\n   - Conversely, the departure of underperformers or disruptive employees can be a positive sign, reflecting cultural or structural improvement.\n\n2. **OpenAI\u2019s Challenges**:\n   - High-profile departures, such as Mira Murati and Ilya Sutskever, signal internal dissatisfaction or misalignment over vision, ethics, and strategy. \n   - Former employees have started rival companies (e.g., Anthropic, SSI, Inc.), attracting substantial investments and further diversifying market competition.\n   - Partnering with Anduril (a military company) has reportedly caused ethical concerns among some employees, leading to exits.\n\n3. **California\u2019s Expanded Non-Compete Ban**:\n   - **Senate Bill 699 (SB 699)**: Strengthened the non-compete ban by invalidating agreements regardless of location or timing, granting employees the right to seek damages if such clauses are enforced.\n   - **Assembly Bill 1076 (AB 1076)**: Mandates employer notification to current and former employees about the void nature of non-competes and penalizes non-compliance.\n   - These bills likely empowered OpenAI employees to leave for better opportunities or launch startups.\n\n4. **Neoliberal Market Dynamics**:\n   - Neoliberal philosophy prioritizes market dynamics over business or labor primacy, fostering competition and reallocation of talent.\n   - The brain drain from OpenAI has invigorated the market, leading to increased innovation and capital flow.\n   - Startups and rival firms benefit from the redistribution of talent, creating a more dynamic and competitive ecosystem.\n\n5. **Market Impact**:\n   - Talent circulation enriches the tech industry, promoting knowledge sharing and enhancing productivity across companies.\n   - Venture capital (VC) investments flow into startups led by former OpenAI talent, accelerating innovation and reinforcing America\u2019s global tech leadership.\n   - The decentralization of talent aligns with broader market dynamics, emphasizing adaptability and growth over monopolistic stability.\n\n6. **Personal Reflection**:\n   - The author critiques OpenAI for abandoning its open-source ethos and becoming profit-driven. They celebrate talent departures as a form of market correction, where dissatisfaction leads to competition and innovation.\n   - The broader message is an appreciation for simple regulatory changes that catalyze significant economic and market transformations.\n\n---\n\n### Areas That Can Be Challenged:\n\n1. **Causality of Departures**:\n   - The assertion that California\u2019s non-compete reforms are a major driver of OpenAI\u2019s brain drain may be overstated. Employees might leave due to factors like burnout, personal values, or better offers, independent of legal changes.\n\n2. **Idealization of Market Dynamics**:\n   - The portrayal of competition as universally beneficial may oversimplify the challenges of talent redistribution, such as knowledge silos or inefficiencies in onboarding new teams.\n\n3. **Critique of OpenAI**:\n   - While the criticism of OpenAI\u2019s shift toward profit maximization is valid, it doesn\u2019t account for potential benefits, such as accelerated development and global influence.\n\n4. **Neoliberal Lens**:\n   - The framing of the market as inherently optimal could be contested. Critics may argue that excessive market churn could harm long-term innovation by destabilizing core institutions.\n\n5. **Ethical Implications**:\n   - The discussion glosses over deeper ethical debates about partnerships with entities like Anduril and whether such collaborations fundamentally contradict the values of the tech community.\n\n6. **Broader Applicability**:\n   - The claim that competition always benefits everyone might not hold in industries where monopolistic tendencies or regulatory gaps exist, potentially stifling smaller players despite increased activity.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaway:\nThe piece argues that OpenAI\u2019s talent exodus and California\u2019s regulatory reforms demonstrate the power of market forces to drive competition, innovation, and systemic change. While insightful, its emphasis on market primacy, simplified causality, and lack of deeper ethical engagement invite critical examination. The \u201csmoke\u201d of talent departures indeed signals underlying issues, but the broader narrative of adaptive market benefits deserves nuanced scrutiny."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"f5270f87-80b8-4629-825e-941c1c8941cd","request_id":"8f54e6d62d87405a-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f5270f87-80b8-4629-825e-941c1c8941cd","children":[]}}}
