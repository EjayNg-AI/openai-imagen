On behalf of the government and the people of Malaysia, I sincerely welcome Your Majesty, ASEAN leaders, guests of the Chair, Secretary-General Guterres, the EU President, the President of Brazil, Lula, Ramaphosa of South Africa, and Mark Khani of Canada to join us here in Kuala Lumpur at the 47th ASEAN Summit.\r\n\r\nWhen Malaysia assumed the ASEAN chairmanship, we certainly recognized the magnitude of responsibility before us. Leadership is never a matter of routine; it is a matter of choice\u2014to define priorities, to renew ASEAN\u2019s sense of purpose, and to chart a course worthy of our people\u2019s hopes.\r\n\r\nGlobal Context and ASEAN\u2019s Conviction\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: 2025 is a year that asks and demands more of us. The world feels unsettled\u2014the old order no longer certain, the new one not yet defined. Across regions we see rising contestation and growing uncertainty. These crosswinds test not only our economies but our collective resolve to keep faith in cooperation, to believe that understanding and dialogue can still prevail in a divided age. And yet, amid these trials, ASEAN endures. Our strength lies not in conformity but in the conviction that respect and reason still bind us together. Later this morning, when Cambodia and Thailand sign their peace agreement here in Kuala Lumpur, the world will see what conviction can achieve. It reminds us that reconciliation is not a concession but an act of courage, and that peace, once chosen, can reshape the future of nations. Thank you, Prime Minister of Thailand and Prime Minister of Cambodia.\r\n\r\nASEAN Vision 2045 and Timor-Leste\u2019s Admission\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: The ASEAN Community Vision 2045, adopted here in May, speaks of who we aspire to be and challenges us to make these aspirations real. It calls on us to strengthen ASEAN\u2019s unity and centrality, to pursue growth that is both resilient and fair, and to safeguard the welfare of generations to come. Timor-Leste\u2019s historic admission into ASEAN today gives new meaning to that vision. Congratulations again to President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusm\u00e3o. Its place here completes the ASEAN family, reaffirming our shared destiny and deep sense of regional kinship within this community. Timor-Leste\u2019s development and its strategic autonomy will find firm and lasting support.\r\n\r\nASEAN Unity and the Myanmar Peace Process\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: Your Majesty, Excellencies, distinguished guests, as Chair this year, I ought first to recognize the support and solidarity of my colleagues\u2014the leaders of ASEAN. Through that, we are able to realign our priorities to keep the Association resilient, relevant, and responsive to the times. Together with fellow Member States, we have worked to foster the conditions for peace in Myanmar. We know this requires patience and persistence and an honest appreciation of the realities on the ground. Guided by the Five-Point Consensus, ASEAN has drawn on every available channel and partner to reduce violence and ease the humanitarian crisis. But lasting peace cannot be imposed; it must be Myanmar-owned and Myanmar-led. Only then will the reconciliation endure.\r\n\r\nEconomic Integration and Energy Transition\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: The relative peace and prosperity that ASEAN has enjoyed for nearly six decades are not self-sustaining. They must be renewed through cooperation and strengthened by shared purpose. That is why ASEAN is deepening economic linkages, widening trade, and enhancing competitiveness. The upgrade of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement, to be launched at this Summit, will create a more seamless regional market, unlocking scale, efficiency, and opportunity for our businesses and workers alike. We are also advancing the ASEAN Power Grid. The new APG Financing Facility will help bridge funding gaps and accelerate our transition towards cleaner, more secure energy. In parallel, we are moving forward on the ASEAN Blue Economy Framework and the regional electric vehicle ecosystem, building the foundations of sustainable industry and green growth.\r\n\r\nDigital Economy and AI Governance\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: With ASEAN\u2019s digital economy expected to double to two trillion dollars by 2030, we have agreed to fast-track the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement by 2026. And to ensure technology remains our servant, not our master, we will establish the ASEAN AI Safety Network, AI Safe, to embed ethics, safety, and sound governance in the use of artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nExternal Partnerships and Regional Architecture\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, rising protectionism and shifting supply chains remind us that resilience depends on adaptability. ASEAN must not stand still. We must have the courage to forge new partnerships and the foresight to deepen existing ones. In that spirit, we hosted the second ASEAN\u2013GCC and the ASEAN\u2013GCC\u2013China summits earlier this year. Tomorrow we convene the fifth RCEP Leaders\u2019 Summit, advancing the world\u2019s largest free trade area toward its full potential. We also welcome again Brazil and South Africa, guests of the Chair, to the 20th East Asia Summit\u2014an important step in widening ASEAN\u2019s engagement with the BRICS and the G20 and strengthening our bridge to the Global South. The future of ASEAN will not be written by circumstance; it will be written by choice\u2014by the choices we make today.\r\n\r\nClosing Declaration\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: On that note, Your Majesty, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is my singular honor, on behalf of the people of Malaysia, to declare open the 47th ASEAN Summit and related summits. Thank you.\r\n\r\nTransition to the ASEAN Prize Award Ceremony\r\nMaster of Ceremonies: Thank you, Dato\u2019 Seri. May we request that you kindly step forward to the center of the stage for the next part of our program. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now proceed to the ASEAN Prize Award ceremony. The ASEAN Prize is the region\u2019s premier award honoring outstanding individuals or organizations for their inspiring contributions to building a stronger ASEAN community, an award initiated by the ASEAN Member States."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95044ebd-7e83-4bfd-855d-b3f62147ac43","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"db9e22a1-e448-41c4-8227-1999e862d59e","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"99fa0ff5-bb30-4722-8e49-0f991c09cac5","children":["e432cc16-3548-4dfb-b0ca-f985e55c2608"]},"e432cc16-3548-4dfb-b0ca-f985e55c2608":{"id":"e432cc16-3548-4dfb-b0ca-f985e55c2608","message":{"id":"e432cc16-3548-4dfb-b0ca-f985e55c2608","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761623233.9196017,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"95044ebd-7e83-4bfd-855d-b3f62147ac43","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"6a047012-5df7-4f9d-a9ca-1a558c98e28a","turn_exchange_id":"db9e22a1-e448-41c4-8227-1999e862d59e","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6a047012-5df7-4f9d-a9ca-1a558c98e28a","children":["2b936e12-3060-4502-8455-2d0c226490fa"]},"2b936e12-3060-4502-8455-2d0c226490fa":{"id":"2b936e12-3060-4502-8455-2d0c226490fa","message":{"id":"2b936e12-3060-4502-8455-2d0c226490fa","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761623233.9305267,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"95044ebd-7e83-4bfd-855d-b3f62147ac43","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"e432cc16-3548-4dfb-b0ca-f985e55c2608","turn_exchange_id":"db9e22a1-e448-41c4-8227-1999e862d59e","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e432cc16-3548-4dfb-b0ca-f985e55c2608","children":["5424bc3f-6384-450f-9332-8dbcc390252f"]},"5424bc3f-6384-450f-9332-8dbcc390252f":{"id":"5424bc3f-6384-450f-9332-8dbcc390252f","message":{"id":"5424bc3f-6384-450f-9332-8dbcc390252f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761623233.9572341,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","request_id":"95044ebd-7e83-4bfd-855d-b3f62147ac43","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"2b936e12-3060-4502-8455-2d0c226490fa","turn_exchange_id":"db9e22a1-e448-41c4-8227-1999e862d59e","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2b936e12-3060-4502-8455-2d0c226490fa","children":["d5d71aba-299a-4d3b-963f-794548412676"]},"d5d71aba-299a-4d3b-963f-794548412676":{"id":"d5d71aba-299a-4d3b-963f-794548412676","message":{"id":"d5d71aba-299a-4d3b-963f-794548412676","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761623234.886437,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Thinking

dialogue and cooperation over coercion and confrontation amid ongoing global conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, North Korea, and heightened U.S.-China rivalry. The summit saw participation from ASEAN nations and partners including the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, and others. Key themes included regional peace, lawful resolutions in the South China Sea, and economic cooperation. Anwar and other leaders stressed the need for engagement, especially regarding North Korea and Myanmar, with calls for the implementation of ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point Consensus for Myanmar.\n\nThe summit also highlighted renewed U.S. trade efforts, with President Trump securing economic agreements in Southeast Asia and celebrating a ceasefire expansion in Cambodia-Thailand. Canada announced accelerated free trade talks with ASEAN, seeking economic resilience amid rising U.S. tariffs. ASEAN and key partners, including China, finalized discussions under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), aiming to enhance regional economic integration despite its relatively loose provisions.

Tan Sri Nazir Razak, chairman of the ASEAN Business Advisory Council, emphasized the need for the summit to yield substantive outcomes. Amid escalating trade disputes and a weakened US role under the \"America First\" approach, regional leaders stressed the importance of collaboration and outward engagement. Albanese highlighted Australia's economic integration and commitment to Southeast Asia, noting its role as ASEAN\u2019s first dialogue partner since 1974. He celebrated East Timor's accession as ASEAN's 11th member and reaffirmed ASEAN's role in ensuring regional stability. Indonesian business leader Anindya Bakrie warned of a \u201cheating up\u201d Indo-Pacific, likening current tensions to a new Cold War. However, hopes remain for a trade truce between the US and China, with recent negotiations seen as constructive. Albanese recently secured a critical minerals deal with the US, despite concerns from Beijing, although his recent meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang was reportedly positive.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1761552180.0,"attribution":"www.theaustralian.com.au"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-pm-modi-attend-asean-summit-virtually-ruling-out-trump-meeting-2025-10-23/","title":"India PM Modi to attend ASEAN summit virtually, ruling out Trump meeting","snippet":"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur virtually, ruling out a face-to-face meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and casting doubt on the immediate conclusion of a trade deal between India and the U.S. Ongoing trade negotiations have been complicated by India's Russian oil imports, prompting the U.S. to impose a 25% punitive tariff on Indian goods in August, raising total tariffs to 50%. Modi cited the Deepavali festival as the reason for his virtual participation. The ASEAN summit, scheduled from October 26 to 28, will host leaders from ASEAN's 10 member states, along with key partners like China, Japan, and the U.S. Malaysian officials had indicated a potential Trump visit on October 26, sparking speculation about a Modi-Trump meeting. Although Trump confirmed a recent conversation with Modi that focused on trade, no details were shared by Modi, and the U.S. has not officially confirmed Trump's trip. Recent reports suggest a possible trade deal could reduce tariffs on Indian imports to 15-16%, with remaining issues related to energy and agriculture.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1761195171.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/world-leaders-look-build-economic-trade-ties-after-trump-departs-asean-summit-2025-10-27/","title":"China fills US void at ASEAN Summit with push for trade multilateralism","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":1761541302.222,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"asean.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://asean.org/asean-economic-community-council-statement-on-the-substantial-conclusion-of-the-asean-defa-negotiations/","title":"ASEAN Economic Community Council Statement on the ...","snippet":"4 days ago \u2014 DEFA is expected to be the world's first most comprehensive regional agreement on the digital economy.

The speech\u2019s \u201cunity/centrality\u201d theme is credibly underpinned by that outcome. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news62\ue202turn0news64\ue202turn0search20\ue201  \n- **Concrete trade facilitation:** He highlighted an **upgrade to ATIGA**.

It is promising but fragile; durability will hinge on verification and domestic politics in both countries. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- **External architecture & minilateral breadth:** He situates ASEAN amid **RCEP** (5th Leaders\u2019 Summit convened in KL), BRICS/G20 outreach, and GCC ties\u2014this is accurate and projects \u201ccentrality through convening.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search14\ue201\n\n# Strengths of the speech\n\n1) **Coherent narrative arc:** \u201cOld order unsettled \u2192 ASEAN endurance \u2192 tangible wins (Timor-Leste, ATIGA, APG, DEFA/AI).\u201d It avoids laundry-list drift and stitches policy items to a single thesis: *agency over drift*.  \n2) **Deliverables over platitudes:** He names mechanisms (ATIGA upgrade, APG financing, DEFA timeline, AI Safe) rather than abstract aspirations, boosting credibility. (Sources above.)  \n3) **Balanced tone on Myanmar:** \u201cMyanmar-owned and Myanmar-led\u201d while citing the **Five-Point Consensus** keeps unity while acknowledging limits of external leverage. (Consistent with ASEAN lines this week.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1news19\ue201\n\n# Limitations and blind spots (where rigor falls short)\n\n- **Myanmar pathway still vague:** Reaffirming the Five-Point Consensus without enforcement or sequencing (e.g., ceasefire \u2192 humanitarian corridors \u2192 phased political talks) perpetuates process without leverage. Expect minimal near-term violence reduction absent clearer conditionality. (ASEAN readouts this week stayed general.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1news19\ue201  \n- **AI governance detail-thin:** \u201cAI Safe\u201d is signposted but lacks scope (foundation models vs high-risk sectors?), instruments (testing/assurance regimes? cross-border incident reporting?), and alignment to partner regimes (EU AI Act-style risk tiers; OECD/GPAI work). The risk is a branding exercise unless backed by standards, sandboxes, and procurement levers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue201  \n- **Energy transition realism:** APG financing is a real step, but **~US$800 b** grid & generation needs to 2045 imply hard choices on tariff reform, cross-border PPAs, and system-operability rules. The speech glides over these political-economy frictions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- **Peace accord durability:** Celebrating the Thai\u2013Cambodian deal is fair; however, border de-escalations historically unravel without robust verification and domestic buy-in. Early reporting suggests mechanisms, but success metrics and dispute-resolution protocols weren\u2019t mentioned from the dais. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- **Metrics for ATIGA/DEFA:** He doesn\u2019t specify non-tariff barrier reduction targets (e.g., time-to-clear customs, mutual recognition coverage) or DEFA\u2019s concrete cross-border data and e-payments interoperability milestones\u2014key to converting vision into GDP.\n\n# Strategic assessment (net impact)\n\n- **Credibility:** High. The address is unusually well-moored to things actually happening in KL this week (Timor-Leste accession; ATIGA protocol; APG financing; RCEP leaders\u2019 session; DEFA timeline). That linkage elevates ASEAN \u201ccentrality\u201d from slogan to convening power. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news62\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn1search10\ue201  \n- **Execution risk:** Material. Delivery now hinges on (i) APG project-prep and bankable pipelines; (ii) DEFA/AI-Safe turning into enforceable, interoperable rules; (iii) Myanmar diplomacy with teeth; and (iv) keeping peace-accord momentum beyond summit optics.  \n- **Geopolitical positioning:** The text walks a careful line\u2014open to BRICS/G20/Global South while keeping RCEP at the core and welcoming broad partners. That hedging is consistent with the week\u2019s dynamics. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201\n\n# Bottom line (scorecard)\n\n- **Rhetorical quality:** A\u2013 (clear thesis; good balance of values and deliverables)  \n- **Policy specificity:** B (strong on what; lighter on how/metrics)  \n- **Feasibility & follow-through risk:** B\u2013 (depends on regulatory detail, financing structures, and conflict-management institutions)  \n- **Overall impact on ASEAN credibility:** **Positive**\u2014this is one of the more grounded opening addresses in recent summits.\n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Key verified developments tied to the speech\ue202turn0news62,turn0news64,turn0search3,turn0search12,turn0search2,turn0search4,turn1search10\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news62\ue202turn0news64\ue202turn0search20\ue201","start_idx":472,"end_idx":516,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/fbc05e88d80a998a5ea542806437a76c?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://timor-leste.gov.tl/?lang=en&p=45802&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/east-timor-asias-youngest-nation-becomes-aseans-11th-member-2025-10-26/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/east-timor-asias-youngest-nation-becomes-aseans-11th-member-2025-10-26/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"East Timor, Asia's youngest nation, becomes ASEAN's 11th member","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/east-timor-asias-youngest-nation-becomes-aseans-11th-member-2025-10-26/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1761443880.0,"snippet":"On October 26, 2025, East Timor (Timor-Leste), Asia\u2019s youngest nation, officially joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as its 11th member.

Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao described the achievement as a \u201chistoric moment\u201d and a new beginning for the country's young democracy, which gained independence from Indonesia in 2002 after centuries of colonial and conflict-ridden history.\n\nRamos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, had initially proposed ASEAN membership in the 1970s.

East Timor, with a population of 1.4 million and a GDP of $2 billion, gains access to a $3.8 trillion ASEAN economy. ASEAN leaders emphasized the move as a symbol of inclusivity and regional unity, although challenges remain due to East Timor\u2019s limited administrative and institutional capacity.\n\nIn a parallel development, Cambodia and Thailand signed an expanded border ceasefire agreement, brokered in part by U.S. President Donald Trump. The agreement includes the release of prisoners and withdrawal of heavy weapons, with ASEAN members overseeing implementation. Leaders hailed the accord as a major step toward lasting peace. Additional meetings at the summit involved leaders from China, Canada, Japan, and other major partners, reinforcing ASEAN\u2019s strategic regional role.

Despite its modest $2 billion economy\u2014just a fraction of ASEAN's $3.8 trillion GDP\u2014East Timor sees this membership as a gateway to economic growth, trade, and investment opportunities.\n\nThe accession, which took 14 years to finalize, was marked by a formal ceremony at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, where the nation's flag was presented amidst applause. Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao described the achievement as a \u201chistoric moment\u201d and a new beginning for the country's young democracy, which gained independence from Indonesia in 2002 after centuries of colonial and conflict-ridden history.\n\nRamos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, had initially proposed ASEAN membership in the 1970s.

Twenty years ago, our predecessors had the wisdom and foresight to establish the East Asia Summit as a leaders\u2019 forum for dialogue on strategic, political, and economic issues of common interest and concern, a forum which strives to strengthen global norms and universally recognized values, with ASEAN as the driving force. Today, we must renew our shared purpose, reassert our objectives, and promote principled, forward-looking engagements. We will continue to advocate for dialogue over coercion, balance over binaries, cooperation over confrontation. We affirm our stand on global peace and security, for multilateralism and international law. Now I wish to address the following issues.\r\n\r\nGaza\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: First, Gaza. Of course, we welcome President Trump\u2019s comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict. It is an important, critical beginning to stop this madness, genocide, and atrocities. But we have urged that this must be continued, closely monitored, so that there is lasting peace\u2014an inclusive, just, and lasting political solution for Palestine.\r\n\r\nMyanmar\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: On Myanmar, this has been deliberated by my colleagues in ASEAN the whole day yesterday. We are still committed to honoring the Five-Point Consensus. At the same time, I must acknowledge, in the two meetings I had, with the understanding of my colleagues in ASEAN, that the leaders, Prime Minister Mai, have been cooperative, engaging with us in the aftermath of the earthquake, when I met him in Bangkok. I said ASEAN is committed to give all the necessary humanitarian support on two conditions: number one, immediate ceasefire\u2014stop the bombings; and second, that the humanitarian assistance, including our military field hospital in Myanmar, is given full access to all, irrespective of minorities or political persuasions. I must commend that the senior general agreed with this, and for the last one year you see some relative progress, although there have been complaints about some shootings, but certainly not on the scale that we used to see. I met him again in Beijing, calling for the ceasefire and mentioning the ASEAN consensus on the need for inclusive, fair, and free elections. Of course, we do not necessarily share all his views, but I would still urge colleagues to continue the engagement, continue the humanitarian assistance, and allow them to conduct the affairs of the state of Myanmar through their own national mechanisms, to engage with all parties. All the opposition groups\u201427 of them\u2014have been invited to Malaysia, to Kuala Lumpur, so that we are engaging with all sides, and the 27 groups, minorities and parties, did so in a very positive manner, coordinated by our foreign ministry.\r\n\r\nSouth China Sea\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: On the South China Sea, of course, there have been extensive discussions. We are happy that all parties have agreed to formulate this Code of Conduct. But, as is the case with all issues, we want it to be resolved within ASEAN, and ASEAN with our partners in the region, because the moment it is seen to be imposed and dictated by outside forces, things become more problematic and tense. As far as we\u2019re concerned, things are still under control. We still strongly urge all parties to engage in these negotiations under universally recognized principles of international law\u2014precisely the 1982 UNCLOS\u2014and the Code of Conduct.\r\n\r\nDPRK\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: On the DPRK, of course we are concerned with the recent surge in ballistic missile launches. But Malaysia\u2019s position is to continue with some form of engagement, because once we call for engagement in all areas, from Gaza to Ukraine to Myanmar, we should not preclude engagement with the DPRK.\r\n\r\nDeclarations to Be Adopted\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: Your Majesty, excellencies, at this summit today we will adopt the Declaration on the 20th anniversary of the East Asia Summit and the Leaders\u2019 Statement on promoting localization in anticipatory action for disaster preparedness and response. I congratulate the EAS participating countries for the commitment and the tenacity that led to this achievement. This is a clear example that diversity does not divide.\r\n\r\nGuests of the Chair: Brazil and South Africa\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: In this meeting, I have to personally make a remark to two of our colleagues as guests of the chair: the presidents of Brazil and South Africa. President Lula is on his way, yet to arrive. And President Ramaphosa of South Africa represents the new pace, new conscience of democratic transition, and strongly supports multilateralism, and we want Africa to be very much part of this engagement of expanding our trading links, investments, and geopolitical arrangements. Similarly with Lula da Silva of Brazil\u2014an outstanding country in Latin America\u2014I wish to continue to engage with countries in ASEAN in extending our multilateral arrangements in trade and investments, and, I believe, within the whole of Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nClosing and Media Break\r\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim: So thank you very much again to all\u2014Your Majesty and leaders present\u2014and I will now invite our friends and guests from the media to enjoy what is left of the coffee and tea and cakes, and come back when we have a statement to make. Thank you very much."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"4ce7aaab-8288-4e45-892e-5d15817d65d9","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"472bea3f-0f96-447a-8a89-15299dc48949","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d88461d5-ebd9-4096-b710-7289c2770b2d","children":["ac81b58f-d423-4b6c-9f3e-4402a9321740"]},"ac81b58f-d423-4b6c-9f3e-4402a9321740":{"id":"ac81b58f-d423-4b6c-9f3e-4402a9321740","message":{"id":"ac81b58f-d423-4b6c-9f3e-4402a9321740","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761624061.8330998,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"4ce7aaab-8288-4e45-892e-5d15817d65d9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"ace99306-2a91-448c-82d3-a4d5289a028e","turn_exchange_id":"472bea3f-0f96-447a-8a89-15299dc48949","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ace99306-2a91-448c-82d3-a4d5289a028e","children":["49075c3a-d07b-4a71-8559-184427b19c14"]},"49075c3a-d07b-4a71-8559-184427b19c14":{"id":"49075c3a-d07b-4a71-8559-184427b19c14","message":{"id":"49075c3a-d07b-4a71-8559-184427b19c14","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761624061.8451293,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"4ce7aaab-8288-4e45-892e-5d15817d65d9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"ac81b58f-d423-4b6c-9f3e-4402a9321740","turn_exchange_id":"472bea3f-0f96-447a-8a89-15299dc48949","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ac81b58f-d423-4b6c-9f3e-4402a9321740","children":["ecc503e2-6608-4fc3-bcf6-98d870c13618"]},"ecc503e2-6608-4fc3-bcf6-98d870c13618":{"id":"ecc503e2-6608-4fc3-bcf6-98d870c13618","message":{"id":"ecc503e2-6608-4fc3-bcf6-98d870c13618","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761624061.917253,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating Day 2 remarks","content":"I need to check current events like the Trump plan for Gaza, ASEAN summit details, EAS anniversary, and possible leaders attending.

dialogue and cooperation over coercion and confrontation amid ongoing global conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, North Korea, and heightened U.S.-China rivalry. The summit saw participation from ASEAN nations and partners including the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, and others. Key themes included regional peace, lawful resolutions in the South China Sea, and economic cooperation. Anwar and other leaders stressed the need for engagement, especially regarding North Korea and Myanmar, with calls for the implementation of ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point Consensus for Myanmar.\n\nThe summit also highlighted renewed U.S. trade efforts, with President Trump securing economic agreements in Southeast Asia and celebrating a ceasefire expansion in Cambodia-Thailand. Canada announced accelerated free trade talks with ASEAN, seeking economic resilience amid rising U.S. tariffs. ASEAN and key partners, including China, finalized discussions under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), aiming to enhance regional economic integration despite its relatively loose provisions. Celebrations included a birthday for Brazil's President Lula, symbolizing lighter moments amid serious diplomacy.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1761558874.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-anwar-asean-east-asia-summit-6a54cf7612380b59b3bc1be12cb7ee71","title":"Malaysian PM calls for cooperation at East Asia summit","snippet":"10 hours ago \u2014 On other issues, Anwar commended Trump's plan to end the Gaza conflict, but said more must be done to ensure a just and lasting political ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1761558875.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bernama.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=2483247","title":"ASEAN Must Forge New Ties, Deepen Existing Ones Amid ...","snippet":"2 days ago \u2014 Upholding the theme \u201cInclusivity and Sustainability\u201d in ASEAN, Anwar also announced the upgrade of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement, to be ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1761472680.0,"attribution":"www.bernama.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"asean.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://asean.org/20th-east-asia-summit-reviews-cooperation-and-future-direction-at-its-20th-anniversary/","title":"20th East Asia Summit Reviews Cooperation and Future ...","snippet":"17 hours ago \u2014 The Leaders also adopted the Kuala Lumpur Declaration on the Twentieth Anniversary of the EAS and thematic statements on relevant issues.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"asean.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://asean.org/secretary-general-of-asean-delivers-special-address-at-the-opening-ceremony-of-the-asean-ai-malaysia-summit-2025/","title":"Secretary-General of ASEAN delivers special address at ...","snippet":"Aug 12, 2025 \u2014 Secretary-General of ASEAN delivers special address at the opening ceremony of the ASEAN AI Malaysia Summit 2025.

This move is aimed at facilitating humanitarian aid and earthquake relief following a devastating earthquake in Myanmar last month that killed thousands and caused severe damage. As the current chair of ASEAN, Anwar emphasized that the meeting is based on humanitarian grounds, given the lack of formal engagement between Myanmar and the regional bloc. Myanmar has been mired in conflict since a 2021 military coup, resulting in ongoing civil war. Though ceasefires have been declared by both sides to support relief efforts, violations have been reported. ASEAN has pressed Myanmar to implement its five-point peace plan and has excluded junta leaders from official meetings due to noncompliance. In addition to advocating for peace, Malaysia will continue its aid efforts through a Malaysian Armed Forces-run field hospital. The upcoming meeting marks a rare international appearance for Min Aung Hlaing, who has largely been isolated since the coup.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1744613102.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/egypt-proposes-53bn-gaza-rebuild-as-alternative-to-trump-plan","title":"Arab leaders endorse $53bn plan to rebuild Gaza as alternative to Trump idea","snippet":"Arab leaders have endorsed a $53 billion plan to rebuild Gaza under Palestinian Authority (PA) administration, as a counter to Donald Trump's controversial relocation proposal, which has been criticized for effectively enabling ethnic cleansing.

However, the plan has not secured Israel's support, a critical factor for its success, as Israel continues to maintain control over Gaza's territory. Furthermore, Hamas remains a significant political force in Gaza, rejecting any proposals that exclude its involvement.

Anwar calls for dialogue over coercion at East Asia summit","snippet":"At the 2025 East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim emphasized the importance of choosing dialogue and cooperation over coercion and confrontation amid ongoing global conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, North Korea, and heightened U.S.-China rivalry. The summit saw participation from ASEAN nations and partners including the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, and others. Key themes included regional peace, lawful resolutions in the South China Sea, and economic cooperation. Anwar and other leaders stressed the need for engagement, especially regarding North Korea and Myanmar, with calls for the implementation of ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point Consensus for Myanmar.\n\nThe summit also highlighted renewed U.S. trade efforts, with President Trump securing economic agreements in Southeast Asia and celebrating a ceasefire expansion in Cambodia-Thailand.

The earthquake resulted in over 3,700 deaths, widespread destruction of communities, and severe infrastructure damage in the already conflict-ridden country. The ceasefire extension, initially declared on April 2 for 20 days, was announced through state media, citing junta chief Min Aung Hlaing's \"sympathy and understanding\" for affected citizens. This development follows high-level talks led by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, chair of ASEAN, with both the junta and a key resistance group to encourage a humanitarian pause in hostilities. Despite the ceasefire, reports from the United Nations and other organizations indicate that military operations, including airstrikes, have continued in certain areas. The country has been in turmoil since the 2021 military coup that ousted a democratically elected government, leading to ongoing civil conflict.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1745327061.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysian-pm-says-meet-myanmar-junta-head-bangkok-2025-04-14/","title":"Malaysian PM says to meet Myanmar junta head in Bangkok","snippet":"Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced plans to meet Myanmar's junta leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, in Bangkok on April 17, 2025, to advocate for an extension of a ceasefire between the military government and rebel groups. This move is aimed at facilitating humanitarian aid and earthquake relief following a devastating earthquake in Myanmar last month that killed thousands and caused severe damage. As the current chair of ASEAN, Anwar emphasized that the meeting is based on humanitarian grounds, given the lack of formal engagement between Myanmar and the regional bloc. Myanmar has been mired in conflict since a 2021 military coup, resulting in ongoing civil war. Though ceasefires have been declared by both sides to support relief efforts, violations have been reported. ASEAN has pressed Myanmar to implement its five-point peace plan and has excluded junta leaders from official meetings due to noncompliance. In addition to advocating for peace, Malaysia will continue its aid efforts through a Malaysian Armed Forces-run field hospital. The upcoming meeting marks a rare international appearance for Min Aung Hlaing, who has largely been isolated since the coup.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1744613102.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"s3-csis-web.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://s3-csis-web.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/doc/delivering_humanitarian_assistance_to_myanmar.pdf?download=1","title":"Delivering Humanitarian Assistance to Myanmar","snippet":"The ASEAN Agreement on Disaster.

The speech affirms principles but omits **timelines, red lines, or crisis-communications protocols**.\n- **DPRK engagement:** Consistent, but light on **practical levers** (humanitarian carve-outs, Track-2 channels, maritime deconfliction) that ASEAN/EAS could sponsor.\n\n# Craft and signalling\n\n- **Tone & balance:** Statesmanlike, measured, and more concrete than many EAS openers (naming adopted texts, specific Myanmar conditions).

Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced plans to meet Myanmar's junta leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, in Bangkok on April 17, 2025, to advocate for an extension of a ceasefire between the military government and rebel groups. This move is aimed at facilitating humanitarian aid and earthquake relief following a devastating earthquake in Myanmar last month that killed thousands and caused severe damage. As the current chair of ASEAN, Anwar emphasized that the meeting is based on humanitarian grounds, given the lack of formal engagement between Myanmar and the regional bloc. Myanmar has been mired in conflict since a 2021 military coup, resulting in ongoing civil war. Though ceasefires have been declared by both sides to support relief efforts, violations have been reported. ASEAN has pressed Myanmar to implement its five-point peace plan and has excluded junta leaders from official meetings due to noncompliance. In addition to advocating for peace, Malaysia will continue its aid efforts through a Malaysian Armed Forces-run field hospital. The upcoming meeting marks a rare international appearance for Min Aung Hlaing, who has largely been isolated since the coup.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Myanmar junta extends ceasefire to support earthquake relief, state media says","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-junta-extends-temporary-ceasefire-april-30-support-earthquake-relief-2025-04-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Myanmar's military junta has extended a temporary ceasefire until April 30, 2025, to facilitate relief and reconstruction efforts after a devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck near Mandalay late last month.

The ceasefire extension, initially declared on April 2 for 20 days, was announced through state media, citing junta chief Min Aung Hlaing's \"sympathy and understanding\" for affected citizens. This development follows high-level talks led by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, chair of ASEAN, with both the junta and a key resistance group to encourage a humanitarian pause in hostilities.

Anwar and other leaders stressed the need for engagement, especially regarding North Korea and Myanmar, with calls for the implementation of ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point Consensus for Myanmar.\n\nThe summit also highlighted renewed U.S. trade efforts, with President Trump securing economic agreements in Southeast Asia and celebrating a ceasefire expansion in Cambodia-Thailand. Canada announced accelerated free trade talks with ASEAN, seeking economic resilience amid rising U.S. tariffs. ASEAN and key partners, including China, finalized discussions under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), aiming to enhance regional economic integration despite its relatively loose provisions. Celebrations included a birthday for Brazil's President Lula, symbolizing lighter moments amid serious diplomacy.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AP News"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201","start_idx":4791,"end_idx":4810,"safe_urls":["https://s3-csis-web.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/doc/delivering_humanitarian_assistance_to_myanmar.pdf?download=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([s3-csis-web.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com](https://s3-csis-web.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/doc/delivering_humanitarian_assistance_to_myanmar.pdf?download=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Delivering Humanitarian Assistance to Myanmar","url":"https://s3-csis-web.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/doc/delivering_humanitarian_assistance_to_myanmar.pdf?download=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1639754631.0,"snippet":"The ASEAN Agreement on Disaster.

The Arab League summit in Cairo presented this initiative, focusing on emergency relief, infrastructure rebuilding, and long-term economic development, including commercial facilities, a technology hub, and an airport. However, the plan has not secured Israel's support, a critical factor for its success, as Israel continues to maintain control over Gaza's territory. Furthermore, Hamas remains a significant political force in Gaza, rejecting any proposals that exclude its involvement. Despite backing from the UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who supports the initiative and calls for resuming ceasefire negotiations in Gaza, the plan faces numerous challenges including political divisions and regional tensions.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The
