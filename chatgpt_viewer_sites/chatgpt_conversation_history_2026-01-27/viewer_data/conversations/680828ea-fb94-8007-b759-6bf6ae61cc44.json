The U.S. imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China retaliated with 125% tariffs on American goods, contributing to instability in financial markets, rising interest rates, and concerns about inflation and economic growth. Despite this, President Trump downplayed the situation, stating the U.S. is \"doing fine with China\" and promised more amicable relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump suggested that the final tariff rates would be significantly reduced. While the administration has engaged in trade talks with various countries, there is no move yet to rescind the baseline 10% tariffs. China has warned other nations against trade agreements that could harm its interests. Amid this backdrop, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, even expressing frustration with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though he later clarified he would not remove him.

The U.S. imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China retaliated with 125% tariffs on American goods, contributing to instability in financial markets, rising interest rates, and concerns about inflation and economic growth. Despite this, President Trump downplayed the situation, stating the U.S. is \"doing fine with China\" and promised more amicable relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump suggested that the final tariff rates would be significantly reduced. While the administration has engaged in trade talks with various countries, there is no move yet to rescind the baseline 10% tariffs. China has warned other nations against trade agreements that could harm its interests. Amid this backdrop, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, even expressing frustration with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though he later clarified he would not remove him. The trade tensions and economic uncertainty have significantly impacted financial markets, although Bessent\u2019s remarks led to a temporary 2.5% rise in the S&P 500.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745344295.0,"attribution":"AP News"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.aljazeera.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/why-china-has-warned-countries-against-appeasing-trump-in-trade-deals","title":"Why China has warned countries against 'appeasing' Trump in trade ...","snippet":"The Trump administration has said it is in negotiations with more than 70 countries.

Effective from April 15, the directive responds to increasing concerns about trade fraud amid rising tensions over U.S. tariffs. The document emphasizes stricter inspections of imported goods, especially raw materials used for exports, to verify their origin. Vietnam faces a potential 46% tariff imposed by the U.S., currently paused until July, which threatens its export-reliant economy and foreign investments. Although the directive does not name any origin country for fraudulent shipments, the U.S. has accused China of rerouting goods through Vietnam to bypass tariffs. The directive follows an emergency government meeting after President Trump announced the duties and coincides with China's President Xi Jinping's visit to Vietnam, during which cooperation agreements, including on product origin certification, were signed. The Vietnamese government has instructed officials to enhance monitoring of \"Made in Vietnam\" labels and investigate enterprises with sudden increases in origin certificate applications, with the goal of proposing specific anti-fraud measures when necessary.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745301900.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-excludes-smartphones-computers-reciprocal-tariffs-2025-04-12/","title":"Trump spares smartphones, computers, other electronics from China ...","snippet":"For the Chinese imports, the exclusion of the tech products applies only to Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which climbed to 125% this week, ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744502400.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-starts-collecting-trumps-new-10-tariff-smashing-global-trade-norms-2025-04-05/","title":"US starts collecting Trump's 10% tariff, smashing global trade norms","snippet":"European Union imports will face a 20% tariff, while Chinese goods will be hit with a 34% tariff, bringing Trump's total new levies on China to ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743811200.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/22/us-huge-tariffs-south-east-asian-solar-panels-energy-summit","title":"US to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on south-east Asia solar panels","snippet":"The United States announced plans to impose tariffs as high as 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, following a year-long investigation into allegations that Chinese firms were circumventing trade rules by exporting subsidized panels through these countries. The steepest tariff applies to Cambodian products due to non-cooperation in the probe, with Malaysia\u2019s Jinko Solar and Thailand\u2019s Trina Solar facing tariffs of 41% and 375%, respectively. The move stems from complaints made by solar manufacturers including Hanwha Qcells and First Solar. However, the Solar Energy Industries Association warns the tariffs could inadvertently hurt U.S. solar production by increasing costs on necessary imports. A final decision by the U.S. International Trade Commission is expected in June.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Energy Agency's chief Fatih Birol expressed concerns about global energy security ahead of a summit in London that includes major global powers but excludes Russia and China.

The suspension was enacted after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on global imports, sparking market turmoil. Israel, whose largest trading partner is the U.S. with $34 billion in bilateral trade in 2024, faces a potential 17% tariff on its goods unless an agreement is reached. Barkat, speaking from Abu Dhabi, noted that many of Israel's exports, such as high-tech and software services, would avoid the brunt of the tariffs. Although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's earlier attempt to gain a reprieve failed, discussions continue, including Trump-Netanyahu phone talks addressing both trade and indirect U.S.-Iran nuclear discussions. Barkat emphasized efforts to resolve the trade deficit and achieve \"a good understanding\" within the limited timeframe.

These tariffs, the highest in a century, have introduced economic strain domestically and globally. U.S. GDP is expected to fall to 1.8% from 2.8% in 2024, while China\u2019s growth forecast has been dropped to 4.0% due to retaliatory tariffs and escalating trade frictions, effectively creating a trade embargo between the two largest economies. Amid increasing economic concerns, over 30 countries have entered into tariff negotiations with the U.S. during IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. While negotiations with China have stalled, Trump remains optimistic about a potential deal. Meanwhile, early talks with Japan and India show preliminary progress but lack concrete outcomes. Several U.S. companies, including Kimberly-Clark and GE Aerospace, report significant cost burdens due to tariffs.

Culp emphasized that the zero-duty system has historically benefited the U.S. aerospace sector, contributing to a $75 billion annual trade surplus. However, the current trade war has introduced significant uncertainty, disrupting the aerospace industry's long-standing duty-free status and complicating aircraft deliveries. While GE Aerospace has not yet experienced shipment disruptions from key supplier Howmet Aerospace, tariffs pose a risk to the supply chain, particularly for the Leap 1A engine, a joint venture with France's Safran SA. Tariff-related costs are projected to exceed $500 million for GE Aerospace in 2025. The company is attempting to offset these costs through trade programs, cost controls, and a tariff surcharge. Additionally, travel demand has softened amid economic uncertainty, raising concerns that airlines may defer engine orders, though Culp remains optimistic that other carriers would fill any potential gaps in demand.

The U.S. imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China retaliated with 125% tariffs on American goods, contributing to instability in financial markets, rising interest rates, and concerns about inflation and economic growth. Despite this, President Trump downplayed the situation, stating the U.S. is \"doing fine with China\" and promised more amicable relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump suggested that the final tariff rates would be significantly reduced. While the administration has engaged in trade talks with various countries, there is no move yet to rescind the baseline 10% tariffs. China has warned other nations against trade agreements that could harm its interests. Amid this backdrop, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, even expressing frustration with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though he later clarified he would not remove him.

He characterized the current trade relationship as a mutual embargo, which both parties view as unsustainable. Bessent clarified that the Trump administration does not aim for economic decoupling but seeks a rebalancing\u2014China towards greater domestic consumption and the U.S. towards more manufacturing. He noted that existing high tariffs (145% on Chinese goods and 125% on U.S. goods) are likely to be reduced in the near future, potentially easing market pressure. His remarks contributed to a Wall Street rally, following a recent market drop caused by President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Additionally, Bessent indicated possible U.S. financial support for Argentina if external shocks threaten its economic recovery, conditional on the continuation of reform efforts by President Javier Milei\u2019s government.

Officials acknowledge that finalizing comprehensive agreements could take months due to the complexities involved. President Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 50% on numerous countries and the EU, which sparked global market instability. In response, the administration delayed the tariff hikes for 90 days to facilitate negotiations, though uncertainty persists.\n\nVice President JD Vance indicated progress in talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and meetings with Japanese officials are ongoing. Still, both countries, particularly Japan, have signaled reluctance to rush agreements. These frameworks may be strategically designed to underscore the U.S. as their key trading partner rather than China, which has opposed such moves. Markets remain volatile, with business leaders and investors eager for signs of resolution, though trade experts caution that rushed, vague agreements may yield limited long-term benefits.

These arrangements, however, are expected to be general frameworks or \"memorandums of understanding\" rather than detailed, binding trade deals. Officials acknowledge that finalizing comprehensive agreements could take months due to the complexities involved. President Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 50% on numerous countries and the EU, which sparked global market instability. In response, the administration delayed the tariff hikes for 90 days to facilitate negotiations, though uncertainty persists.\n\nVice President JD Vance indicated progress in talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and meetings with Japanese officials are ongoing. Still, both countries, particularly Japan, have signaled reluctance to rush agreements. These frameworks may be strategically designed to underscore the U.S. as their key trading partner rather than China, which has opposed such moves. Markets remain volatile, with business leaders and investors eager for signs of resolution, though trade experts caution that rushed, vague agreements may yield limited long-term benefits. The White House faces mounting pressure to present tangible trade progress to stabilize economic conditions and investor confidence.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745341355.063,"attribution":"Politico"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/16/trump-china-trade-strategy-00291979","title":"Trump wants to make a deal with China.

He characterized the current trade relationship as a mutual embargo, which both parties view as unsustainable. Bessent clarified that the Trump administration does not aim for economic decoupling but seeks a rebalancing\u2014China towards greater domestic consumption and the U.S. towards more manufacturing. He noted that existing high tariffs (145% on Chinese goods and 125% on U.S. goods) are likely to be reduced in the near future, potentially easing market pressure. His remarks contributed to a Wall Street rally, following a recent market drop caused by President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Additionally, Bessent indicated possible U.S. financial support for Argentina if external shocks threaten its economic recovery, conditional on the continuation of reform efforts by President Javier Milei\u2019s government. This follows his recent visit to Buenos Aires to reinforce U.S. backing for Argentina's $20 billion IMF loan program.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn11search0\ue202turn13search1\ue202turn9view0\ue201","start_idx":1583,"end_idx":1639,"safe_urls":["https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/why-china-has-warned-countries-against-appeasing-trump-in-trade-deals","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/us-looks-to-box-in-china-by-recruiting-other-trading-partners?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/16/trump-china-trade-strategy-00291979?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/china/vietnam-clamps-down-fraud-us-exports-document-shows-2025-04-22/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/why-china-has-warned-countries-against-appeasing-trump-in-trade-deals), [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/16/trump-china-trade-strategy-00291979?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/us-looks-to-box-in-china-by-recruiting-other-trading-partners?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/vietnam-clamps-down-fraud-us-exports-document-shows-2025-04-22/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Why China has warned countries against \u2018appeasing\u2019 Trump in trade deals | Trade War News | Al Jazeera","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/why-china-has-warned-countries-against-appeasing-trump-in-trade-deals","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Al Jazeera"},{"title":"Trump wants to make a deal with China.

Israel, whose largest trading partner is the U.S. with $34 billion in bilateral trade in 2024, faces a potential 17% tariff on its goods unless an agreement is reached. Barkat, speaking from Abu Dhabi, noted that many of Israel's exports, such as high-tech and software services, would avoid the brunt of the tariffs. Although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's earlier attempt to gain a reprieve failed, discussions continue, including Trump-Netanyahu phone talks addressing both trade and indirect U.S.-Iran nuclear discussions.

These tariffs, the highest in a century, have introduced economic strain domestically and globally. U.S. GDP is expected to fall to 1.8% from 2.8% in 2024, while China\u2019s growth forecast has been dropped to 4.0% due to retaliatory tariffs and escalating trade frictions, effectively creating a trade embargo between the two largest economies. Amid increasing economic concerns, over 30 countries have entered into tariff negotiations with the U.S. during IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. While negotiations with China have stalled, Trump remains optimistic about a potential deal. Meanwhile, early talks with Japan and India show preliminary progress but lack concrete outcomes. Several U.S. companies, including Kimberly-Clark and GE Aerospace, report significant cost burdens due to tariffs. Nevertheless, investor sentiment improved following Trump\u2019s comments on possible tariff reductions with China, boosting U.S. stock markets.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":5711,"end_idx":5711,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Trump optimistic after call about tariffs with South Korea | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-trade-minister-says-considering-measures-boost-us-imports-2025-04-08/","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Why China has warned countries against \u2018appeasing\u2019 Trump in trade deals | Trade War News | Al Jazeera","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/why-china-has-warned-countries-against-appeasing-trump-in-trade-deals","attribution":"Al Jazeera"},{"title":"Trump wants to make a deal with China.

Effective from April 15, the directive responds to increasing concerns about trade fraud amid rising tensions over U.S. tariffs. The document emphasizes stricter inspections of imported goods, especially raw materials used for exports, to verify their origin. Vietnam faces a potential 46% tariff imposed by the U.S., currently paused until July, which threatens its export-reliant economy and foreign investments. Although the directive does not name any origin country for fraudulent shipments, the U.S. has accused China of rerouting goods through Vietnam to bypass tariffs. The directive follows an emergency government meeting after President Trump announced the duties and coincides with China's President Xi Jinping's visit to Vietnam, during which cooperation agreements, including on product origin certification, were signed. The Vietnamese government has instructed officials to enhance monitoring of \"Made in Vietnam\" labels and investigate enterprises with sudden increases in origin certificate applications, with the goal of proposing specific anti-fraud measures when necessary.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745301900.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-chipmakers-outsourcing-manufacturing-will-escape-chinas-tariffs-2025-04-11/","title":"US chipmakers outsourcing manufacturing will escape China's tariffs","snippet":"U.S. chipmakers which outsource manufacturing will be exempt from China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, according to a notice by the ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744329600.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-imposes-12-temporary-tariff-some-steel-imports-2025-04-21/","title":"India imposes temporary tariff on some steel to stem cheap imports ...","snippet":"New Delhi's tariffs are primarily aimed at China, which was the second-biggest exporter of steel to India behind South Korea in 2024/25.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745291539.260996,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/trumps-latest-tariffs-loom-set-deepen-global-trade-war-2025-04-09/","title":"In stunning U-turn, Trump walks back some tariffs, triggering historic ...","snippet":"Trump said he would raise the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% from the 104% level that took effect at midnight, further escalating a high- ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744156800.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/which-asian-countries-have-chance-offset-trumps-tariffs-raychaudhuri-2025-04-16/","title":"Which Asian countries have a chance to offset Trump's tariffs?","snippet":"Going by this benchmark, Indonesia, the Philippines and China appear to have the most room to cut, with real rates of 4.75%, 3.95% and 3.35%, ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744762339.282783,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-tariffs-philippines-could-affect-weapons-deal-ambassador-says-2025-04-10/","title":"US tariffs on Philippines could affect weapons deal, ambassador says","snippet":"Imposing tariffs on U.S. imports from the Philippines could affect the U.S. ally's ability to afford U.S. weapons systems and a ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744243200.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/indias-small-steel-mills-pause-job-cuts-after-measures-curb-chinese-imports-2025-04-22/","title":"India's small steel mills pause job cuts after measures to curb ...","snippet":"Restricting import channels into India \"will place increasing pressure on Chinese officials to move faster in mandating domestic steel ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745331139.261988,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/how-china-went-courting-trump-never-yield-tariff-defiance-2025-04-13/","title":"How China went from courting Trump to 'never yield' tariff defiance","snippet":"Drawing on lessons from Trump's first term, China created a retaliatory playbook that includes tariffs as well as restrictions on about 60 U.S. ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744588800.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-q1-economic-growth-likely-slow-tariffs-darkens-outlook-2025-04-15/","title":"China Q1 GDP growth tops expectations, but US tariff shock looms ...","snippet":"For 2025, the economy is expected to grow at a subdued 4.5% pace year-on-year, the Reuters poll showed, slowing from last year's 5.0% pace ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744762339.282783,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-largest-trade-fair-exporters-say-us-markets-are-frozen-2025-04-15/","title":"At China's largest trade fair, exporters say US markets are 'frozen'","snippet":"Canton Fair is first China trade expo held since tariff spike \u00b7 Exporters say U.S. orders frozen, some say survival at stake \u00b7 Chinese firms race ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744675939.341336,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.koreatimes.co.kr","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/opinion/20250327/us-trade-policy-impact-on-south-korea-navigating-challenges-amid-global-realignment","title":"US trade policy impact on South Korea: Navigating challenges amid ...","snippet":"The U.S. cannot afford to alienate Korea while trying to reduce reliance on China.

According to a confidential source, a final deal remains uncertain. President Donald Trump recently claimed significant progress after meeting Japanese officials in what marked the first direct talks since implementing global import tariffs. Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa visited Washington to initiate discussions, likely covering non-tariff barriers and exchange rates. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato is also expected in Washington to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on currency topics. Trump has imposed tariffs, including a 24% duty on Japanese exports and a 25% levy on cars, although most are paused until July. A 10% universal tariff remains active.

The investment, part of Hyundai Motor Group's $21 billion U.S. package, was hastily revealed amid U.S. tariff uncertainties and political instability in South Korea following President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment. Investors questioned the feasibility and location of the proposed Louisiana plant and its ability to benefit South Korea in tariff negotiations, particularly since former President Trump recently imposed 25% tariffs on imported autos, including Korean products. The company's stock fell over 21% following the announcement. Amid weak domestic steel demand, labor strikes, and competition from Chinese imports, analysts warn the financially struggling Hyundai Steel may have to downscale the project. While Hyundai claims the project seeks to meet low-carbon steel demand in the U.S., experts argue better coordination with the government might have strengthened South Korea\u2019s negotiation position. Meanwhile, South Korean officials are preparing for critical trade discussions in Washington. The move has also upset Hyundai workers domestically, who are calling for investment in local operations amid factory suspensions and declining morale.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745364597.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/trade-wars-erupt-trump-hits-canada-mexico-china-with-steep-tariffs-2025-03-04/","title":"Trump triggers trade war, price hikes with tariffs on Canada, China ...","snippet":"Tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, Chinese goods come into force; China say it's ready for tariff war or 'any other type of war'; Trump says more ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1741132800.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/trumps-tariff-pause-brings-little-relief-recession-risk-lingers-2025-04-11/","title":"China retaliates again in Trump's trade war, prompting flight from US ...","snippet":"This week, Trump announced his reprieve for levies on dozens of countries while ratcheting up tariffs on Chinese imports effectively to 145%.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744329600.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asian-eu-steelmakers-shares-fall-after-trump-escalates-tariffs-2025-02-10/","title":"Trump raises tariffs on aluminum, steel imports in latest trade war salvo","snippet":"The tariffs will apply to millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and other countries that had ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1739232000.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/video/watch/idRW705616042025RP1?chan=us-news&location=channel-item","title":"Hong Kong post suspends goods mail to US over 'bullying' tariffs","snippet":"Hong Kong Post said on Wednesday it had suspended goods mail services by sea to the United States and will suspend its air mail postal ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744762339.282783,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-stokes-trade-war-world-reels-tariff-shock-2025-04-03/","title":"Trump tariffs sow fears of trade wars, recession and a $2300 iPhone","snippet":"Trump has slapped a 24% tariff on Japan and a 25% tariff on South Korea, both home to major U.S. military bases.

Hungary, an EU member with a car industry vital to its economy, is particularly vulnerable to the new U.S. tariffs, especially as it grapples with a slower-than-expected economic recovery and seeks to control inflation ahead of the 2026 elections. Orban mentioned ongoing negotiations with the U.S. about favorable economic arrangements but did not disclose specific details. Meanwhile, Trump and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed optimism about reaching a broader U.S.-EU trade agreement before a 90-day tariff negotiation deadline concludes. Under Trump\u2019s protectionist policy, the EU faces up to 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars, with additional duties broadly affecting other goods. Orban, a nationalist and long-time Trump ally, voiced his confidence in the Republican party maintaining influence in U.S. politics for the next 12 years, continuing what he describes as a patriotic Republican mindset.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744961617.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-excludes-smartphones-computers-reciprocal-tariffs-2025-04-12/","title":"Trump spares smartphones, computers, other electronics from China ...","snippet":"The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency published a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744502400.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/trump-plans-separate-levy-exempted-electronics-amid-trade-war-lutnick-says-2025-04-13/","title":"Tariffs on imported semiconductor chips coming soon, Trump says","snippet":"The new duties would fall outside Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs, under which levies on Chinese imports climbed to 125% last week, he said ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744502400.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china-criticises-trump-tariff-blackmail-market-turmoil-settles-2025-04-08/","title":"Stocks slide again as US forges ahead with 104% tariffs on China","snippet":"The European Commission, meanwhile, is mulling countertariffs of 25% on a range of U.S. goods including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744070400.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-tariffs-live-markets-whipsaw-trade-war-fuels-global-recession-fears-2025-04-11/","title":"Smartphones and electronics excluded from Trump's 125% tariffs list ...","snippet":"Late on Friday the Trump administration granted exclusions from the steep reciprocal tariffs on smartphones and a set of other electronics ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744329600.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-starts-collecting-trumps-new-10-tariff-smashing-global-trade-norms-2025-04-05/","title":"US starts collecting Trump's 10% tariff, smashing global trade norms","snippet":"European Union imports will face a 20% tariff, while Chinese goods will be hit with a 34% tariff, bringing Trump's total new levies on China ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743811200.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/trumps-latest-tariffs-loom-set-deepen-global-trade-war-2025-04-09/","title":"In stunning U-turn, Trump walks back some tariffs, triggering historic ...","snippet":"Trump said he would raise the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% from the 104% level that took effect at midnight, further escalating a high- ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744156800.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/china-rejects-us-blackmail-markets-steadier-2025-04-08/","title":"US duties on some China imports start - Reuters","snippet":"Wall Street rose, then fell Tuesday after the Trump administration signaled no delays or exemptions before its April 9 reciprocal tariff ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744070400.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68083062a608800789b646fbf69c7a3b","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"5c559db2-271c-4727-ab9a-94e2b398e3ba","request_id":"934925d44fa38932-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5c559db2-271c-4727-ab9a-94e2b398e3ba","children":["b8932ae7-d110-4463-8b80-0b76db184fb2"]},"b8932ae7-d110-4463-8b80-0b76db184fb2":{"id":"b8932ae7-d110-4463-8b80-0b76db184fb2","message":{"id":"b8932ae7-d110-4463-8b80-0b76db184fb2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1745367210.083319,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Collecting citations for Beijing reaction","content":"I need to gather reactions to Beijing's stance on trade from various sources.

threaten the rules-based international order. Although the U.S. was not named directly, the comments clearly targeted President Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of heavy tariffs on Chinese imports\u2014up to 145%\u2014which escalated trade tensions between the two countries. China has responded with its own counter-tariffs and is actively lobbying other nations, especially in the Global South and Southeast Asia, to resist U.S. tariff policies. President Xi Jinping recently called on Vietnam and Cambodia to join China in opposing these actions. China also plans to convene an informal United Nations Security Council meeting on April 23 to directly criticize the U.S. economic measures. Despite some nations like Japan appealing to the U.S. for relief, China insists that respect is a prerequisite for any negotiations. Meanwhile, Trump hinted at a possible easing of the tariffs, suggesting that excessive duties might deter consumer purchases, signaling a potential shift towards negotiation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744962796.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.scmp.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3306970/china-plans-host-un-event-denounce-us-tariffs-and-bullying","title":"China plans to host UN event to denounce US tariffs and 'bullying'","snippet":"The meeting, scheduled for next Wednesday, will see Beijing denounce the US for its aggressive use of tariffs with invitations extended to all ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744935139.287137,"attribution":"South China Morning Post"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-relations","title":"US-China relations: Latest News and Updates","snippet":"17 Apr 2025 - 10:10PM videocam. 10 \u00b7 US-China trade war \u00b7 China plans to host UN event to denounce US tariffs and 'bullying'.

These arrangements, however, are expected to be general frameworks or \"memorandums of understanding\" rather than detailed, binding trade deals. Officials acknowledge that finalizing comprehensive agreements could take months due to the complexities involved. President Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 50% on numerous countries and the EU, which sparked global market instability. In response, the administration delayed the tariff hikes for 90 days to facilitate negotiations, though uncertainty persists.\n\nVice President JD Vance indicated progress in talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and meetings with Japanese officials are ongoing. Still, both countries, particularly Japan, have signaled reluctance to rush agreements. These frameworks may be strategically designed to underscore the U.S. as their key trading partner rather than China, which has opposed such moves. Markets remain volatile, with business leaders and investors eager for signs of resolution, though trade experts caution that rushed, vague agreements may yield limited long-term benefits.

Although the Chamber previously considered challenging the emergency law Trump used to impose the tariffs\u2014a 1977 act allowing broad economic control during emergencies\u2014it chose not to sue due to the risk that tariffs could be re-imposed under a different statute. Multiple lawsuits have already been filed by other entities, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, who warned of significant economic harm to the state. Conservative legal groups like the Liberty Justice Center and the New Civil Liberties Alliance have also filed lawsuits, questioning the legality of using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for tariff purposes. Despite the legal uncertainty, the Chamber believes lobbying is the most effective means of providing immediate relief to small businesses affected by the tariffs. Legal experts suggest the lawsuits may be successful, but any resolution could take months unless preliminary injunctions are pursued. In response to growing concern among business owners, the Chamber continues to explore all options to influence policy and relieve tariff pressures.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744834572.715,"attribution":"Politico"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/14/global-covid-pandemic-response-bill-gates-partners-00053969","title":"How Bill Gates and his partners took over the global Covid ... - Politico","snippet":"Four health organizations, working closely together, spent almost $10 billion on responding to Covid across the world.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1663113600.0,"attribution":"Politico"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/02/24/russia-ukraine-war-oral-history-00083757","title":"'Something Was Badly Wrong': When Washington Realized Russia ...","snippet":"A first-ever oral history of how top U.S. and Western officials saw the warning signs of a European land war, their frantic attempts to stop it ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1677196800.0,"attribution":"Politico"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017f-478a-ddd1-adff-f78f74740000","title":"[PDF] China's Digital Ambitions: A Global Strategy to Supplant the Liberal ...","snippet":"As this report details in chapters 1 and 2, China develops digital infrastructure globally and to scale in order to establish the backbone of the industrial ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1646145159.0,"attribution":"Politico"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/29/how-will-the-history-books-remember-2021-526219","title":"How Will the History Books Remember 2021? - Politico","snippet":"We asked 18 top historians to imagine how this year will be written about a century from now.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1640736000.0,"attribution":"Politico"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/trumps-tariff-trade-waiting-china-00287407","title":"Diplomats see 'mess' in Trump's trade strategy","snippet":"The Trump administration's trade strategy, characterized by sudden tariff impositions and selective negotiations, has caused widespread confusion and concern among U.S. trading partners.

The administration paused some tariffs but maintained the baseline 10%, suggesting a reactive and unclear negotiation approach. Asian allies, considered key to countering Chinese trade practices, are prioritized, but even close partners like the EU and Israel have failed to secure early agreements. The administration insists on not only lowering tariffs but also removing non-tariff barriers such as livestock regulations and digital services taxes, complicating negotiations. Smaller and less influential countries find themselves sidelined, with many unsure how to proceed. The selective engagement, absence of clear communication, and unrealistic demands contribute to what diplomats describe as a \"mess,\" raising concerns over a fundamental shift in U.S. trade policy.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744409757.662,"attribution":"Politico"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68083062a608800789b646fbf69c7a3b","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"513f5e99-4ea7-46dd-879d-1be1bffa561b","request_id":"934925d44fa38932-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"513f5e99-4ea7-46dd-879d-1be1bffa561b","children":["2f187638-2ea8-42b4-9b8d-2b1c27eb4163"]},"2f187638-2ea8-42b4-9b8d-2b1c27eb4163":{"id":"2f187638-2ea8-42b4-9b8d-2b1c27eb4163","message":{"id":"2f187638-2ea8-42b4-9b8d-2b1c27eb4163","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1745367231.366969,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Final review of citations and countries","content":"Now that I've gathered five unique sources, the next step is ensuring we meet the 15 citation requirement. \n\nI\u2019ll focus on countries like Vietnam, Japan, India, the Philippines, Mexico, and South Korea.

While Mexico is still subject to a 25% tariff related to fentanyl and separate 25% duties on vehicles, auto parts (excluding U.S. content), and steel imports, many of its USMCA-compliant goods have been granted indefinite exemption from new global tariffs. In contrast to Canada\u2014which announced limited retaliatory tariffs\u2014Mexico avoided countermeasures and emphasized negotiation. Gutierrez emphasized ongoing collaboration aimed at mutual economic benefit, with U.S.-Mexico meetings scheduled next week to review tariffs on auto, steel, and aluminum imports, as well as the broader U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

The investment, part of Hyundai Motor Group's $21 billion U.S. package, was hastily revealed amid U.S. tariff uncertainties and political instability in South Korea following President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment. Investors questioned the feasibility and location of the proposed Louisiana plant and its ability to benefit South Korea in tariff negotiations, particularly since former President Trump recently imposed 25% tariffs on imported autos, including Korean products. The company's stock fell over 21% following the announcement. Amid weak domestic steel demand, labor strikes, and competition from Chinese imports, analysts warn the financially struggling Hyundai Steel may have to downscale the project. While Hyundai claims the project seeks to meet low-carbon steel demand in the U.S., experts argue better coordination with the government might have strengthened South Korea\u2019s negotiation position. Meanwhile, South Korean officials are preparing for critical trade discussions in Washington. The move has also upset Hyundai workers domestically, who are calling for investment in local operations amid factory suspensions and declining morale.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn17news4\ue201","start_idx":2478,"end_idx":2496,"safe_urls":["https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/22/white-house-is-close-on-japan-india-agreements-but-expect-them-to-be-light-on-specifics-00302762?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/22/white-house-is-close-on-japan-india-agreements-but-expect-them-to-be-light-on-specifics-00302762?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"White House is 'close' on Japan, India tariff agreements - but expect them to be light on specifics","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/22/white-house-is-close-on-japan-india-agreements-but-expect-them-to-be-light-on-specifics-00302762?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1745341355.063,"snippet":"The White House is nearing preliminary trade agreements with Japan and India aimed at avoiding steep U.S. tariffs announced earlier in April 2025.

Officials acknowledge that finalizing comprehensive agreements could take months due to the complexities involved. President Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 50% on numerous countries and the EU, which sparked global market instability. In response, the administration delayed the tariff hikes for 90 days to facilitate negotiations, though uncertainty persists.\n\nVice President JD Vance indicated progress in talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and meetings with Japanese officials are ongoing. Still, both countries, particularly Japan, have signaled reluctance to rush agreements. These frameworks may be strategically designed to underscore the U.S. as their key trading partner rather than China, which has opposed such moves. Markets remain volatile, with business leaders and investors eager for signs of resolution, though trade experts caution that rushed, vague agreements may yield limited long-term benefits.

The administration paused some tariffs but maintained the baseline 10%, suggesting a reactive and unclear negotiation approach. Asian allies, considered key to countering Chinese trade practices, are prioritized, but even close partners like the EU and Israel have failed to secure early agreements. The administration insists on not only lowering tariffs but also removing non-tariff barriers such as livestock regulations and digital services taxes, complicating negotiations.

Delivered via the Chinese embassy, the letter appealed for Japan's cooperation to combat rising protectionism. This request comes amidst escalating tensions in a trade war between China and the United States. On the previous day, China warned countries against entering broader economic agreements with the U.S. that could harm Chinese interests. Japan, a key U.S. ally, was recently affected by Trump\u2019s extensive tariff impositions and has initiated negotiations with the United States to resolve the issue. This appeal from China highlights the strained state of Sino-Japanese relations, which have been challenged in recent years by various issues, including territorial disputes and trade disagreements. Both countries' foreign ministries had not provided immediate comments on the matter.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn18view0\ue201","start_idx":3430,"end_idx":3448,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-pushes-anti-bullying-agenda-amid-tensions-with-us-2025-04-18/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-pushes-anti-bullying-agenda-amid-tensions-with-us-2025-04-18/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"China pushes anti-'bullying' agenda amid tensions with US | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-pushes-anti-bullying-agenda-amid-tensions-with-us-2025-04-18/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201","start_idx":3618,"end_idx":3636,"safe_urls":["https://www.globaltimes.cn/china/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Global Times](https://www.globaltimes.cn/china/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"CHINA","url":"https://www.globaltimes.cn/china/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Global Times"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn18view0\ue202turn16search0\ue201","start_idx":3776,"end_idx":3808,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-pushes-anti-bullying-agenda-amid-tensions-with-us-2025-04-18/","https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3306970/china-plans-host-un-event-denounce-us-tariffs-and-bullying?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-pushes-anti-bullying-agenda-amid-tensions-with-us-2025-04-18/), [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3306970/china-plans-host-un-event-denounce-us-tariffs-and-bullying?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"China pushes anti-'bullying' agenda amid tensions with US | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-pushes-anti-bullying-agenda-amid-tensions-with-us-2025-04-18/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"China plans to host UN event to denounce US tariffs and 'bullying'","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3306970/china-plans-host-un-event-denounce-us-tariffs-and-bullying?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1744935139.287137,"snippet":"The meeting, scheduled for next Wednesday, will see Beijing denounce the US for its aggressive use of tariffs with invitations extended to all ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":16,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"South China Morning Post"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":4984,"end_idx":4984,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Vietnam clamps down on fraud on US exports, document shows | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/vietnam-clamps-down-fraud-us-exports-document-shows-2025-04-22/","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"White House is 'close' on Japan, India tariff agreements -
