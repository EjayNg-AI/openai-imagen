This is my series to get everyone spun up and on the same page as to the current state of post-labor economics as of 2025. This episode will be about economic agency, or about what do humans actually need to participate in the economy.\r\n\r\n### Recap\r\n\r\nSo, before we dive in, let's do a recap of Lecture One, which was 'Better, Faster, Cheaper, Safer.' TL;DR: Once machines are better, faster, cheaper, and safer than humans, it becomes economically inevitable that labor substitution happens. And one of the primary things, once we established what labor substitution is and why it would happen, was that we examined the economy from the four primary pillars of economic participants. So, number one is consumers. That's you and me. Past economic paradigms would call it workers, but if workers are going away, then consumers become kind of the baseline. And consumers are the people who buy goods and services, or 'households' is how it's often referred to. So, consumers require economic agency through wages, property ownership, and democratic participation to meaningfully engage in society and markets. So, you basically want money in the bank. That's, at the end of the day, from an economic perspective, that's what you want and that's what you need. How it gets there, we can discuss that.\r\n\r\nSecond is businesses. Businesses face the paradox of wanting zero employees to lower costs while needing customers with sufficient purchasing power. This is where the fundamental paradox breaks down: if you fire everyone, if every company fires everyone and replaces them with AI and robots, then none of your consumers or none of your customers have any money left. So, therefore, the entire wage-labor social contract breaks down, and therefore aggregate demand drops, and you end up in a death spiral. And that's what we're really going to focus on in this episode.\r\n\r\nThe government's perspective wants to maintain tax revenue, demographic stability, and geopolitical position while providing minimal market intervention. That's what the government wants. However, if all of your citizens are unemployed, guess what? The citizens are going to rise up. We've seen this multiple times throughout history where if economic agency gets too low, the chances of things like civil war and revolution go up. And certainly, that's what we see; that's what has determined most of the outcomes of elections is 'kitchen table economics.' Basically, how well the economy is treating consumers really determines the voting temperature, if you want to say it that way, in America. So, the government doesn't necessarily care, you know, like the government cares about jobs and working insofar as that's how the country is run. If that breaks down, then the government is concerned.\r\n\r\nAnd then banks. Banks function as economic infrastructure connecting all stakeholders, requiring depositors with money for transaction and debt servicing. From the bank's perspective, the bank wants to be issuing debt in the form of mortgages and loans and collecting interest. At a fundamental level, that's how the banks work. If their customers are broke, then the bank is just going to be foreclosing on everything. And well, that's not the bank's business model. Foreclosures are a necessary evil to try and recoup losses, but if everyone is fired, then they're going to have to foreclose on literally everything. This is what we saw during the Great Recession, the 2008 Great Recession, was that foreclosures went up. And nobody wins in that situation. So, that's what we want to avoid as well.\r\n\r\nSo, when you look at the incentive structure for these four primary pillars, you can see that everyone wants the economy to keep going, but businesses also want to fire all of their employees as soon as they can. So then, what do you do to replace that? And this is all fundamentally coming because of what's called labor substitution. It's also called creative destruction, although that's more about you create a new industry by destroying an old one. So, for instance, tractors and farm automation and farm machinery destroyed the old way of doing farms. So, that way, you created new industries such as the tractor industry. So, creative destruction is kind of the large-scale pattern, but labor substitution is what happens when a machine simply just replaces a human one-to-one. All right, so that's a recap of Lecture One. Now, on to...\r\n\r\n### Economic Agency\r\n\r\nLecture Two: First and foremost, economic agency. You need to understand economic agency. Taking a big step back, whenever people say, 'I like, I want my job,' or, 'You know, I want good health insurance,' or whatever, what you're really saying is that you want economic agency. Economic agency is the underpinning psychological need, or civil principle, that underpins the need for things like labor rights and those sorts of things. But to define economic agency: economic agency represents an individual's capacity to shape their financial destiny through established rights and social mechanisms. This foundational concept faces unprecedented disruption when automation eliminates traditional pathways to economic participation.\r\n\r\nThere are three primary categories of economic agency in modern civil societies. Number one is labor rights. The right to work, organize, and negotiate fair compensation provides the primary avenue through which most people secure economic stability. If you remember from civics class, you know, the labor organization and unionization was a really big thing a century ago. It's been declining here in America for about the last century because labor rights, or unions in particular, distort the market a little bit, and neoliberalism specifically became more hostile to unions. So, we have a 'right to work' paradigm right now, which is basically you can work for anyone at any time, and you can be fired at any time. And there's not going to be any union interference. Now, while unions are really good for quality of life, they're very bad for economic efficiency in the grand scheme of things. It's a complicated story. I'm neither pro nor against unions. They have served a purpose, but honestly, I just want to get away from work. So, I want to get to a place where unions are irrelevant. That's my utopian goal. All right. So, labor rights is pillar number one.\r\n\r\nPillar number two is property rights. Ownership of assets enables wealth accumulation, financial security, and generational transfer of economic value. If you read the book *Why Nations Fail*, they really, really go into property rights as the cornerstone of progress. The ability to start a company and then make that company more valuable and then sell that company to someone else. The ability to create intellectual property, the ability to sell goods and services, and to have ownership of those items, or even some of those ideas through patent law. This is absolutely necessary for a modern liberal democracy to function. It is absolutely necessary for innovation and market progress. Now, I know some people out there have asked me questions, and I'll probably address this in a future video: 'What happens to things like copyright law and IP law in the future?' That's a good question. I'll be talking to a lot of people about that coming up here soon.\r\n\r\nThe third pillar is voting rights. So, democratic participation allows citizens to influence economic policies, regulations, and structural opportunities. One of the most remarkable things about liberal democracies is that we can elect a new, you know, head of state, whether it's a president or prime minister or whatever. And so, we can change the economic temperature, we can change the economic paradigm, relatively quickly in democratic societies, generally every four years. Then, of course, you have staggered midterm elections, so you have state and federal, so you have two tiers. And then you have House of Representatives, Senate, and presidency, at least here in America. And through indirect means, we can really change the tune or change the tempo of how we feel about the way that the economy is going. That is a huge, huge innovation over stagnant monarchies and other totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, namely Russia and China right now, North Korea as well, although they're not as major of a player on the global stage.\r\n\r\nSo, this trifecta forms the social contract right now. So, there was a very silly comment on the first lecture that said, 'I didn't sign no social contract,' missing the point. Anyway, the social contract, in effect, basically is the implicit or explicit agreed-upon paradigm where you have labor rights, property rights, and voting rights, and the rest is more or less up to you to figure out how to navigate the society. As we talked about in Lecture One, labor rights might become irrelevant. It might become a moot point if nobody's willing to hire you because of automation, because of AI, robots. Globalization and offshoring has been the biggest threat. Immigration has also been a big threat for the last few decades. Now, there's a new threat to jobs. Even if there's work to be done, there's no physical reason that it must be a human doing that work, and that's where automation comes in. So, that is the principle of economic agency. What comes...\r\n\r\n### Economic Agency Paradox\r\n\r\nNext is economic agency paradox. So, here's economic agency paradox in a nutshell: Automation simultaneously promises liberation from mundane labor while threatening the economic foundations of consumer purchasing power. This central contradiction creates potential systemic collapse when wage-earning opportunities vanish, but consumer spending remains essential. In other words, if you don't have a job, you don't spend any money. And if you don't spend any money, the economy collapses. And the reason that that is the main paradox is because we'll have this automation ability to turn the economy red-hot, but instead, it's actually going to stall unless we can shore up aggregate demand. So, what is aggregate demand?\r\n\r\n### Aggregate Demand\r\n\r\nAggregate demand is... modern economic systems fundamentally rely on widespread consumer purchasing power to drive production, innovation, and growth. The fact that we have, I think in America, there's like 148 million or 160 million households. Every household needs to buy electricity, goods, computers, internet services, food, all of that. So, that is what we call aggregate demand. From a macroeconomic policy, from a national policy perspective, you say, 'Okay, everyone can find their own ways to make money. Everyone has their own way of meeting, you know, their needs for economic agency. Whether you want to be a landlord, whether you want to be a programmer, whether you want to be a venture capitalist, it doesn't matter at the individual level.' When you're looking at it from a national level, at the national level, you just want to say, 'How much money are consumers willing and able to spend in the economy on an annual or quarterly basis?' And so, if jobs go down, aggregate demand goes down. And that is one of the key metrics that is measured and tracked to keep the economy running.\r\n\r\nAs we already talked about labor substitution, competitive pressures inevitably drive businesses to adopt automation that eliminates human employment across all sectors. As soon as a machine is better, faster, cheaper, and safer, it becomes inevitable that you're going to fire humans in favor of the machine. That has always happened. Same reason that we don't have that many farmhands anymore is because modern combines, you know, John Deere, replaces literally millions of man-hour worth of labor. And you can just have Jeremy Clarkson up on his big Lamborghini tractor do hundreds of human man-hour worth of labor from his tractor, and he's like 70-something years old, right? So, that's, that has been the nature of automation. It's just now automation is getting more intelligent. And also, automation is taking our form factor, not just the shape of a tractor. Automation is going to take the shape of human bodies where they're going to be more dextrous, more agile, stronger, and be able to work around the clock. So, labor substitution becomes inevitable eventually.\r\n\r\nNow, some of you out there in the comments have been asking, 'When is this going to happen?' I've been trying to model the uptake of this. So, for Software as a Service, the TL;DR is that adoption curves are about seven to eight years from an introduction of a new technology to 80 to 90% saturation. So, this is year one of computer-using agents. So, that means that it's like at the ground floor right now. And that means that in seven to eight years, so about 2031, 2032, 2033, we're going to be at 80 to 90-plus percent saturation, meaning every company that can do KVM jobs\u2014that's keyboard, video, mouse jobs\u2014will have very few employees doing those jobs. And of course, there might be limits to what those computer-using agents can do. But that labor substitution is coming. It's going to take a little bit longer for robots to really scale up. And that's just because supply lines, factories, there's... the marginal cost of creating more robots is always higher than just creating more agents, because an agent is an ephemeral piece of software. It's just data.\r\n\r\nAnyway, moving on. So, if we end up with this, with this scheme where labor substitution is happening broad-spectrum very quickly, then aggregate demand goes down, and we end up in an economic death spiral. Declining wages lead to reduced consumer spending, triggering business failures, innovation stagnation, and comprehensive economic collapse. I am not the only person afraid of this. Everyone from Goldman Sachs to Brookings Institute to World Economic Forum, everyone at the highest echelons of global economics is looking at how do we solve this contradiction, how do we solve this paradox. And as many of you have pointed out in the comments, it doesn't even have to get to 100%. If we just get to 20 or 30% unemployment, that's bad enough. Consider that I think the highest unemployment we saw during the Great Depression was 25 to 28%, and that was catastrophic. So, if we get to 20% unemployment, that's nearly... I mean, that would already be catastrophic to most people, but we're looking at 30 to 40% unemployment as a very real possibility due to artificial intelligence and robots. That would be catastrophic.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem is distribution. The core challenge involves allocating purchasing power without traditional wage mechanisms when machines generate economic value. Right now, the primary distribution mechanism is you find work. So, like the decentralized, distributed social hive mind of humanity, you're trying to find work. So, there's the labor market. So, there's supply and demand of labor. So, you find the most valuable job that you can do. And that is how we... and, you know, the invisible hand, although to be fair, Adam Smith only used 'invisible hand' once or twice, and it was never really directly... it was not referring to the market as a whole. Anyway, the invisible hand of the market is rational self-interest, where, 'Hey, I don't want to starve, and I don't want to lose my house, so let me go find the best job that I can do.' And the best job that's out there that I can do is someone needs me to do something, right? So, if that distribution problem breaks down, we need a replacement distribution mechanism. And as you'll see by the end of this video, property makes the most sense. Decentralized markets, current markets, distribute wealth through labor-wage exchanges based on scarcity principles that become invalid when automation eliminates labor demand, or basically eliminates labor scarcity. So, economies are always based on optimizing around scarcity. Right now, human labor is actually the scarcest input to all economic activity. That's why building a house, like the single biggest bucket that money goes into for building a house, is labor. It's 30 to 40% of the cost of a house is the labor that went into it. That's more than any other single asset or resource, unless it's a house that sits on a really big piece of land.\r\n\r\n### Current Aggregate Demand\r\n\r\nAs we're drilling deeper into this problem, you say, 'Okay, from a macro perspective, we want to shore up aggregate demand.' Where does aggregate demand come from? Consumer purchasing power flows primarily from three sources, which require fundamental rebalancing in an automated economy. The current distribution heavily relies, heavily favors wages that would be dramatically reduced through automation displacement. So, those three buckets are: wages. Labor compensation constitutes approximately 60% of total consumer demand in the current economy. Property asset ownership generates roughly 20% of consumer purchasing power through dividends, rents, and capital gains transfers. Government disbursements account for approximately 19% of customer spending through retirement, unemployment, SNAP, and other entitlement programs. That also includes Medicare and Medicaid. So, basically, some of your ability to demand goods and services comes from the government. And this is in aggregate.\r\n\r\nNow, some of you might say, 'But actually, 90% of my income comes from wages.' If you're a prime-age worker, which is 25 to 54, there is a good chance that the majority of your income, your purchasing power, comes from wages. It's only once you get older, or if you're born rich or whatever, that more will come from property. And also, only once you're older or disabled or whatever, that you get more of it from transfers. It also varies per county. So, one of the things that as I've been researching this, poor rural counties will have up to 30% transfers, sometimes a little bit more, whereas rich, high-tech counties will have very, very low property, or sorry, very low transfers and higher property and wages. So, that's one of the fundamental differences. So, this ratio is going to shift. Automation will significantly diminish wages as a primary source of consumer purchasing power, creating fundamental economic imbalance. Again, if wages go down, property and transfers have to pick up the slack. Transfers would be UBI, but we don't want to overly rely on UBI. So, that's the necessary adjustments.\r\n\r\nSo, here's a way to visualize it. Right now, the aggregate demand in America is roughly 60-20-20. So, that's the current income mix of wages. So, in aggregate, looking at all of America, if you were to put it all into one big giant bucket, 60% of aggregate demand comes from wages, 20% comes from property, and 20% comes from transfers. Now, wages are not going to go away completely. As we've talked about in plenty of other videos, many jobs are going to be vulnerable to automation. In fact, most jobs, or a significant portion of jobs, are going to be vulnerable to automation. Pretty much anything that you do in front of a computer is vulnerable to automation. Skilled labor, such as electricians and plumbers, once robots really take off in the late 2030s, mid to late 2030s, all of those jobs are going to be vulnerable as well. Now, typically in the past, labor dislocation has created jobs elsewhere, but as I have stated in this lecture series and in other places, just because demand goes up or there's hypothetical capital that has been liberated for other things, there's not really any reason that those new services and goods must be provided by humans. Historically, those new goods and services were provided by humans just because we didn't have automation. So, in the future though, we can expect wages to go down dramatically. There's still going to be plenty of things: the experience economy, the meaning economy, attention economy, all of those are probably going to stick around. Humans just intrinsically find humans interesting, and we find interactions with humans to be more rewarding, unless you're ultra-autistic like some of us, and I prefer to interact with machines. Ask me about when I had to buy a new car from a car dealership. It was the worst experience that I've had all year. Anyway, rant aside, the mix that we probably want to see in the future is something more like this, where you have 20% of aggregate demand comes from residual wages, 60% comes from property, and only 20% comes from transfers. Now, you might argue that you want this to go up a little bit more. But what if we just replace a lot of those entitlement programs with UBI, and everyone gets it? So, instead of retirement, instead of Medicare and SNAP and all of those other things, what if everyone just gets a UBI? So, but this is just a good visualization so you get a basic idea. Also, I apologize if I'm in front of the graphic, but you get the idea. So, this is where we're at. This is where we want to be. So then, the question becomes, how do we increase the amount of property that people have? We're going to dive into that in all the interventions that we can do in a future video, but we'll do a little bit in this video.\r\n\r\nSo, first and foremost though, UBI: necessary but not sufficient. This is one of my most unpopular opinions with some people. So, let's dive into it. Universal Basic Income represents an essential but incomplete solution to the automation displacement problem, providing a minimum economic floor while requiring substantial tax increases to fund implementation. Number one: central control. Government administration creates problematic financial dependency and excessive state influence over citizen economic freedom. First and foremost, you do not want to put all your eggs in one basket, and you do not want to be a financial patient of the government. Just look at how, you know, when someone accidentally gets their checks cut off and the government is too slow and too incompetent to say, 'Oh, well, someone filed it wrong, and here's a death certificate that says that you died, so now you're actually committing fraud.' And this happens all the time, by the way, with Social Security checks. So, you do not want central control where an apathetic, incompetent, slow-moving bureaucracy is responsible for your entire economic fate.\r\n\r\nNext is market distortions. Pure UBI implementation undermines critical price signals by treating recipients identically regardless of circumstances or location. One of the strengths of UBI is that it's equal for everyone. That's also one of the weaknesses of UBI. It doesn't matter, like, you know, cost of living is going to change, your individual needs are going to change. So, one of the primary problems with UBI is that it's like, let's just say the UBI is $2,000 per adult citizen. Okay, is that really going to work if you're in New York City or San Francisco? It's going to be a really big difference if you're out in rural Wyoming, where $2,000 a month might be all that you really need. In New York City or San Francisco, that's not even going to cover a third of rent. So, UBI would then encourage different migration patterns and those sorts of things. So, that is technically a kind of market distortion where everyone gets the same thing. So, UBI is necessary, but you don't want it to be too high. Now, I know some people are like, 'What about what Elon Musk said with Universal High Income?' Elon Musk is not a banker, and he's also not a governance expert. So, take everything Elon Musk says about UHI with a grain of salt. Now, what I will agree with though is that's the ultimate goal. By the time post-labor economics is fully implemented, by around 2040, I hope, we'll be on an upward trajectory where you'd be getting the equivalent of $120,000 per year without doing anything in today's dollars.\r\n\r\nSo, next is inflation. Increased currency velocity without corresponding production growth threatens purchasing power erosion through inflationary pressure. This is one of the things that we saw with the stimulus checks that went out during the pandemic is they were very popular, but they also did cause some inflation. Now, we also know that some of the inflation was due to other distortions such as shipping problems. If demand goes down, or sorry, if supply goes down and demand stays the same, then prices go up. So, the pandemic inflation was complicated, but certainly, spending trillions of dollars on stimulus checks was a part of it. So, that's, that is an unsolved problem in terms of, even if we wanted to do UBI tomorrow, there's going to be unintended consequences.\r\n\r\nNext is tax flight. Excessive taxation required for funding UBI risks triggering capital exodus and talent migration for more favorable jurisdictions. The more taxes you pay, the more acutely you are aware of and trying to optimize your tax havens. So, in some of the conversations that are having and that are going to continue, some of this has to actually be a global solution so that you pay taxes anywhere. Some of the things that people are proposing is a global wealth fund so that wherever you go, if a billionaire leaves America and goes to Europe or Australia or somewhere else, they're still going to be paying taxes to a global wealth fund. This is just a hypothetical. I don't know if that's a good idea, but that's just one of the ideas being floated out there. Now, another thing to keep in mind is that UBI does not have to come from federal. One of the oversights that I see out there in the conversations is that UBI must be a federal thing or a global thing. But when you look at some of the experiments being done, there are UBIs that are being trialed at the municipal, state, and federal levels. So, what that can do is you might actually ultimately end up getting UBI checks from your city, from your county, from your state, and your federal government, which is better because you're not getting it all from one place, and it can be adjusted to the cost of living to your particular city or state, hypothetically speaking.\r\n\r\n### Property Overhaul\r\n\r\nNow, next is the property overhaul. So, if you believe this graph and you say, 'All right, we need more property, but what if people don't have any buy-in? What are some ways that we can create this new property paradigm without buy-in?' Because obviously, if you already have money, you can buy into this new system, and who cares? But most people don't have the spare income to buy into this new scheme. So, how do you create a paradigm in which you can? Now, I've been doing some work on this, and I actually have a blog post, link above or below or wherever, where I've got 16 different interventions that can be employed that require various levels of buy-in. But I wanted to provide just an overview of a couple of options that are pretty potent and familiar. So, alternative ownership structures must expand dramatically to maintain economic agency when wages collapse. That's the entire point of post-labor economics. Numerous proven models exist to distribute asset ownership broadly across the population.\r\n\r\nNumber one is trusts. Public and private trust structures enable collective ownership of capital assets, sharing returns across broad beneficiary populations. Now, some trusts you need to buy into, some you don't. Some are based on residency. So, the Alaska Permanent Fund, the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, all of those are just based on citizenship and residency. No buy-in is required. And furthermore, the fact that trusts are very well tested, they're constitutionally sound, the governance is well understood. We have established best practices. Trusts could be a good component. Now, as many of you will point out, a trust alone doesn't really make that big of a difference if it only pays out, you know, $1,000 a year or $2,000 a year. But when you have a portfolio of many of these interventions, like I said, I've got a list of 16 interventions, they add up, and they also accumulate and compound over time.\r\n\r\nSo, next is wealth funds. So, sovereign and community wealth funds create public endowments, generating returns for citizens without relying on wage income. These also exist. There's actually a proposal right now of creating a national sovereign wealth fund here in America. I don't know if it's going to get created, but I think the number that they were floating was something like $5 trillion, which sounds like a lot, but that's only going to generate, you know, a few hundred to a few thousand per citizen per year. But it's a start, and it can grow over time.\r\n\r\nNext is stock options. So, there are all kinds of ways that you can create stock options. So, first is an ESOP, which is an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. So, if you work somewhere, you can take part of your wages in the form of shares. I did this when I worked at Cisco, and it was great, because Cisco kept a pool of shares and would give them to you at a discount every, I think it was every quarter or every month. So, I put like 20% of my salary towards shares, which I then got at a discount. So, it was like an immediate 20% boost to my income. So, that's one option. But if wages go away, if employment goes away for most cases, then that's not really an option on the table. So then, another few options are: one is a customer equity program, which is basically you add on like a one to four or five percent sales tax. And so, every time you purchase something from a store, you actually get a fractional share. And so, every time you spend, you get more. And then, so then you get dividends on those shares over time. So, the longer you patronize, it's like a kickback program or a rewards program. You know, you get a Target card, you get a rebate, right? You sometimes get $5 back immediately. It's that kind of thing, but instead of just immediate cash back, you get shares. Another one is where you'd have transfer ownership via taxes. So, basically, a company could pay some of their taxes, their corporate taxes, in the form of shares given to wealth funds, particularly non-voting, dividend-generating shares would be the ideal way to go. Cashback programs such as loyalty systems\u2014so that's like, you know, your credit card and your flyer miles and stuff, those are loyalty programs\u2014and other local incentives. So, for instance, getting more cash back if you spend locally, or participate in circular economies. Cooperatives: so, royalties from carbon sequestration, spectrum, solar, data centers, and other infrastructure cooperatives. All of these exist. And these are just five of the interventions, five of the 16 interventions that I've identified so far. So, the idea here though is that many of, some of these do require some buy-in, or buy-in is optional. But the more property you have, you end up starting up a flywheel where the investments and the reinvestments from those compound over time. Now, I have modeled this, and we'll talk about this more in the modeling and measurements and KPI in the future lectures, but I just wanted to prime the pump with some ideas up front.\r\n\r\n### Market-Based Solutions\r\n\r\nNext is market-based solutions. Basically, you want as little government intervention as possible. So, market-based solutions is one of the primary goals of post-labor economics: finding decentralized, distributed methods. So, market-based approaches offer superior alternatives to centrally planned systems while preserving economic agency in a post-labor world. These solutions align with established economic frameworks while distributing ownership broadly across the population.\r\n\r\nProperty primacy, number one: Strong private property rights form the foundation of all economically successful nations and must be expanded to include more citizens. We want to double down on property rights. We not go the other way where 'you will own nothing and be happy.' I'm literally saying the opposite of 'you will own nothing and be happy.' This is a solar punk future where you own everything, and the elites own less, and certainly the government owns less.\r\n\r\nMarket solutions: Allowing competitive forces to allocate resources produces more efficient outcomes than centralized management by government entities or larger polities or billionaires.\r\n\r\nNext is the coordination mechanism. New frameworks must replace the wage-labor social contract as automation eliminates traditional employment relationships. Property is the new coordination mechanism. You vote with your wallet, and also your zip code and your shopping cart.\r\n\r\nNext is participatory ownership. Collective purchasing power through counties and banks enables individuals to aggregate resources and acquire meaningful ownership stakes. This is one of the key things that people have brought up as concerns in the comments: 'If I don't have any purchasing power at the beginning, how do I buy in?' In the same way that unions allowed for collective bargaining of labor rights, your bank, your credit union, and your county will allow for collective purchasing power so that you can punch above your weight and say, 'Hey, we want to build a world-class solar farm or data center or something else in this county.' So, let's join forces. And it's not necessarily just, you know, approve the county to take out a loan. There are better ways of doing it.\r\n\r\nAnd number one: voluntary adoption. The most effective solutions must naturally attract all stakeholders\u2014banks, businesses, governments, and consumers\u2014through mutual benefit rather than mandate. One of the biggest mistakes that governments could make is doing a lot of this through force, basically saying, 'You must do all these new things.' Now, that's not to say that some things must be compulsory, taxes for instance. There are many aspects that are compulsory, but really the finesse, the nuanced approach, is going to be creating options that are voluntary and organic. And so, those will create the fewest market distortions, and they'll also be adopted the most organically and naturally.\r\n\r\n### Banks\r\n\r\nThe role of banks. So, we're almost done. Banks serve as the central hub of the post-labor economic ecosystem, providing critical infrastructure and services. Financial institutions, from local credit unions to international centers, will become your primary economic touchpoint as labor income diminishes. In other words, your relationship with your bank or banks will replace your relationship with your employers. So, first and foremost, banks are user-friendly. One of the main concerns that I've seen percolating up is, 'Dave, everything that you're proposing sounds great, but it sounds so complex. Not everyone is going to be able to manage it.' And I absolutely agree, which is why it should be managed through your bank. And by the way, you can choose your bank. You can choose which credit union or which commercial bank or retail bank you go with. So, the market efficiency for discovery will still be there. The competition between banks for customers will still be there. And fundamentally, you say, 'Well, what are they competing over?' UBI is necessary, and that's where some money is injected at the bottom. So, essentially, banks will be competing over some of the UBI that everyone is getting, plus the other business that they generate. But number one, banks are user-friendly. Financial institutions translate complex economic paradigms into accessible interfaces through local branches and mobile apps that manage sophisticated ownership mechanisms. From your perspective, you just get money in the bank. You can make more decisions. You can play with it like you play with stock markets and those sorts of things. You're welcome to do that, but most people are probably just going to delegate it to the bank. Say, 'You know, manage it for me. All I want to see is my dividends accruing every week.'\r\n\r\n### KYC Expertise\r\n\r\nNext up is KYC expertise. So, 'Know Your Customer.' Banks provide established solutions for identity management, security, privacy, and compliance that emerging tech technologies like blockchain and DAOs have yet to solve effectively. So, basically, proof of humanity. Sam Altman is trying to solve this problem that doesn't really exist with his Worldcoin orb thing. Nobody cares, right? The banks don't really care. Banks have ways of establishing your identity. If anything, blockchain-based and crypto-based solutions will just be an additional layer on top of it. But at the same time, proof of stake and proof of ownership, that's what banks are for. That's literally why banks have existed for hundreds of years. So, yeah, that's a solved problem. And so, this creates an anchor where maybe all of your crypto and all of your tokens and all of your proof-of-stake tokens go through your bank. I would like to see that as an option.\r\n\r\nNext is investment management. Banking professionals automatically handle diverse investment accounts, dividends, kickbacks, and depositing proceeds without customer intervention while managing regulatory compliance. Again, it compresses it all into a service. And so, the service that you get is they make sure that you get your dividends, they make sure that you get your voting rights, they make sure that you get your cooperative rebates and everything else. And they handle the complexity, and what they get is servicing fees, and they get to service your debt as well. So, that's the mutually beneficial relationship between you and banks, which banks already do that right now, but they're pretty conservative with it. You can get a CD account, which will pay like, I don't know, 3% per year, but we need to get that up to like 8 to 12% per year.\r\n\r\nNext is technical nerve center. Financial institutions connect with all payment rails, such as FedNow, RTP, and can replace employers as the command center of economic well-being through voluntary association. Again, by choosing where you bank and which banks you qualify for, just in some cases, just by being a member of a bank, you will start to reap some of those benefits. And then the direct incentives: banks, particularly local institutions, have inherent motivation to adopt post-labor economic models as they benefit directly from customer financial success through deeper community investment. So, incentive alignment between you and your local bank will ensure that they actually want to adopt these policies in the long run.\r\n\r\n### Role of County\r\n\r\nAnd then, Role of County. So, the other centerpiece of post-labor economics is going to be your local county, mostly due to the principle of subsidiarity, or economic subsidiarity. And this is the last slide, I promise. Counties provide the ideal governing scale to implement and test post-labor economic initiatives. That's not saying that it should be limited to counties; states and federal governments will participate as well. But starting with counties is good because we have 3,100 counties here in America. So, that's a lot of test beds. Their unique position in the governance hierarchy offers operational advantages while maintaining community connection.\r\n\r\nNumber one is the sweet spot scale. Counties are small enough to implement changes without gridlock, yet large enough to generate meaningful economic data and serve as scalable models. They also control the most zoning information.\r\n\r\nNext is economic asset control. Counties directly own valuable revenue-generating assets, including land, utility franchises, infrastructure easements, and zoning authority that can feed community endowment funds. This is also true of states, by the way. Again, I'm just recommending that we start with counties just because they're small. There are many of them, and they're going to be, there's going to be a lot more flexible testing.\r\n\r\nNext is existing infrastructure implementation. It leverages established county systems for property records, tax assessment, residency verification, and dividend disbursement without building from scratch. So, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, we can just start with counties that already exist, and we can empower counties with some more of these economic tools. Meaning that, you know, in a post-labor economy, some of your income, some of your residual income, is going to be coming directly from the county, some from the state, some from the federal government, and other voluntary choices like who you bank with, and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as an ideological testing ground, the political diversity across counties enables cross-partisan validation of post-labor economic models while revealing region-specific opportunities like solar co-ops or timber royalties or carbon sequestration or whatever else.\r\n\r\nAnd then community legitimacy. Local governance fosters accountability and trust when residents receive economic benefits as county officials live alongside constituents affected by their decisions. This is the primary principle of subsidiarity, which is push all the decisions out to as local as you can, and this includes economic decisions, which is one of the cornerstones of post-labor economics.\r\n\r\nThank you for watching to the end. Episode Three, or Lecture Three, will be about measurements and KPI. What do you measure? How do you know if you're vulnerable for post-labor economics? How do you know if you're ready? How do you know if it's going right? So on and so forth. Yeah, that's it. Thanks for watching.

This series aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of post-labor economics as of 2025. This lecture focuses on the concept of economic agency, specifically examining what individuals require to meaningfully participate in the economy.\n\n### Recap of Lecture One: \"Better, Faster, Cheaper, Safer\"\n\nBefore proceeding, let us review the content of Lecture One, titled \"Better, Faster, Cheaper, Safer.\" The key thesis is as follows: once machines become better, faster, cheaper, and safer than humans, labor substitution becomes an economic inevitability. After establishing the inevitability of labor substitution, we examined the economy from the perspective of four primary pillars of economic participation:\n\n1. **Consumers:**  \n   Consumers\u2014referred to in earlier paradigms as workers\u2014become the foundational category once traditional labor is displaced. Consumers, or households, engage in markets by purchasing goods and services. Meaningful participation in society and the market requires economic agency, which is traditionally secured through wages, property ownership, and democratic participation.\n\n2. **Businesses:**  \n   Businesses seek to minimize labor costs and, ideally, would employ zero employees. However, this creates a paradox: without employed consumers, businesses lose their customer base, resulting in a collapse of aggregate demand and, subsequently, a breakdown of the wage-labor social contract.\n\n3. **Government:**  \n   Governments aim to maintain tax revenues, demographic stability, and geopolitical standing, while minimizing intervention in the market. However, if widespread unemployment occurs, citizens may react with unrest or revolution, as has been observed throughout history when economic agency declines to unsustainable levels. Electoral outcomes are often determined by how well the economy serves consumers, reinforcing the government\u2019s stake in maintaining jobs and economic participation.\n\n4. **Banks:**  \n   Banks serve as the infrastructure connecting all economic stakeholders, requiring depositors to have sufficient funds for transactions and debt servicing. Banks\u2019 business models depend on issuing and collecting on loans and mortgages; widespread insolvency among customers, as witnessed during the 2008 Great Recession, leads to systemic failures that benefit no one.\n\nEach of these pillars has incentives to sustain economic activity, yet businesses are incentivized to automate labor as soon as it becomes feasible. This creates the central problem addressed in this lecture and is the inevitable outcome of labor substitution, sometimes discussed under the broader term \"creative destruction.\" While creative destruction refers to the emergence of new industries through the obsolescence of old ones, labor substitution refers to the direct, one-to-one replacement of humans with machines.\n\n### Economic Agency: Definition and Foundations\n\nThe primary theme of Lecture Two is economic agency. It is essential to clearly understand this concept. When individuals express desires for secure employment or comprehensive health insurance, they are fundamentally expressing a need for economic agency\u2014the psychological and civil foundation underlying labor rights and related principles. Economic agency can be defined as an individual\u2019s capacity to shape their financial future through established rights and social mechanisms. This foundational principle faces unprecedented disruption when automation removes traditional pathways to economic participation.\n\nModern civil societies recognize three main categories of economic agency:\n\n1. **Labor Rights:**  \n   The rights to work, organize, and negotiate fair compensation form the principal means by which most individuals attain economic stability. Historically, labor organizations and unionization were significant forces in securing these rights. However, in the United States, union power has declined over the last century as neoliberal economic policies have become dominant, emphasizing individual choice over collective bargaining. While unions have improved quality of life, they are often criticized for reducing overall economic efficiency. The broader objective, however, is to move toward a society where labor rights become less relevant because work itself is no longer the foundation of economic agency.\n\n2. **Property Rights:**  \n   Asset ownership is essential for wealth accumulation, financial security, and intergenerational transfer of economic value. As discussed in *Why Nations Fail*, property rights are the cornerstone of societal progress. The ability to start and grow businesses, create intellectual property, and own and transfer goods and services underpins innovation and market development. The future of copyright and intellectual property law will require further examination as automation progresses.\n\n3. **Voting Rights:**  \n   Democratic participation empowers citizens to influence economic policy, regulations, and structural opportunities. Liberal democracies, through regular elections and political pluralism, allow the rapid adjustment of economic paradigms, contrasting sharply with authoritarian regimes, which remain inflexible and unresponsive to popular needs.\n\nThese three pillars collectively form the modern social contract. Regardless of explicit consent, individuals are embedded within a system defined by labor rights, property rights, and voting rights, navigating society according to these parameters. As labor rights potentially become obsolete due to automation, property and voting rights gain increased importance. Historically, globalization, offshoring, and immigration have posed challenges to employment, but the advent of automation presents a qualitatively different threat: the elimination of the necessity for human labor.\n\n### The Economic Agency Paradox\n\nA central paradox emerges in the age of automation: automation promises freedom from repetitive labor but simultaneously threatens the purchasing power essential for a functioning consumer economy. If individuals are unemployed, they lack the means to spend; without consumer spending, the entire economy risks collapse. Automation could potentially accelerate economic productivity, but without addressing aggregate demand, this potential will remain unrealized.\n\n### Aggregate Demand and Its Determinants\n\nModern economies depend on broad-based consumer purchasing power\u2014aggregate demand\u2014to sustain production, drive innovation, and enable growth. The United States, for example, has approximately 148\u2013160 million households, each consuming a variety of goods and services. From a macroeconomic policy perspective, aggregate demand is measured as the total amount consumers are willing and able to spend over a given period. Declining employment translates directly to declining aggregate demand, undermining the stability of the entire economic system.\n\nAs labor substitution proceeds, competitive pressures compel businesses to automate, eliminating human employment sector by sector. Once machines become demonstrably superior, the replacement of human labor becomes inevitable\u2014a trend that has recurred throughout industrial history. Whereas earlier mechanization primarily replaced physical labor, contemporary automation increasingly targets cognitive labor, especially through computer-based agents. Uptake models for new technology, such as Software as a Service, suggest an adoption period of seven to eight years to achieve 80\u201390% market saturation. As a result, by approximately 2031\u20132033, the majority of roles involving keyboard, video, and mouse inputs may be automated, with physical automation following as robotic technology matures.\n\nIf automation proceeds unchecked, aggregate demand will decline, resulting in an economic \"death spiral.\" Wages will fall, consumer spending will decrease, business failures will multiply, innovation will stagnate, and the economy will collapse. This risk is not hypothetical\u2014analysts at Goldman Sachs, the Brookings Institution, and the World Economic Forum, among others, recognize this as a critical global challenge. Even partial displacement (e.g., 20\u201330% unemployment) would have catastrophic consequences, as evidenced by the Great Depression, where peak unemployment reached 25\u201328%.\n\nThe central problem, therefore, is the distribution of purchasing power. With machines creating economic value, but traditional wage mechanisms vanishing, new distribution models must be established. Historically, decentralized markets have distributed wealth through labor-wage exchanges rooted in scarcity. However, automation eliminates the scarcity of human labor, rendering this model obsolete. Presently, labor is often the scarcest and costliest input to economic activity\u2014for example, labor can account for 30\u201340% of the cost of building a house.\n\n### Sources of Aggregate Demand\n\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, consumer purchasing power currently derives from three primary sources. These will require fundamental rebalancing as automation erodes wage-based income:\n\n1. **Wages:**  \n   Labor compensation comprises approximately 60% of total consumer demand in the present economy.\n\n2. **Property Asset Ownership:**  \n   Asset income, including dividends, rents, and capital gains, accounts for about 20% of consumer purchasing power.\n\n3. **Government Transfers:**  \n   Transfers\u2014including retirement benefits, unemployment assistance, SNAP, Medicare, and Medicaid\u2014constitute approximately 19% of consumer spending.\n\nWhile individual experiences vary\u2014prime-age workers receive the majority of income from wages, while older or wealthier individuals rely more on property or transfers\u2014this aggregate ratio highlights the challenge. Automation will severely reduce wages as a share of purchasing power. To maintain aggregate demand, property income and transfers must compensate for the decline in wages. Although Universal Basic Income (UBI) may help, overreliance on transfers poses its own risks.\n\nA visualization of the desired future income mix would see 20% of aggregate demand from residual wages, 60% from property, and 20% from transfers, as opposed to the current 60-20-20 split. While some roles will persist in the \"experience economy,\" \"meaning economy,\" and \"attention economy,\" the overall wage share is expected to fall dramatically. Future entitlement programs might be replaced with UBI, but this alone is insufficient.\n\n### Universal Basic Income: Necessary but Not Sufficient\n\nUniversal Basic Income offers a partial solution to the challenges of automation-induced displacement by providing a minimum income floor. However, significant challenges remain:\n\n1. **Central Control:**  \n   Excessive financial dependency on government exposes citizens to bureaucratic inefficiency and the risk of administrative errors, such as erroneous benefit terminations.\n\n2. **Market Distortions:**  \n   Uniform UBI payments ignore individual needs and cost-of-living variations, creating unintended consequences such as population migration and mismatched resource allocation.\n\n3. **Inflationary Pressures:**  \n   Injecting additional income into the economy without a corresponding increase in production can lead to inflation, as observed with pandemic-era stimulus payments.\n\n4. **Tax Flight:**  \n   The substantial tax increases required to fund UBI could incentivize capital flight and talent migration unless coordinated globally\u2014potentially via a global wealth fund. UBI programs need not be exclusively federal; localized implementation (municipal, state, and federal) can offer flexibility and responsiveness to regional needs.\n\n### Property Ownership Overhaul\n\nGiven the necessity of expanding property-based income, the next critical question is how to enable broad participation in property ownership, especially for those without existing wealth. Numerous models can support this objective:\n\n1. **Trusts:**  \n   Public and private trusts facilitate collective ownership of capital assets, distributing returns to broad populations. Examples include the Alaska Permanent Fund and the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, which allocate dividends based on residency or citizenship.\n\n2. **Wealth Funds:**  \n   Sovereign and community wealth funds create public endowments, providing returns without reliance on wages. Proposals for national funds, such as a $5 trillion U.S. sovereign wealth fund, demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.\n\n3. **Stock Options:**  \n   Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and customer equity programs distribute ownership through wage substitution or consumption. Other mechanisms include corporate tax payments in shares to wealth funds, loyalty programs, and cooperative ventures distributing dividends from shared infrastructure projects.\n\nThese mechanisms, when implemented in aggregate, can accumulate and compound wealth over time, gradually transforming the income structure.\n\n### Market-Based Solutions\n\nPost-labor economics favors decentralized, market-based solutions over centralized planning. These approaches maintain economic agency by distributing ownership and opportunity as broadly as possible:\n\n1. **Property Primacy:**  \n   Strengthening private property rights is foundational to economic success; ownership should be broadened rather than restricted.\n\n2. **Resource Allocation:**  \n   Market competition ensures more efficient resource allocation than central planning, whether by governments or large corporations.\n\n3. **New Coordination Mechanisms:**  \n   As traditional wage-labor contracts disappear, property ownership must replace employment as the principal economic coordination mechanism\u2014consumers express preferences through their purchasing decisions.\n\n4. **Participatory Ownership:**  \n   Collective purchasing\u2014through counties, banks, and credit unions\u2014enables individuals to aggregate resources and acquire meaningful stakes in productive assets.\n\n5. **Voluntary Adoption:**  \n   The most effective models will be those that attract participation from all stakeholders organically, rather than through compulsion. While certain policies (e.g., taxes) must be mandatory, the preferred approach is to maximize voluntary, mutually beneficial participation.\n\n### The Evolving Role of Banks\n\nBanks will become the central infrastructure of the post-labor economic system, replacing the traditional employer-employee relationship as the primary economic interface:\n\n1. **User-Friendliness:**  \n   Banks translate complex economic systems into accessible tools via branches and digital platforms. Most individuals will rely on banks to manage their investments and property-based income streams, delegating the complexities of investment management.\n\n2. **Identity and Compliance (KYC Expertise):**  \n   Banks provide established solutions for identity verification, security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. Unlike emerging blockchain technologies, banks have longstanding frameworks for proof of ownership and proof of humanity.\n\n3. **Investment Management:**  \n   Banks will handle the automatic management of diversified portfolios, dividend distributions, and compliance without requiring customer intervention, earning fees in exchange for these services.\n\n4. **Technical Nerve Center:**  \n   Banks connect to all major payment systems and can replace employers as the locus of financial well-being. Voluntary association with banks\u2014whether local or national\u2014ensures competition and incentive alignment with customers.\n\n5. **Direct Incentives:**  \n   Especially at the local level, banks have a direct interest in community prosperity, aligning their business models with the success of post-labor economic initiatives.\n\n### The Role of Counties in Post-Labor Economics\n\nCounties, due to the principle of subsidiarity, represent the optimal scale for implementing and testing post-labor economic reforms:\n\n1. **Optimal Scale:**  \n   Counties are sufficiently small to permit rapid policy experimentation while large enough to yield meaningful economic data. Their number and diversity in the United States (over 3,100 counties) provide ample opportunities for comparative analysis and innovation.\n\n2. **Control of Economic Assets:**  \n   Counties possess significant, revenue-generating assets\u2014land, utilities, infrastructure, and zoning authority\u2014which can be leveraged to fund community endowments and economic initiatives.\n\n3. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure:**  \n   Counties already manage property records, tax assessments, residency verification, and dividend disbursement, allowing reforms to be implemented without building new systems from the ground up.\n\n4. **Ideological Testing Ground:**  \n   The political and cultural diversity of counties enables robust cross-partisan validation of economic models and reveals region-specific opportunities, such as renewable energy cooperatives and natural resource royalties.\n\n5. **Community Legitimacy:**  \n   Local governance fosters accountability and trust, as officials live among and are directly accountable to the constituents benefiting from (or affected by) policy changes. Subsidiarity thus ensures decisions are made as locally as possible, enhancing legitimacy and effectiveness.\n\n---\n\nLecture Three will address the measurement of progress in post-labor economics, including the selection of key performance indicators and evaluation of readiness for transition."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"502d911d-341d-4af4-b911-cf679701f7d9","request_id":"94ada69edac48936-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"502d911d-341d-4af4-b911-cf679701f7d9","children":[]}}}
