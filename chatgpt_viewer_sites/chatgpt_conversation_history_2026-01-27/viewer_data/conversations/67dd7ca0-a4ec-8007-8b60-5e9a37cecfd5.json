Since gaining independence in 1965, Singapore\u2019s leaders have recognised that survival depends on **not aligning too closely** with any great power while cultivating broad partnerships. This imperative stems from Singapore\u2019s vulnerable position amid larger neighbors and superpower rivalries \u2013 necessitating a stance of being **\u201cfriends to all, enemies to none.\u201d** Over the decades, Singapore has pursued a pragmatic, **multidimensional strategy** \u2013 economically, militarily, diplomatically, and through soft power \u2013 to uphold its independence and avoid being forced into choosing sides. The following report provides a structured deep dive into how Singapore has historically worked toward neutrality and strategic autonomy across these dimensions, evaluates its success to date, and considers the path forward as U.S.-China tensions intensify.\n\n## Historical Overview: A Post-1965 Policy of Non-Alignment  \nIn the immediate post-independence period, Singapore\u2019s foreign policy was explicitly shaped by *non-alignment*. Upon joining the United Nations in 1965, Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam declared that Singapore would **\u201cchoose the path of non-alignment,\u201d** refusing to be drawn into any alliance aimed at imposing one bloc\u2019s ideology on others\u30105\u2020L104-L113\u3011. He affirmed that friendship between countries should not require **\u201ccommon ideologies, common friends and common foes\u201d\u30105\u2020L104-L113\u3011**, encapsulating Singapore\u2019s resolve to avoid taking sides in great power contests. During the Cold War, this translated into *strategic non-alignment* \u2013 *not* formally joining either the Western or Communist camp \u2013 even as Singapore pragmatically cooperated with various powers. For instance, while maintaining a non-aligned posture, Singapore quietly provided support facilities to the United States during the Vietnam War, serving as a critical refuelling and repair point for U.S. forces\u30102\u2020L342-L350\u3011\u30102\u2020L364-L372\u3011. American engagement in Southeast Asia thus helped Singapore economically and bolstered its security in the 1960s, even absent a formal alliance\u30102\u2020L342-L350\u3011. At the same time, Singapore studiously avoided antagonizing China or the Soviet Union, and it joined fellow developing countries in forums like the Non-Aligned Movement to underscore its independent stance. \n\nBy the 1970s, Singapore was a founding member of ASEAN (1967), using regional solidarity to buffer external pressures. It also established the Five Power Defence Arrangements in 1971 alongside Malaysia, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand \u2013 a multilateral pact for consultation in defense \u2013 which gave Singapore a security safety net without tying it to any superpower bloc. Notably, Singapore waited until 1990 to establish formal diplomatic relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China, doing so on its own terms once regional conditions allowed. Throughout the post-Cold War era, as China rose and the U.S. remained a Pacific power, Singapore\u2019s refrain has been that it **\u201cdoes not wish to choose sides\u201d** between Washington and Beijing\u301025\u2020L49-L57\u3011. This even-handed positioning, rooted in early principles of non-alignment, has continued to guide Singapore\u2019s actions. Indeed, Singapore\u2019s approach since the Cold War\u2019s end relies on having no intractable conflicts with either major power and on sufficient overlap in U.S.-China interests \u2013 conditions that historically gave it *room to maneuver* and engage both sides simultaneously\u301025\u2020L49-L57\u3011. Over time, Singapore\u2019s de facto neutrality has earned it a reputation as an honest broker and safe venue for dialogue. For example, the nation was selected to host milestone meetings like the 2015 summit between Chinese and Taiwanese leaders and the 2018 U.S.\u2013North Korea summit, reflecting international trust in Singapore\u2019s even-handedness\u301010\u2020L529-L537\u3011. \n\n## Economic Strategies: Diversification and Openness as Buffers  \nSingapore\u2019s economic statecraft has been a cornerstone of its neutrality. As a tiny island with no hinterland, Singapore bet its survival on being an **open trading hub engaging all major economies**. Early on, it pursued export-oriented industrialization and courted foreign investment from a wide array of countries \u2013 the U.S., Japan, Europe, and later China \u2013 ensuring no single power would dominate its economy. This *diversification* became ever more important as great power economic influence grew in Asia. Singapore today has one of the world\u2019s highest trade-to-GDP ratios (326% in 2018) and is the globe\u2019s top transshipment port\u30108\u2020L399-L407\u3011, a reflection of its strategy to trade with everyone. The government\u2019s guiding principle has been to guard a **free and open international trading environment**, both multilaterally and through varied partnerships\u30107\u2020L265-L273\u3011. Singapore actively championed the global trading system under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the WTO, while also joining regional and bilateral free trade agreements across the world.  \n\n**Trade diversification** is evident in Singapore\u2019s extensive network of trade pacts. Singapore has **27 free trade agreements** in force with partners spanning the globe \u2013 including the United States, China, India, Japan, the European Union, Britain, Australia, and more\u30107\u2020L287-L295\u3011. It was a key architect of the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks and joined the successor CPTPP, and simultaneously it is part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with China and ASEAN\u30107\u2020L287-L295\u3011. By embedding itself in *both* Western-leaning and Asian-led trade frameworks, Singapore avoids economic overreliance on any single power bloc. The same logic drives its investment policies: Singapore welcomes foreign direct investment from all sources, hosting over 37,000 international companies, including thousands of American, European, Japanese, and Chinese firms. This cosmopolitan economic base reduces vulnerability to pressure from any one country. **Openness** is institutionalized in policy \u2013 Singapore maintains an open market economy and is \u201cready to trade with any state for mutual benefit,\u201d as an official principle\u301016\u2020L219-L224\u3011. The government also continuously seeks new growth partners (for example, pursuing emerging market ties and sectors like fintech) to avoid being caught in a U.S.-China economic crossfire. \n\n\u301036\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Singapore\u2019s busy container port \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest \u2013 exemplifies its strategy of engaging in trade with all major economies. By diversifying trading partners and staying open, Singapore reduces reliance on any single country\u30107\u2020L287-L295\u3011.*\n\nAdditionally, Singapore leverages **economic diplomacy** through forums like APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) to broaden its trade relationships\u30107\u2020L273-L281\u3011. It has also used its role as a financial center and logistics hub to deepen interdependence: e.g. acting as a conduit for Chinese companies raising capital and as a regional headquarters for Western multinationals. By positioning itself as indispensable to global commerce, Singapore gains a measure of protection \u2013 major powers have a stake in its stability and neutrality because their commercial interests intersect there. This economic weight has afforded Singapore *strategic autonomy* to make principled choices (such as supporting sanctions on Russia in 2022 over Ukraine on grounds of international law, even when most ASEAN states stayed neutral), without catastrophic economic fallout. In sum, **trade and investment diversification, pro-multilateral policies, and openness** have been vital economic means for Singapore to support its neutral stance and reduce the leverage any external power might hold over it.\n\n## Military and Defense Policy: Autonomy Through Deterrence and Balanced Partnerships  \nSingapore\u2019s quest for strategic autonomy is underpinned by a robust defense strategy \u2013 often summarized as **\u201ca strong Singapore armed forces to deter aggression, without formal alignment.\u201d** From independence, Singapore\u2019s leaders understood that a credible military was *the fundamental underpinning* of an effective foreign policy\u301016\u2020L209-L217\u3011. In 1967, amidst regional uncertainty, the country introduced universal conscription (National Service) and began rapidly building the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) essentially from scratch. Assistance from various sources \u2013 notably Israel in the early years, and later technology and training from the United States and others \u2013 was quietly enlisted. The result is that Singapore now fields one of Southeast Asia\u2019s most advanced, well-equipped militaries despite its small size. This substantial **defense buildup** serves as a deterrent against threats, allowing Singapore to assert a confident foreign policy without needing to rely on another nation for protection. As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs puts it, *a credible deterrent military defence* is critical for Singapore to be taken seriously on the world stage\u301016\u2020L209-L217\u3011. In effect, military self-reliance grants Singapore the freedom to choose neutrality; it is less vulnerable to coercion or the need to seek a protector.\n\nAt the same time, Singapore has skillfully cultivated **security partnerships that stop short of alliance entanglements**. A key example is the **Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA)** of 1971. Under the FPDA, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singapore agreed to consult each other in the event of an attack on Malaysia or Singapore. This provided a form of insurance after the British military withdrawal from Singapore, but importantly it is *not* a binding alliance with automatic intervention. Singapore has consistently emphasized that the FPDA is *defensive and non-aligned*. Marking the pact\u2019s 50th anniversary, Singapore\u2019s Defence Minister noted the FPDA\u2019s \u201cposture of being non-threatening, not directed at any one country, but a regional grouping that promotes inclusiveness and cooperation\u201d\u301012\u2020L53-L61\u3011. Indeed, FPDA exercises build interoperability and signal collective commitment, yet the arrangement is explicitly **not aimed at any external power**, thus aligning with Singapore\u2019s neutral positioning\u301012\u2020L53-L61\u3011. Over decades, FPDA drills (e.g. Exercise Bersama Lima) and ministerial dialogues have contributed to regional stability and trust \u2013 what Dr. Ng Eng Hen called a \u201c*stabiliser for the region*\u201d that helps prevent misunderstandings and miscalculations\u301012\u2020L81-L89\u3011. This shows how Singapore can participate in security frameworks that enhance its autonomy and deterrence without compromising neutrality by targeting a rival.\n\nSingapore\u2019s most significant security relationship is with the United States, but again it is carefully structured to preserve autonomy. The U.S. is seen in Singapore as an \u201cindispensable\u201d power for regional balance, and Singapore has provided access for U.S. forces since the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding (after the U.S. lost its Philippine bases). Today, the U.S. Navy\u2019s logistics command in the Western Pacific is hosted in Singapore, American littoral combat ships rotate through Changi Naval Base, and advanced aircraft regularly train at Singapore\u2019s airfields. However, **Singapore pointedly remains *non-ally***: it has no mutual defense treaty with Washington. In fact, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong explicitly stated in 2022 that Singapore \u201c**is not an ally of the U.S., will not conduct military operations on behalf of the U.S., and will not seek direct military support from the U.S.**\u201d\u301014\u2020L160-L167\u3011. This underscores that while Singapore enjoys a close defense partnership (through agreements like the 2005 Strategic Framework Agreement and 2015 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement), it retains independent control of its military and foreign policy. The arrangement gives Singapore access to top-tier military technology and training (for example, Singaporean pilots train in the U.S. and Australia due to airspace constraints at home) \u2013 boosting its self-defense capability \u2013 but avoids the loss of neutrality that a formal alliance might entail. Singapore similarly engages other powers in defense cooperation to balance its ties. It conducts military exchanges with countries as diverse as China, India, Australia, France and others, seeking *interoperability and goodwill all around*. \n\n\u301040\u2020embed_image\u3011 *An RSAF F-15SG fighter in flight. Singapore\u2019s heavy investment in advanced defense capabilities \u2013 such as a modern air force \u2013 underpins its autonomy by providing credible self-defense. The country maintains close security ties with powers like the U.S. while stopping short of a formal alliance\u301014\u2020L160-L167\u3011.*\n\nIn essence, Singapore\u2019s military strategy is one of **\u201carmed neutrality.\u201d** It has developed a strong, technologically superior military as a deterrent (sometimes described as the \u201cpoison shrimp\u201d or \u201cporcupine\u201d strategy \u2013 too prickly for bigger fish to swallow). It participates in multilateral defense arrangements (FPDA, ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 meetings, etc.) and selectively allows foreign troop presence, but it does so on its own terms, without hosting any permanent foreign base or surrendering command authority. By training and networking widely, Singapore also ensures it can work with any partner if its security is threatened, rather than being tied to a single patron. This flexibility was on display when Singapore contributed assets to the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS and provided support during the Persian Gulf wars, yet also joined regional humanitarian missions and UN peacekeeping under a UN flag. The net effect is that **Singapore can deter aggression and engage globally, while still credibly asserting an independent, neutral posture**. Its defense policies support strategic autonomy by reducing dependency and by building a reputation as a responsible but non-aligned security actor.\n\n## Diplomacy and Foreign Policy: Neutrality in International Arenas  \nDiplomacy is the arena where Singapore\u2019s balancing act is most visible. The nation\u2019s foreign policy has been described as **\u201comnidirectional\u201d** \u2013 seeking friendly relations with all powers \u2013 and rooted in *principled neutrality* on contentious geopolitical issues. A fundamental objective has been to maintain a **secure and peaceful regional environment**, which Singapore pursues by vigorous diplomacy in international institutions, ASEAN, and other multilateral frameworks\u301016\u2020L215-L224\u3011. Singapore\u2019s first generation of leaders set the tone: they were staunch anti-communists at home but pragmatically neutral abroad, championing international law and the sovereign equality of states. In Rajaratnam\u2019s 1965 UN speech, he argued that world peace and a **rules-based order** are existential needs for a small country surrounded by big powers\u30103\u2020L83-L92\u3011\u30105\u2020L115-L123\u3011. This belief in a stable, law-governed international system continues to guide Singapore\u2019s diplomatic posture. The country consistently supports the UN and its principles \u2013 for instance, it abides by International Court of Justice rulings in territorial disputes and advocates collective security. Singapore even helped convene the Forum of Small States at the UN, to amplify the voice of small nations in defending norms that protect their sovereignty.\n\n**ASEAN has been the cornerstone** of Singapore\u2019s regional diplomacy. As a founding member, Singapore has used ASEAN as a platform to reinforce Southeast Asia\u2019s non-alignment. ASEAN\u2019s Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality (ZOPFAN) declaration in 1971 reflected goals that aligned with Singapore\u2019s: keeping great power rivalries out of the region. Singapore has worked to keep ASEAN **united and neutral** \u2013 for example, by fostering consensus positions that do not overtly side with any major power, whether on the South China Sea or broader Indo-Pacific strategy. Singaporean diplomats often stress \u201cASEAN centrality\u201d in regional architecture, meaning great powers engage through ASEAN-led forums (like the ASEAN Regional Forum and East Asia Summit) where all regional states have a seat at the table rather than being divided. In 2018, Singapore\u2019s turn as ASEAN Chair saw it navigating U.S.-China tensions carefully, promoting an *ASEAN Smart Cities Network* and a code of conduct talks in the South China Sea to manage disputes without forcing alignments. Singapore has also balanced its own bilateral ties within ASEAN \u2013 maintaining strong defense and economic links with neighbors Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and others \u2013 to prevent any single neighbor from becoming a proxy for larger interests against Singapore. Good relations with immediate neighbors is explicitly listed as a principle of its foreign policy\u301016\u2020L213-L221\u3011, recognizing that regional peace is the first layer of its security.\n\nOn the global stage, Singapore positions itself as a **consistent advocate of multilateralism and free trade**, rather than as \u201cneutral for neutrality\u2019s sake.\u201d As Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan has clarified, Singapore does not equate neutrality with having no views; rather, it seeks to **\u201cuphold principles\u201d** \u2013 such as sovereignty, free navigation, and international law \u2013 in a consistent way\u30106\u2020L30-L34\u3011. This principled approach allows Singapore to take issue-based stands without being seen as aligning against any country. For example, Singapore supported the international tribunal ruling on the South China Sea in 2016 (a ruling China opposed) by emphasizing respect for UNCLOS law, not opposition to China per se. Conversely, Singapore engages China constructively through initiatives like the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative and advocating China\u2019s inclusion in regional trade deals, signaling it welcomes China\u2019s peaceful development. In institutions like APEC, the World Trade Organization, and the IMF, Singapore often plays a bridge-building role between Western and developing nations, leveraging its unique East-West perspective. It has hosted high-level diplomatic events \u2013 from the historic 1993 APEC Leaders\u2019 Meeting to the 2009 APEC summit \u2013 showcasing its ability to convene diverse powers impartially. **Hosting international dialogues** is another niche: Singapore is home to the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian security summit where U.S., Chinese and other defense chiefs come for frank exchanges. The very fact that Singapore is chosen as the venue signals its standing as neutral ground. As one analysis noted, while Singapore doesn\u2019t formally enshrine neutrality, its **\u201cde facto even-handedness\u201d** has made it a popular site for high-stakes summitry and negotiations\u301010\u2020L529-L537\u3011. \n\nDiplomatically, Singapore also invests in a **network of partnerships beyond the U.S. and China**. It maintains close ties with other major powers like Japan, India, the EU states, and emerging players \u2013 hedging its bets and widening its strategic options. For instance, Singapore was the first Southeast Asian country to establish relations with Israel (in 1969, albeit quietly), and it has a longstanding friendship with Taiwan (for military training) even as it normalized ties with Beijing. It is a dialogue partner in forums such as the Non-Aligned Movement and Commonwealth, enabling it to gather support from diverse quarters on global issues. In times of tension, Singapore often calls for **inclusive dialogue**: during the U.S.-China trade war, Singapore offered itself as a mediator and urged both to find a win-win modus vivendi, emphasizing that **no country in Asia wants to be forced to choose sides**. This line, repeated by Prime Minister Lee \u2013 *\u201cIt will not be possible for Singapore to choose between the US and China, given the extensive ties we have with both\u201d* \u2013 encapsulates Singapore\u2019s diplomatic messaging in recent years\u301027\u2020L15-L19\u3011. In summary, through active engagement in regional and global institutions, a reputation for principled consistency, and skillful messaging, Singapore has diplomatically positioned itself as an **independent, credible voice** that all sides can talk to \u2013 a vital asset for neutrality.\n\n## Soft Power and Strategic Identity: The Subtler Tools  \nBeyond hard power and diplomacy, Singapore wields **soft power** to reinforce its strategic identity as a neutral, innovative, and trustworthy state. Soft power \u2013 the ability to influence and attract \u2013 has been consciously cultivated to augment Singapore\u2019s autonomy by shaping perceptions and building goodwill internationally. One major avenue is **education and thought leadership**. Singapore has become an education hub in Asia, and the government has launched numerous scholarship and training programs for foreign students and officials. The Singapore Cooperation Programme, for example, has provided technical training to over 100,000 officials from other developing countries over decades, quietly exporting Singapore\u2019s developmental model and fostering friendly ties. Likewise, leading Singaporean universities host many foreign students. The Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (part of National University of Singapore) explicitly aims \u201cto train the next generation of Asian policy-makers and leaders,\u201d with about **80% of its students coming from overseas**\u301021\u2020L69-L77\u3011\u301021\u2020L81-L87\u3011. By educating future leaders from around Asia and beyond, Singapore extends its soft influence \u2013 alumni return home with familiarity and often admiration for Singapore\u2019s governance approach. This is a deliberate strategy to \u201cexpand the reach of Singapore\u2019s soft power\u201d\u301021\u2020L81-L87\u3011. It creates a network of foreign elites who have positive ties to Singapore, enhancing the country\u2019s diplomatic capital and image as a benevolent, knowledge-sharing nation.\n\nSingapore\u2019s **media and intellectual outreach** also contribute. Regionally, channels like *Channel NewsAsia* (CNA) project Singapore\u2019s perspectives with a reputation for relatively balanced reporting, increasing Singapore\u2019s informational influence in Southeast Asia. Singapore\u2019s think tanks punch above their weight \u2013 the likes of the *S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS)*, *ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute*, and *Singapore Institute of International Affairs* frequently convene international dialogues and publish research on Asian security and policy. They attract global experts and function as neutral platforms for debate (for instance, RSIS\u2019s annual Asia Pacific Security Conference and the Sherpa meetings for the Shangri-La Dialogue). This thought leadership role reinforces Singapore\u2019s identity as a **thoughtful facilitator in international discourse**, rather than a partisan actor. Even Singapore\u2019s former diplomats and leaders contribute to its soft power by sharing candid insights on global affairs \u2013 the late Lee Kuan Yew became a sought-after sage on U.S.-China relations; former UN Ambassador Kishore Mahbubani\u2019s writings (like *\u201cCan Asians Think?\u201d*) have influenced debates on the global order. Such intellectual contributions bolster respect for Singapore\u2019s independent viewpoints.\n\nCulturally, Singapore leverages its unique diversity and modernity as part of its brand. It has carefully crafted an image as a clean, efficient, cosmopolitan city \u2013 a \u201c**global Asia**\u201d in microcosm. Symbols like the Merlion and Marina Bay Sands skyline are instantly recognizable and associated with stability and prosperity. The tourism and hospitality Singapore extends (air travel via Changi Airport, flagship events like the Formula One night race, and international conferences) all serve to draw foreigners and embed Singapore as a neutral, welcoming crossroads of East and West. This cosmopolitan soft power paid dividends when, for example, both the U.S. and North Korea trusted Singapore to host their summit \u2013 the country\u2019s reputation for strict security, orderliness, and neutrality made it an obvious choice. Singapore also uses **nation-branding** initiatives \u2013 such as the international marketing of \u201cBrand Singapore\u201d \u2013 to emphasize qualities like trustworthiness, multicultural harmony, and rule of law, which attract business and goodwill from all sides. \n\n\u301046\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Iconic image of Singapore\u2019s Merlion against the city\u2019s financial district. Singapore projects a brand of modern efficiency, safety, and neutrality that attracts businesses, talent, and even high-stakes diplomatic events, enhancing its soft power.* \n\nEducation remains the flagship of Singapore\u2019s soft power. In addition to the LKY School, Singapore\u2019s primary and secondary education system consistently tops global rankings (PISA scores), and this success is showcased to inspire other countries. Singapore hosts international students from ASEAN and beyond on government scholarships, quietly building bonds. As one Malaysian parliamentarian noted, having studied in Singapore, he developed a lasting affinity and networks that aid bilateral understanding\u301021\u2020L105-L113\u3011. Such stories repeat across Southeast Asia. Furthermore, Singapore\u2019s **technocratic governance model** \u2013 with its reputation for clean government and competence \u2013 is itself an attractive example (often dubbed the \u201cSingapore model\u201d). Developing nations often send delegations to learn from Singapore\u2019s urban planning, port management, or anti-corruption practices. This *admiration by example* gives Singapore a form of moral authority in global discussions on development issues disproportionate to its size. In total, these soft power efforts support Singapore\u2019s strategic autonomy by **bolstering its international standing** and making it in the interest of many countries to see Singapore remain secure and independent. A nation that is respected and liked is harder to isolate or bully; thus, soft power is a subtle shield for Singapore\u2019s neutrality.\n\n## Assessing the Success of Singapore\u2019s Neutrality Strategy  \nMore than half a century since independence, Singapore\u2019s track record suggests it has been **highly successful** in achieving neutrality and strategic autonomy \u2013 albeit not without occasional frictions and ongoing challenges. The primary indicators of success are Singapore\u2019s enduring sovereignty, security, and prosperity in an often volatile environment. The nation has navigated Cold War conflicts, regional confrontations, and shifting great power dynamics *without* being subsumed into any bloc or suffering major conflict. It remains one of the few countries in the world that enjoys **simultaneously strong relations with the U.S. and China**. For instance, it is a *Major Security Cooperation Partner* of the United States and hosts U.S. military rotations, while China has, in recent years, become Singapore\u2019s largest trading partner and a close economic collaborator. Singapore\u2019s ability to balance these ties is often cited as a model for other small states. Its **even-handed diplomacy** has clearly paid off: as noted, it is trusted to host events involving mutually adversarial states\u301010\u2020L529-L537\u3011, and neither Washington nor Beijing (nor any neighbor) sees Singapore as a hostile actor. This is a diplomatic sweet spot that few countries manage to occupy.\n\nEconomically, Singapore\u2019s strategy of diversification has yielded one of Asia\u2019s most resilient economies. It suffered less than some neighbors during periods of great power tension or financial crises, thanks to its diverse trade portfolio and enormous accumulated reserves (a buffer against external shocks). By being indispensable to multiple powers economically \u2013 for example, as a financial hub for Western companies and a key node in China\u2019s Belt and Road projects \u2013 Singapore has made it *costly* for any one power to punish or ostracize it. This interdependence is a bulwark of its autonomy. Singapore\u2019s high per capita GDP (over $65,000) and consistently top global competitiveness rankings testify to how operating an open, neutral economic policy has been a net boon. The alignment of its economic success with its neutrality imperative was perhaps best summarized by Prof. Ja Ian Chong, who noted that Singapore\u2019s national success \u201crelates as much to its strategic location\u2026 **avoidance of involvement in major international disputes, and efforts to work with various major powers**\u201d as it does to internal good governance\u301025\u2020L71-L79\u3011. In other words, the foreign policy of engaging all and offending none has been integral to Singapore\u2019s transformation from vulnerable port city to thriving \u201cAsian heavyweight.\u201d\n\nMilitarily, Singapore has deterred any would-be aggressors \u2013 there have been no direct attacks on Singapore since independence despite periods of regional turbulence (e.g. Konfrontasi in the 1960s, Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978, etc.). Its defense partnerships have provided backup without compromising independence. The FPDA, for example, quietly assured Singapore\u2019s security during the Cold War when threats from neighbors were higher, yet did not enmesh Singapore in superpower politics. Singapore has managed to upgrade its U.S. security ties (e.g. through the 2019 renewal of defense agreements) while *also* signing new security cooperation MOUs with China (such as a 2019 agreement on bilateral military exercises and a pledge to update defense protocols). This ability to compartmentalize and maintain trust on both sides is a diplomatic feat. However, the balancing act has not been entirely without hiccups. There have been moments of strain \u2013 for example, in 2016, after Singapore voiced support for the South China Sea arbitration ruling, Chinese state media criticized Singapore, and the Hong Kong authorities seized some Singaporean military vehicles en route from Taiwan. Singapore stood firm on principle but also engaged Beijing to smooth relations, which normalized by 2017. Similarly, Singapore\u2019s refusal to suspend military training in Taiwan (a legacy arrangement) irritates China, but Singapore has carefully managed this by also expanding defense dialogue with the PRC. On the U.S. side, Singapore occasionally faces pressure to take a clearer stance against China (especially on tech or the South China Sea), but Washington has broadly understood Singapore\u2019s position and valued its candor. Overall, Singapore has *maintained an independent line without severe penalty*, indicating a successful balance. \n\nDomestically, Singaporeans largely support the neutrality imperative, seeing it as vital for survival. This national consensus has helped keep foreign policy steady across different Prime Ministers. The consistency itself is a marker of success: unlike some small states that swing between alignments when governments change, Singapore\u2019s policy has remained stable and credible, enhancing foreign partners\u2019 confidence. Internationally, Singapore often ranks well in **soft power indices** and surveys of trust \u2013 a 2021 global soft power index ranked Singapore 20th worldwide (and rising)\u301019\u2020L13-L21\u3011, remarkable for a country of 5.5 million. This reflects the respect and appeal Singapore has garnered through its smart balancing and competence, further validating its approach.\n\nThat said, Singapore\u2019s leadership is keenly aware that *the formula which worked in the past will be tested in the future*. As Ja Ian Chong observes, Singapore\u2019s long-held stance of not choosing sides has become more **\u201crisky and costly\u201d** as U.S.-China rivalry intensifies\u301025\u2020L53-L60\u3011. The overlapping interests between the superpowers that Singapore relied on are diminishing, and pressures on third countries to align are growing. So far, Singapore has managed these pressures adeptly \u2013 speaking out when core interests are at stake, but mostly encouraging both powers to exercise restraint. Its success up to the present is evident in its continued freedom of action: Singapore can host the U.S. Vice President one week and welcome China\u2019s foreign minister the next without raising eyebrows. It also remains a *voice that both Washington and Beijing listen to* \u2013 an intangible but real measure of strategic autonomy. In summary, up to now Singapore has largely achieved its geopolitical imperative: it is **widely seen as neutral yet not naive**, autonomous yet engaged with all, and it has protected its national interests effectively through turbulent times.\n\n## Forward-Looking Analysis: Sustaining the Balance Amid Rising U.S.-China Tensions  \nGoing forward, Singapore faces an increasingly delicate task to maintain its neutrality and strategic autonomy. The **U.S.-China rivalry is escalating** across trade, technology, and security domains, and the Asia-Pacific region is a primary theater of their competition. For Singapore, this raises the stakes: the margin for \u201cnot choosing sides\u201d is narrowing as both great powers vie for influence and may demand clearer positions. Regional dynamics are also evolving, with ASEAN cohesion under strain and external powers pushing their agendas. In this environment, Singapore will need to *adapt and reinforce* its strategies on multiple fronts:\n\n**1. Double-Down on Diversification:** Singapore must further diversify its economic and strategic partnerships to avoid overdependence on either the U.S. or China. This means deepening ties with other growth centers \u2013 such as the EU, UK, Japan, India, South Korea, and emerging markets. Singapore is already pursuing this (for example, negotiating new digital economy agreements with partners like the UK, and investing in India\u2019s infrastructure). Strengthening these links will provide alternative channels for trade and technology if U.S.-China decoupling intensifies. Singapore can also leverage new multilateral pacts like the CPTPP (which it helped bring into force) and potentially benefit if the U.S. rejoins or if others like the UK (already set to join) and Korea join. At the same time, Singapore should maintain its active role in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative in a way that boosts regional connectivity but avoids exclusive dependence \u2013 focusing on win-win projects like the Singapore-Chongqing logistics corridor or green finance collaborations. By keeping its economic ecosystem as *interconnected and globalized as possible*, Singapore reduces the risk of being caught in a zero-sum economic squeeze by either superpower.\n\n**2. Uphold a Principled Foreign Policy (Not Equidistance for its Own Sake):** As Foreign Minister Balakrishnan indicated, Singapore will continue to **\u201cnot take sides, but uphold principles\u201d**\u30106\u2020L30-L34\u3011. In practice, this means in any dispute \u2013 be it the South China Sea, trade rules, or new issues like digital governance \u2013 Singapore should articulate its stance based on consistent principles (international law, free navigation, peaceful settlement of disputes, etc.). By doing so, it can justify its positions without being seen as kowtowing to one side. This principled approach will be crucial if, for instance, tensions flare over Taiwan or the South China Sea \u2013 Singapore might reiterate support for the One China policy and peaceful dialogue (addressing China\u2019s concern) while also defending the right of smaller states to not be bullied (addressing the U.S./international concern). In global forums, Singapore can work with middle powers to champion the multilateral system itself \u2013 advocating that both the U.S. and China respect institutions like the WTO and UNCLOS. If great power trust erodes, Singapore may need to invest more in **minilateral groupings of the like-minded** (for example, small advanced economies or ASEAN+ partners) to collectively push back against pressure to align. The recently formed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which Singapore joined, is one example of engaging a U.S. initiative without it being military in nature, thus maintaining balance. Singapore could encourage the idea (floated by some ASEAN thinkers) of a **\u201cneutrality agreement\u201d** in Southeast Asia \u2013 essentially urging the big powers to formally acknowledge ASEAN\u2019s neutral zone status\u301015\u2020L5-L13\u3011. While getting the U.S. and China to \u201cguarantee\u201d ASEAN neutrality may be ambitious, Singapore can rally ASEAN to insist on not becoming proxies in any new Cold War.\n\n**3. Strengthen ASEAN Unity and Regional Architecture:** Internally, Singapore will continue working to keep ASEAN from fragmenting under external pressures. A divided ASEAN would force Singapore into tighter choices, whereas a unified ASEAN can collectively say no to taking sides. Singapore should support ASEAN partners through capacity-building and diplomacy to ensure the group remains relevant. Pushing forward initiatives like the **ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP)** \u2013 which emphasizes inclusivity and cooperative approaches \u2013 can provide an ASEAN-centric buffer against polarising concepts. Additionally, Singapore could champion enhancements to regional forums: for instance, elevating the East Asia Summit\u2019s role in preventive diplomacy, or institutionalizing a code of conduct in the South China Sea to reduce flashpoints. By keeping itself at the heart of ASEAN-led processes, Singapore amplifies its neutral voice. It may also look to new forms of regional cooperation in emerging domains (cyber security, pandemic response, climate action) that bring the U.S. and China to the same table under neutral auspices. Such efforts serve the dual purpose of mitigating U.S.-China rivalry impact and reinforcing Singapore\u2019s standing as an *indispensable regional coordinator*.\n\n**4. Continue Investing in Defense Self-Reliance and Smart Security Partnerships:** Militarily, Singapore will likely further modernize its forces \u2013 for example, introducing next-generation systems (it is already acquiring F-35 fighters and developing cyber defenses) \u2013 to ensure it can deter threats independently in a more uncertain future. A credible SAF remains the bedrock of autonomy. Concurrently, Singapore will maintain and carefully calibrate its key security partnerships. With the U.S., it can deepen cooperation in areas that enhance its capabilities (like intelligence sharing, counter-terrorism, and joint training) without crossing into alliance obligations. The renewal of the U.S.-Singapore defense pact through 2035 is a signal that Singapore will support a continuing U.S. presence in Asia as a stabilizing force \u2013 but likely quietly, without fanfare, to avoid provoking China. With China, Singapore can expand confidence-building measures: more frequent high-level military dialogues, port calls, and even selective bilateral exercises (as have started in recent years) to signal that engagement is not zero-sum. Singapore might also leverage the FPDA\u2019s inclusive nature, as Dr. Ng suggested, to invite observation or cooperation from other countries (perhaps China or the U.S. in humanitarian exercises) to show it\u2019s not a closed bloc\u301012\u2020L81-L89\u3011. Essentially, Singapore will try to **demonstrate that its defense ties with one are not directed against the other**, maintaining transparency and communication to prevent misperceptions. Also, new *\u201cTotal Defence\u201d* domains \u2013 such as countering foreign interference (through cyber or information warfare) \u2013 will be critical. Singapore has already passed laws to guard against hostile information campaigns, which will help it resist any covert efforts by bigger powers to sway its domestic opinion or politics. Preserving national unity and resilience against external influence will be fundamental in allowing the government to stick to its chosen foreign policy course.\n\n**5. Leverage Soft Power as a Strategic Asset:** In an era of rivalry, Singapore\u2019s soft power can be a valuable stabilizer. The country can ramp up its role as a **neutral convener** \u2013 perhaps offering to host or mediate dialogues on contentious issues (like it did for the Trump-Kim summit). For example, should U.S.-China communication channels break down, Singapore could propose informal retreats or track-2 dialogues on its soil to keep lines open. Its think tanks and universities can facilitate understanding by bringing American and Chinese scholars and officials together, keeping Singapore at the center of problem-solving efforts. Moreover, Singapore can project itself as a champion of global issues that transcend the U.S.-China binary, such as climate change, sustainable development, and global health. By being a vocal advocate and innovator in these areas (Singapore is investing heavily in climate resilience and positioning as a green finance hub), it carves an international role that is cooperative rather than competitive, indirectly easing great power frictions. Culturally, continuing to welcome global talent and visitors (while maintaining social harmony at home) will sustain Singapore\u2019s image as an open global city, not a partisan camp. The more Singapore is seen as *everyone\u2019s gateway in Asia*, the more all powers have a stake in its neutrality. Education diplomacy will remain key \u2013 expanding scholarships and leadership programs for youths from around the region, for instance, to cultivate the next generation of pro-Singapore sentiment. In short, doubling down on soft power can help Singapore **\u201cpunch above its weight\u201d** and navigate the intangibles of superpower relations.\n\nIn executing these forward strategies, Singapore\u2019s leaders will also need to stay *nimble and pragmatic*. They have historically been adept at sensing shifts in geopolitical winds and adjusting course while holding core principles constant. As the U.S.-China gulf deepens, Singapore might at times take on a candid advisory role \u2013 using its access to both sides to urge restraint. For example, Prime Minister Lee has in the past written in **Foreign Affairs** calling on the U.S. and China to compromise for the sake of Asia\u2019s future. We can expect Singapore to continue such thought leadership, cautioning against a bifurcated world and making the case that forcing countries to choose sides will harm all. This narrative, coming from a respected neutral party, can have an impact on international discourse. Domestically, Singapore will also prepare its population for a less benign environment \u2013 emphasizing unity, adaptability, and the importance of staying true to its independent foreign policy. \n\nIn conclusion, Singapore\u2019s challenge in the coming years is to **sustain the delicate equilibrium** it has maintained for decades. The strategic imperative of neutrality and autonomy remains unchanged \u2013 if anything, it is even more crucial now. The methods to uphold it will require constant recalibration as global power dynamics shift. Singapore\u2019s past success provides confidence that it can manage this balance: it has navigated similar perilous straits before. By remaining **principled, pragmatic, and proactive**, Singapore can continue to chart its own course \u2013 one where it doesn\u2019t have to choose between giants, and instead chooses what best secures the interests of its citizenry and the stability of its region.\n\n## Sources\n\n- Rajaratnam, S.
