I'll focus on key functionalities, installation, usage, and limitations, and check if it can help with sorting Gmail messages by sender/subject/genre. I'll also investigate its vulnerabilities, checking for any updates since my knowledge cutoff.\n\n**Digging deeper into clawdbot's functionality and setup**\n\nWe have some search results, but I need to dig deeper, specifically by opening the README and documentation for key features like installation, Gmail integration, and security. I'll look into things like core architecture\u2014agents, channels, and control planes\u2014and how to install it on different platforms like macOS, Linux, and Windows. We\u2019ll also inspect how it interacts with AI models.\n\n**Evaluating typical tasks and Gmail integration**\n\nI\u2019ll check the typical tasks for clawdbot, like inbox cleanup, calendar management, travel check-in, and others, as well as ephemeral tasks like proactive messages. For Gmail, I\u2019m looking into its integration through Google OAuth and the Gmail API, possibly within a \"skills\" directory. I'll dive into the docs to clarify.\n\n**Confirming Gmail integration and evaluating sorting capabilities**\n\nIt looks like Clawdbot can work with Gmail through the `gog` CLI or built-in Gmail skills, even integrating with push notifications or search. It\u2019s likely able to clear inboxes, send emails, and manage calendars. I need to dig deeper into its functionalities to confirm if it excels at sorting messages based on specific criteria.\n\n**Creating a report with security analysis and known issues**\n\nI'll include bullet points and possibly code blocks for commands in the report. I\u2019ll cover security aspects like the local agent's access to the machine, chat app integrations, the risk of remote command execution, and issues with storing credentials or OAuth tokens. Also, I\u2019ll mention that it\u2019s still in early stages (Jan 2026) with open issues, including vulnerabilities. I'll check issue #1796 for more details.\n\n**Investigating specific issue details**\n\nThe issue content was cut off because of the word limit. To get more specific information, I\u2019ll use web open with line numbers to locate the critical parts. I'll also search for keywords like \"CRITICAL\" or \"hardcoded\" to make sure I get the relevant details from the issue.\n\n**Reviewing critical issues and security report**\n\nThe find result for \"CRITICAL\" gives us part of the issue body, already listing critical concerns. We should address vulnerabilities, like unencrypted tokens and OAuth issues. Since this is an AI-generated report, I'll note it's automated and may not be validated. I\u2019ll check docs on sandboxing and security policies.\n\n**Reviewing setup complexities and risks**\n\nThe security docs look solid, but we also need to address limitations: WhatsApp's complexity, like QR pairing and possible two-phone setup, requires Node.js 22+, and needs a stable host. It's open-source and might be buggy, with potential risks like account bans. I\u2019ll search for disclaimers in the WhatsApp docs.\n\n**Assessing Gmail sorting and classification**\n\nTo meet the user's request of sorting through large volumes of Gmail messages, we can use the Gmail API via the \"gog\" CLI or run a skill for searching and classifying messages. However, performance could be impacted by rate limits and the cost of using LLMs for large scans. I'll check the 'gog' docs to confirm details.\n\n**Reviewing `gogcli` documentation for report**\n\nI found the `gogcli` repo by steipete, which Clawdbot uses for Gmail access and pubsub. I need to gather enough information from the official docs and GitHub to describe key functionalities, typical tasks, and Gmail sorting capabilities. Let's open the full README to dig deeper.\n\n**Opening GitHub README URL carefully**\n\nThe tool restricts opening URLs unless they\u2019re from previous search results or a user message. To open the raw GitHub URL, I should first search for it or click a \"raw\" link within the GitHub page. I\u2019ll search for the URL to enable opening it properly.\n\n**Opening GitHub repo page snippet**\n\nThe search didn\u2019t return the raw URLs, but the GitHub repository root page might still have accessible README content. It includes a snippet mentioning \"From source (development).\" We can explore the repo page to get useful content. I\u2019ll open the website and check specific lines for further details.\n\n**Opening Clawdbot website for additional info**\n\nNow we have the repo page content and README, which is helpful for the report. Next, I need to open the Clawdbot website (separate from the repo). Since the user provided the URL in their message, I can open it directly. I'll use the link they shared to access it.\n\n**Looking for \"Install\" instructions on Clawdbot homepage**\n\nI opened the Clawdbot homepage, but it seems to contain quotes and not the technical details I need. There might be specific sections like \"Install\" further down the page. I\u2019ll use the search function to locate any install instructions or related technical info on the homepage.\n\n**Focusing on documentation for Clawdbot functionalities**\n\nThe homepage doesn't seem to have installation instructions\u2014only quotes. We\u2019ll need to dig into the documentation and GitHub README for more info. I want to analyze the code structure, look at key docs like \"Getting Started\" and explore specific areas like setup, Gmail integration, and typical tasks.\n\n**Clarifying product name and analyzing Clawdbot capabilities**\n\nIt seems the product is called \"Clawdbot,\" but the assistant itself might just be named \"Clawd,\" so let's stick with calling it \"Clawdbot\" for consistency. I'll summarize its main functionalities: multi-channel communication, agent runtime with LLM integration, and various tools for actions like device control, cron jobs, and Gmail Pub/Sub.\n\n**Adding more features of Clawdbot**\n\nClawdbot also offers a \"Control UI\" web interface, a CLI, and a macOS menu bar app. It has persistent memory with session logs and supports automation like cron jobs, heartbeats, and Gmail Pub/Sub. Several security features include DM pairing, sandboxing in Docker, and remote access via Tailscale or SSH.\n\n**Potential limitations of Clawdbot**\n\nSetting up Clawdbot can be complex, requiring Node >=22 and continuous gateway operation. WhatsApp integration risks account bans. Some integrations need external binaries and are OS-specific. Running large models demands significant hardware. Gmail integration via the API is complex and may be slow. Security vulnerabilities may exist, but could be addressed.\n\n**Verifying Clawdbot credential storage and vulnerabilities**\n\nThere\u2019s an issue from January 2026 we need to verify for fixes. It mentions tokens stored in plaintext but with specific permissions, which could still be unencrypted. We should check the docs and code, particularly credential storage like in `device-auth-store.ts`. Also, consider risks like prompt injection, unauthorized tool use, and potential issues with plugins or webhooks.\n\n**Examining SECURITY.md for vulnerabilities**\n\nThe search didn\u2019t turn up the specific file paths, but I think we can still address vulnerabilities using the security issue as a reference. I\u2019ll check the SECURITY.md file for official policy, and I'll try opening it directly from the repository using the file list there. I'll click on the link.\n\n**Accessing SECURITY.md file for details**\n\nIt looks like I\u2019m still running into access restrictions on the SECURITY.md page, possibly due to GitHub's anti-bot measures. While I can\u2019t view the file directly, I might try manually opening it from the repository and using a workaround to view lines with content. It seems the login might be required.\n\n**Trying different approaches to access file**\n\nIt could be a GitHub glitch, so I\u2019ll try adding `?plain=1` and `raw=1` to the URL for the SECURITY.md page. This might help access the content in a more open format. I'll search for URLs with \"SECURITY.md plain=1\" to create a safer link.\n\n**Discussing Clawdbot setup and security**\n\nI've gathered documentation for Clawdbot's security and GitHub page and will cite them regarding vulnerabilities. Although I still can't open the raw file, I can rely on the available docs. The repository is actively developed with stable/beta/dev channels. The easiest way to install is via `npm install -g clawdbot@latest`. I'll mention details like Node >=22 and the `clawdbot gateway`.\n\n**Summarizing Clawdbot features and security**\n\nClawdbot has key features like multi-channel, multi-agent support, voice, canvas, and more. I'll cite the README and docs, including the `clawdbot security audit` command. Docs highlight security limitations, such as treating inbound DMs as untrusted and prompting warnings about local models and potential exec tool misuse. I'll cite relevant resources.\n\n**Mentioning remote access and Gmail sorting tools**\n\nClawdbot can use Tailscale for remote access with token/password authentication. If a token is stolen, device tokens can be rotated for protection. I should cite the README and Tailscale documentation. Also, exploring Gmail sorting: I'll mention the `gog` CLI tool for searching Gmail and Gmail pubsub for message delivery. I'll check the relevant docs for details on `gog.gmail.search`.\n\n**Planning to minimize tool calls and focus on essentials**\n\nWe\u2019re close to maxing out tool calls and have only two left. It's crucial to be selective. We've already gathered many sources and citations, so additional calls should be limited. I might need to open more lines in Gmail pubsub docs, but I\u2019ll rely on the snippet for now for required details.\n\n**Gathering relevant details for a detailed investigation**\n\nI\u2019m thinking we should include information about Gmail Pub/Sub for email events pushed to Clawdbot and Tailscale. We\u2019ve already got a useful snippet for the installer/wizard docs. For security, I\u2019ll mention the sandbox vs tool policy, and the limitations of the system. Detailed investigation needs citations from existing sources, and I\u2019ll cite relevant docs for Gmail search, the gog tool, and the external repo.\n\n**Detailed breakdown for Clawdbot response**\n\nI feel it\u2019s important to mention Clawdbot\u2019s open-source nature, its local-first approach, and key functionalities like multi-channel messaging, automation, and persistent memory. I\u2019ll highlight the necessary installation steps (Node \u226522), use of npm, and CLI commands. Also, security should be covered, citing the security audits and baseline configuration documentation.\n\n**Overview of Clawdbot tasks and Gmail sorting**\n\nClawdbot excels at handling tasks like messaging, automation, writing code, and triaging emails. For Gmail, it uses the `gog` skill and Gmail Pub/Sub for efficient search and filtering. For large volumes, a two-stage approach (search query + LLM classification) is suggested to streamline the process.\n\n**Privacy considerations and security recommendations for Clawdbot**\n\nClawdbot relies on third-party APIs and has some vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection and token storage risks. To mitigate this, use security practices like limited access, sandboxing, running under least privilege, and restricting resources. Citations from the documentation and security reports will support these points.\n\n**Structure of report for Clawdbot**\n\nThe report should have an executive summary briefly explaining Clawdbot, along with key functionalities like multi-channel chatting, automation, and security. It will cover installation, typical tasks, Gmail sorting, limitations, known vulnerabilities, and a mitigation checklist. I should define technical terms and avoid downloading files or casual language. The report can also mention relevant UI/navigation development and news for context.\n\n**Navigating UI elements and resources for Clawdbot report**\n\nThere seems to be confusion about whether news sources are required. My understanding is that `navlist` needs reference IDs from news sources, but we aren\u2019t using a \"news\" command in our tool set. UI elements like an image might be useful, but I don't think they\u2019re necessary for this report. I\u2019ll avoid them.\n\n**Preparing citations for Clawdbot report**\n\nConsidering the developer\u2019s suggestion to use images isn\u2019t necessary here, I'll adhere to the more efficient path without adding images. Instead, I\u2019ll focus on crafting an answer with multiple citations, around five or more, sourced from various relevant documentation, including GitHub, security docs, and others. Each citation will support key points in the report.\n\n**Crafting a comprehensive Clawdbot report**\n\nI need to focus on presenting a clear but thorough analysis. I\u2019ll cite important details such as technical specifications and security concerns, but I\u2019ll also make sure to highlight nuances\u2014like the perspective around hardcoded OAuth client secrets. I\u2019ll include installation steps and important commands, being cautious about where I get information from.\n\n**Clarifying Clawdbot setup and tasks**\n\nI need to detail the Clawdbot setup, like cloning and config file locations. I\u2019ll mention usage examples from the docs and the built-in features like exec, apply_patch, and browser tool. For Gmail classification, I\u2019ll describe using Gog CLI and propose a sample pipeline, but clarify it\u2019s just an example.\n\n**Clarifying Clawdbot Gmail tasks and limitations**\n\nClawdbot\u2019s Gmail integration can query messages, search, and possibly label, though direct email sending may depend on the tools available, specifically via `gog CLI`. However, sending and other tasks aren't fully verified. Clawdbot\u2019s local-first model still uses remote LLMs, exposing privacy risks. Email tasks also require endpoints exposed securely. We must mention the potential vulnerabilities, like misconfigurations. Also, Clawdbot\u2019s architecture involves a \"Pi agent runtime\" that interacts with tools via RPC.\n\n**Explaining Clawdbot\u2019s Gmail functionality and tasks**\n\nClawdbot integrates with Gmail, enabling features like search using the `gog` tool, and possibly labels or email actions. For tasks like sorting through thousands of emails, it uses search queries to narrow results, then may apply AI classification. However, privacy concerns arise since data might be sent to remote models."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 18m 57s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-centralindia-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-21c110af-463e-4acb-8a49-02a96073b884:IN","parent_id":"9d5df924-69e6-4422-b958-35e140e21e74","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_697744f607148191844796fbe6542286","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"697744f6-0b98-8324-8e35-34f47d1ec5a8","async_task_created_at":"2026-01-26T10:41:59.128620Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"9d5df924-69e6-4422-b958-35e140e21e74","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"21c110af-463e-4acb-8a49-02a96073b884","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"2165b36d-7653-4212-98d0-00f54053224d","finished_duration_sec":1137,"pro_skipped":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9d5df924-69e6-4422-b958-35e140e21e74","children":["c3b23c94-a93d-4460-9c39-87ffc964a75c"]},"c3b23c94-a93d-4460-9c39-87ffc964a75c":{"id":"c3b23c94-a93d-4460-9c39-87ffc964a75c","message":{"id":"c3b23c94-a93d-4460-9c39-87ffc964a75c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1769425256.873811,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["## What Clawdbot is (and what it isn\u2019t)\n\n**Clawdbot is a self\u2011hosted personal AI assistant stack** that you run on your own machine(s).

The docs emphasize these are **typed tools** (not \u201cshell out to random scripts\u201d by default) and can replace older \u201cskill-only\u201d approaches. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view3\ue201\n\nYou can:\n- globally **allow/deny tools** (`tools.allow` / `tools.deny`) \ue200cite\ue202turn16view3\ue201  \n- set **tool profiles** (e.g., \u201cmessaging-only\u201d or \u201ccoding\u201d) to shrink blast radius \ue200cite\ue202turn16view3\ue201  \n- restrict tools per model provider (`tools.byProvider`) so weaker/less reliable models get fewer privileges \ue200cite\ue202turn16view3\ue201  \n\nThis matters for safety: the difference between a bot that can only summarize messages vs one that can execute code and manipulate files is enormous.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Skills + plugins ecosystem (and \u201cClawdHub\u201d)\nClawdbot supports a **skills** system compatible with the AgentSkills format: each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` describing how the agent should use tools for a domain. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view2\ue201\n\nSkills load from three locations with a precedence order:\n1) bundled skills (shipped with install)  \n2) managed/local (`~/.clawdbot/skills`)  \n3) per\u2011workspace (`<workspace>/skills`)  \nWorkspace wins on conflicts. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view2\ue201\n\nIt also has **ClawdHub**, described as a public skills registry, with CLI flows like installing or updating skills. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view2\ue202turn15search1\ue201\n\nPlugins can ship tools and skills, and run in\u2011process with the Gateway. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue202turn16view2\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 5) Automation hooks: cron, webhooks, Gmail Pub/Sub\nClawdbot supports automation primitives like **cron jobs** and **webhooks** (its docs group these under \u201cAutomation & Hooks\u201d). \ue200cite\ue202turn14view1\ue202turn18view0\ue201\n\nA concrete, documented automation is **Gmail Pub/Sub \u2192 Clawdbot**, described as:\n> \u201cGmail watch -> Pub/Sub push -> `gog gmail watch serve` -> Clawdbot webhook.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn18view0\ue201\n\nThis is important because it shows Clawdbot isn\u2019t only reactive; it can be event\u2011driven (new email arrives \u2192 summarize \u2192 send to chat \u2192 trigger follow\u2011up actions).\n\n---\n\n### 6) Local vs cloud model support (including local models via Ollama)\nClawdbot supports multiple model providers and can integrate with **Ollama** (local model runtime) via an OpenAI\u2011compatible application programming interface (API). \ue200cite\ue202turn12search0\ue202turn12search3\ue201\n\nHowever, the docs are blunt that \u201clocal is doable,\u201d but Clawdbot expects **large context windows and strong defenses against prompt injection**, and small/over\u2011quantized local models raise risk. It even gives a \u201cuse beefy hardware\u201d warning. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search1\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Installation and usage\n\n### System requirements\n- **Node \u2265 22** (Node.js is the JavaScript runtime used by Clawdbot) \ue200cite\ue202turn16view0\ue202turn16view1\ue201  \n- macOS / Linux / **Windows via WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2; \u201cstrongly recommended,\u201d native Windows is described as untested and more problematic) \ue200cite\ue202turn16view1\ue201  \n\n### Install options (official)\n1) **Installer script (recommended)**  \n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash\n```\nWindows PowerShell:\n```powershell\niwr -useb https://clawd.bot/install.ps1 | iex\n```\nThen:\n```bash\nclawdbot onboard --install-daemon\n```\n\ue200cite\ue202turn16view0\ue202turn16view1\ue201\n\n2) **Manual global install**  \n```bash\nnpm install -g clawdbot@latest\n# or\npnpm add -g clawdbot@latest\n```\nThen:\n```bash\nclawdbot onboard --install-daemon\n```\n\ue200cite\ue202turn16view0\ue202turn14view1\ue201\n\n3) **From source (dev/contributors)** (uses pnpm; pnpm = performant Node package manager)\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot.git\ncd clawdbot\npnpm install\npnpm ui:build\npnpm build\nclawdbot onboard --install-daemon\n```\n\ue200cite\ue202turn16view0\ue202turn14view1\ue201\n\n4) Other options: Docker, Nix, Ansible, Bun (CLI-only) are explicitly listed in install docs. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view0\ue201\n\n### First run / onboarding flow (how you actually get it working)\nThe docs recommend using the onboarding wizard:\n```bash\nclawdbot onboard --install-daemon\n```\nIt configures model authentication (often OpenAI / Anthropic, via OAuth or API keys), gateway settings, channels, pairing defaults, workspace + skills, and optionally installs a background service. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view1\ue202turn14view1\ue201\n\nStart the gateway (foreground example):\n```bash\nclawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose\n```\nand verify:\n```bash\nclawdbot status\nclawdbot health\n```\n\ue200cite\ue202turn16view1\ue202turn14view1\ue201\n\nConnect a first chat surface:\n- WhatsApp QR login:\n```bash\nclawdbot channels login\n```\n\ue200cite\ue202turn16view1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Typical tasks it should excel at\n\nBased on the project\u2019s tool surface + official \u201cShowcase\u201d examples, Clawdbot is strongest when the task is **(a) ongoing, (b) multi-step, (c) benefits from being embedded in your real communication channels**, and (d) can be bounded by tool policies.\n\nHere are realistic \u201csweet spots\u201d:\n\n### A) Inbox + notification workflows (especially event-driven)\nThe docs explicitly support Gmail event pipelines (watch \u2192 Pub/Sub \u2192 webhook \u2192 agent) and show you can deliver summaries to a chat surface with a hook mapping. \ue200cite\ue202turn18view0\ue201  \nThe showcase includes \u201cAccounting Intake\u201d that \u201ccollects PDFs from email\u201d and preps documents. \ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201\n\n### B) Browser automation where no API exists\nShowcase examples include \u201cTesco Shop Autopilot\u201d (shopping/booking via browser control) and \u201cTradingView Analysis\u201d (log in, screenshot, analyze). \ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue202turn14view1\ue201\n\n### C) Dev/workflow automation (PR review, issue triage, \u201cdo it from chat\u201d)\nShowcase examples: \u201cPR Review \u2192 Telegram Feedback,\u201d Slack auto-support, and other agent-driven dev tasks. \ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue202turn14view1\ue201\n\n### D) \u201cPersonal operating system\u201d style routines\nMulti-channel presence + cron + reminders + memory/workspaces are exactly the shape of recurring personal workflows (daily briefings, checklists, structured journaling, etc.). The system is built to be \u201calways-on\u201d via daemon install and to keep session logs for continuity. \ue200cite\ue202turn14view1\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Can it help you sort thousands of Gmail messages?\n\n### What Clawdbot has for Gmail specifically\nThere are two distinct layers:\n\n#### 1) **Searching and manipulating Gmail at scale (via gogcli)**\nClawdbot\u2019s Gmail automation docs are built around **gogcli** (\u201cgog\u201d), a script-friendly Google Suite CLI. Its README states Gmail capabilities include:\n- searching threads and messages  \n- sending emails  \n- viewing attachments  \n- managing labels/drafts/filters/delegation/vacation settings  \n- history  \n- watch (Pub/Sub push) \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue202turn18view0\ue201\n\nIt supports **JSON-first output** (`--json`) which is important for automation over thousands of items. \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201\n\nIt also documents an explicit Gmail search usage:\n```bash\ngog gmail search 'newer_than:7d'\n```\nand shows account selection patterns. \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201\n\n**So: identifying emails from a particular sender or subject is exactly what Gmail search is for**, and gogcli exposes it programmatically.\n\nExamples (sender / subject / keyword):\n```bash\n# Sender\ngog gmail search 'from:[email\u00a0protected]' --json\n\n# Subject contains\ngog gmail search 'subject:(tuition OR tutoring)' --json\n\n# Broad \u201cgenre\u201d keyword sweep (you\u2019d tune this)\ngog gmail search '(rent OR rental OR lease) newer_than:2y' --json\n```\nThose queries use Gmail\u2019s own search grammar; gogcli passes them through. \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201\n\n#### 2) **Automation + summarization pipeline (via Gmail Pub/Sub hook)**\nIf you want *ongoing* triage (new emails), Clawdbot documents a Gmail \u201cwatch\u201d pipeline and a ready-made wizard command:\n```bash\nclawdbot webhooks gmail setup --account you@gmail.com\n```\nand then running the daemon:\n```bash\nclawdbot webhooks gmail run\n```\nThe hook mapping example shows delivering message fields (from/subject/snippet/body) into an agent run and optionally delivering the summary to \u201clast\u201d channel (or a specified channel/to). \ue200cite\ue202turn18view0\ue201\n\n### What about \u201cgenre classification\u201d like rental opportunities vs employment vs tuition?\nYes, *but with an important caveat*: Clawdbot doesn\u2019t magically know your taxonomy. What it provides is:\n\n- a way to **fetch** (search) messages in bulk via Gmail API (through gogcli), and  \n- a way to **run an LLM (large language model)** over the subject/snippet/body to classify them, and  \n- a way to **act** (e.g., apply labels, forward, summarize to chat) once classified.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of job Clawdbot can do well if you set it up as a pipeline (search \u2192 classify \u2192 label/notify), but you should expect to:\n- iterate on your category definitions  \n- audit results (especially initially)  \n- respect Gmail API rate limits and model context limits  \n\n### Practical answer to your question\n- **From a particular sender?** Yes\u2014straightforward with `gog gmail search 'from:...'`. \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201  \n- **Specific subject / keywords?** Yes\u2014same mechanism (`subject:` and normal query syntax). \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201  \n- **General \u201cgenre\u201d buckets?** Yes, but it\u2019s inherently probabilistic: you\u2019d likely combine broad search filters + LLM classification + labeling. Clawdbot can orchestrate this, but you should treat it as a workflow you build and validate, not a guaranteed-perfect feature. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view3\ue202turn17view0\ue202turn18view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Limitations (what can bite you)\n\n### 1) Setup complexity is real\nEven the \u201crecommended\u201d path assumes comfort with:\n- Node.js tooling\n- running a local daemon (launchd/systemd)\n- configuring tokens for chat providers\n- for Gmail automation: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Pub/Sub topics, `gcloud`, and `tailscale` (for the supported public HTTPS endpoint path) \ue200cite\ue202turn16view1\ue202turn18view0\ue201\n\n### 2) Windows support is effectively \u201cWSL2-first\u201d\nThe docs explicitly recommend WSL2 and say native Windows is untested with poorer tool compatibility. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view1\ue201\n\n### 3) Local models are not \u201cfree lunch\u201d\nClawdbot supports local models (via Ollama), but warns you need large context and strong defenses; small models increase prompt injection risk and may truncate context. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search1\ue202turn12search0\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\n### 4) Tooling makes it powerful\u2014and therefore dangerous\nIf you enable tools like shell execution or browser control, then model mistakes become real actions. Clawdbot\u2019s own security doc basically says \u201ctreat this as risky\u201d and design access control first. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue202turn16view3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Potential vulnerabilities and security risks (the blunt version)\n\nClawdbot\u2019s docs are unusually candid: you\u2019re wiring frontier-model behavior into real messaging surfaces and real tools, and there is no perfectly secure setup. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\nHere are the main risk classes:\n\n### 1) Prompt injection (high-likelihood in the real world)\n**Prompt injection** = malicious or manipulative instructions embedded in untrusted content (messages, emails, web pages) that tries to trick the model into taking unsafe actions.\n\nClawdbot\u2019s security guide treats inbound messages as untrusted and explicitly discusses prompt injection and why it matters. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\n**What makes it worse:** giving the agent powerful tools (exec/filesystem/browser) and letting untrusted people talk to it.\n\n**Mitigation (supported in the platform):**\n- default DM pairing (unknown senders don\u2019t get processed) \ue200cite\ue202turn14view1\ue202turn11view1\ue201  \n- tool allow/deny and tool profiles (e.g., \u201cmessaging-only\u201d) \ue200cite\ue202turn16view3\ue201  \n- sandboxing + per-agent access profiles (mentioned throughout docs; see multi-agent + sandboxing notes) \ue200cite\ue202turn15search7\ue202turn16view1\ue201  \n\n### 2) Network exposure of the Gateway / Control UI\nIf you expose the Gateway or Control UI beyond localhost without proper authentication and proxy configuration, you\u2019re creating a remote control plane for an agent.\n\nThe security doc calls out reverse proxy concerns (trusted proxies, spoofing headers) and warns about insecure auth settings on the Control UI. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\n### 3) Browser control as a remote-admin surface\nBrowser automation can log into accounts, click buttons, fill forms. If an attacker gets the bot to misuse the browser tool, that\u2019s essentially \u201chands on keyboard\u201d on your behalf.\n\nThe security checklist explicitly prioritizes browser-control exposure as high risk and says treat it like a remote admin API (token required; HTTPS/tailnet-only). \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\n### 4) Plugin supply-chain risk\nPlugins run **in-process** with the Gateway. Installing plugins from npm can execute code during installation (npm lifecycle scripts), and the docs explicitly warn to treat this like running untrusted code. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\n### 5) Secrets and transcripts on disk\nClawdbot stores session transcripts on disk under `~/.clawdbot/agents/<agentId>/sessions/*.jsonl` and warns that filesystem access is a trust boundary. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201  \nIf your machine/account is compromised, those logs (and possibly credentials/config) can leak.\n\n### 6) Remote code execution via paired nodes\nIf you pair a macOS node, the Gateway can invoke `system.run` on that node; the docs describe this as remote code execution on the Mac and tell you to disable it if you don\u2019t want that risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\n### 7) Security advisories status\nGitHub\u2019s security overview for the repo indicates there aren\u2019t any published security advisories in that section at the time captured. That doesn\u2019t mean \u201cno vulnerabilities,\u201d just \u201cno advisories filed/published there.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201\n\n### Built-in hardening help: `clawdbot security audit`\nClawdbot ships a `clawdbot security audit` command (with `--deep` and `--fix`) that checks common misconfigurations like open DM/group policies + tools, gateway exposure, browser control exposure, file permissions, etc., and can apply \u201csafe guardrails\u201d (tighten open group policies, turn redaction back on, tighten permissions). \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## If your goal is Gmail triage: how I\u2019d use Clawdbot safely\n\nIf you want to process thousands of emails, you can get most of the value while reducing risk:\n\n1) **Use Gmail search to reduce the candidate set** (sender/subject/keywords). Don\u2019t feed your entire inbox to a model. \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201  \n2) **Run in \u201cmessaging-only\u201d tool profile** for classification runs so the model can\u2019t execute shell commands or touch the filesystem by default. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view3\ue201  \n3) Use **read-only OAuth scopes** where possible (gogcli supports `--readonly` for least privilege). \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201  \n4) Keep \u201capply labels / send replies\u201d behind approvals (or do a two-pass flow: classify \u2192 export results \u2192 you review \u2192 then label).  \n5) Consider **local model** only if you can run a sufficiently strong one; otherwise accept that email content is going to a third-party model provider and evaluate that risk explicitly. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search1\ue202turn12search0\ue201  \n6) Run `clawdbot security audit --fix` after configuration changes. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- **Clawdbot is a serious, self-hosted agent platform**: multi-channel chat, tools, skills, automation, multi-agent routing, and an explicit security model (pairing/allowlists/sandbox/tool controls). \ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue202turn11view1\ue202turn16view3\ue201  \n- It can **absolutely help with Gmail triage**\u2014especially by combining Gmail search via gogcli with event-driven hooks (Pub/Sub) and LLM summarization/classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue202turn18view0\ue201  \n- The biggest \u201cgotcha\u201d is not capability\u2014it\u2019s **operational and security discipline**.

When it receives messages, it sends a notification to `+B`.\n\n**Pros:** simplest; only one WhatsApp login.  \n**Cons:** the alert on B comes from number A (not a separate \u201cbot\u201d identity).\n\nKey detail: outbound sends require the gateway to be running (active listener). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Setup option B (cleaner): two WhatsApp accounts inside Clawdbot\nIf you want the alert to come from a *different* WhatsApp identity (e.g., a dedicated \u201cassistant\u201d number), log in **two WhatsApp accounts** with distinct `accountId`s and choose which one sends the alert. Multi-account login is explicitly supported. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn1view2\ue201  \n\n### 1) Configure two WhatsApp accounts + routing\nExample `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` (JSON5):\n\n```js\n{\n  agents: {\n    list: [\n      { id: \"forwarder\", default: true, workspace: \"~/clawd-forwarder\" }\n    ]\n  },\n\n  // Route all inbound messages from the monitored WhatsApp account to this agent\n  bindings: [\n    { agentId: \"forwarder\", match: { channel: \"whatsapp\", accountId: \"monitor\" } }\n  ],\n\n  channels: {\n    whatsapp: {\n      accounts: {\n        monitor: {},   // phone number you want to monitor\n        notify: {}     // phone number you want to send alerts FROM (optional)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nClawdbot supports multi-account login via:\n- `clawdbot channels login --account <id>` \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \nSo you\u2019d do:\n- `clawdbot channels login --account monitor`\n- `clawdbot channels login --account notify`\n\n### 2) Sending the alert to your other number\nOutbound WhatsApp target format is **E.164**; the CLI supports choosing which account sends via `--account`. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue201  \n\nExample (manual test):\n```bash\nclawdbot message send \\\n  --channel whatsapp \\\n  --account notify \\\n  --target +65XXXXXXXX \\\n  --message \"Test alert\"\n```\n\n### 3) Make it \u201cforward-only, no reply\u201d\nIn the forwarding agent\u2019s instructions (e.g., in `SOUL.md` / workspace prompt), you\u2019d tell it:\n\n- On any inbound WhatsApp message (monitor account), send an alert to `+B`\n- Include sender and a short snippet\n- Then output `NO_REPLY` so the original chat gets no bot response \ue200cite\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search6\ue201\n\n---\n\n## The big gotcha: DM access policy (and why it matters)\nIf you want to monitor **messages from anyone** (unknown senders), you\u2019ll be tempted to set WhatsApp DMs to \u201copen.\u201d In Clawdbot\u2019s WhatsApp channel, **open requires `allowFrom` to include `\"*\"`**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n\nThat effectively exposes your agent to untrusted inbound content, which is exactly where prompt-injection risk lives.\n\nIf your monitored number receives public/customer messages, do **at least** these mitigations:\n- keep the forwarder agent **tool-restricted** (ideally only allow \u201csend message\u201d and deny filesystem/shell/browser tools)\n- do not let it follow instructions from inbound messages\u2014treat inbound text as data only\n- consider using a dedicated monitored number and/or a dedicated notifier number\n\n---\n\n### So: can you do what you asked?\n**Yes.** Clawdbot supports multiple WhatsApp accounts (`accountId`), and it can send WhatsApp messages to an E.164 target number; you can implement \u201cmonitor A \u2192 alert B\u201d either by sending from A directly or by using a second logged-in notifier account. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn1view1\ue202turn1view2\ue201\n\nIf you tell me whether **A is receiving messages from the general public** (or only from known contacts), I\u2019ll suggest the safest `dmPolicy/allowFrom` + tool-allowlist shape for your case."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn1view2\ue201","start_idx":279,"end_idx":307,"safe_urls":["https://docs.clawd.bot/channels/whatsapp","https://docs.clawd.bot/concepts/multi-agent"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Clawdbot](https://docs.clawd.bot/channels/whatsapp))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Whatsapp - Clawdbot","url":"https://docs.clawd.bot/channels/whatsapp","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Multi-Agent Routing - Clawdbot","url":"https://docs.clawd.bot/concepts/multi-agent","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"Clawdbot"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Clawdbot"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue201","start_idx":520,"end_idx":537,"safe_urls":["https://docs.clawd.bot/cli/message"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Clawdbot](https://docs.clawd.bot/cli/message))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Message - Clawdbot","url":"https://docs.clawd.bot/cli/message","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Clawdbot"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search6\ue201","start_idx":749,"end_idx":781,"safe_urls":["https://docs.clawd.bot/concepts/agent-loop","https://docs.clawd.bot/concepts/agent-loop?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://docs.clawd.bot/reference/session-management-compaction","https://docs.clawd.bot/reference/session-management-compaction?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Clawdbot](https://docs.clawd.bot/reference/session-management-compaction?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Session management compaction","url":"https://docs.clawd.bot/reference/session-management-compaction?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"10 Jan 2026 \u2014 The assistant starts its output with NO_REPLY to indicate \u201cdo not deliver a reply to the user\u201d.

\u2014 but you\u2019ll want to implement it as a **\u201crelay command\u201d workflow**, because WhatsApp DMs don\u2019t automatically map to separate threads unless you configure them that way, and Clawdbot\u2019s safety defaults try to prevent \u201csend to random other targets from this chat.\u201d\n\n### What it can look like in practice\n\n#### Pattern 1 (simplest): explicit target\nFrom WhatsApp **number B** (your control number), you message Clawdbot something like:\n\n- `/send +65XXXXXXXX <your text>`\n\nClawdbot then sends **exactly `<your text>`** out via WhatsApp **account A** to `+65XXXXXXXX`.\n\nThe CLI equivalent shows how targeting works (WhatsApp targets are E.164 numbers, and multi-account sends use an `account` id). \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue202turn4view3\ue201\n\n#### Pattern 2 (more ergonomic): reply-to-alert\nHave the alert include a routing token, e.g.:\n\n- the sender\u2019s E.164 (`+65\u2026`), or\n- the per-sender session key (see below)\n\nThen on number B you **hit \u201cReply\u201d** on the alert and type:\n\n- `/send <your text>`\n\nClawdbot will see the quoted alert text because WhatsApp quoted reply context is appended into what the model receives. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## The important config knob that makes this clean\nSet DM sessions to be **per sender**, so Clawdbot can keep a stable \u201cthread\u201d per recipient:\n\n```js\n{\n  session: { dmScope: \"per-channel-peer\" }\n}\n```\n\nWith `per-channel-peer`, direct messages become session keys like:\n`agent:<agentId>:whatsapp:dm:<peerId>` \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201\n\nThat gives you a reliable routing token you can include in alerts.\n\n---\n\n## Two gotchas you should expect\n\n### 1) Outgoing WhatsApp \u201creply threading\u201d isn\u2019t supported\nEven if you \u201creply\u201d on number B to an alert, the message that goes out to the recipient will be a **plain WhatsApp message**, not a quoted/threaded reply \u2014 Clawdbot\u2019s WhatsApp Web gateway currently ignores reply tags. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view3\ue201\n\n### 2) You\u2019ll likely implement the relay using session tools (not a naive send)\nClawdbot notes that when the `message` tool is called from inside an active chat session, sends are constrained to that session\u2019s target to prevent cross-context leaks. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201  \nSo the usual robust design is:\n\n- control chat (B) parses `/send \u2026` + finds the target (from the quoted alert or explicit `+65\u2026`)\n- then uses the **session tool** to run the send in the *target* context (either `sessions_send` or `sessions_spawn`, both documented) \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## \u201cVerbatim\u201d forwarding\nYou can get close to \u201cverbatim\u201d by making it a hard rule in your relay instructions:\n\n- Everything after `/send ` is **data**, not content to rewrite.\n- Send it exactly; don\u2019t add greeting/signature; don\u2019t paraphrase.\n\nThis is usually done in the agent\u2019s workspace instructions (SOUL/TOOLS prompt), and works best when your control agent is tool-restricted (e.g., tools profile `messaging`). \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me one detail \u2014 **do you want the outbound forwarded message to come from A (the monitored number) or from B (the control number)?** \u2014 I\u2019ll give you the cleanest relay design for that choice (they\u2019re slightly different in routing and account selection)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue202turn4view3\ue201","start_idx":697,"end_idx":725,"safe_urls":["https://docs.clawd.bot/channels/whatsapp","https://docs.clawd.bot/cli/message"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Clawdbot](https://docs.clawd.bot/cli/message))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Message

Developed by Peter Steinberger, the tool is praised for running locally on devices, offering privacy benefits compared to cloud-based AI services. Unlike typical AI models that forget tasks, Clawdbot operates continuously, making it appealing to engineers and entrepreneurs.\n\nIts popularity has sparked a resurgence of interest in older computers like Intel MacBooks and particularly in Mac Minis, which users are repurposing to run Clawdbot. This led to a surge in Mac Mini sales and memes across social media.

Developed by Peter Steinberger, the tool is praised for running locally on devices, offering privacy benefits compared to cloud-based AI services. Unlike typical AI models that forget tasks, Clawdbot operates continuously, making it appealing to engineers and entrepreneurs.\n\nIts popularity has sparked a resurgence of interest in older computers like Intel MacBooks and particularly in Mac Minis, which users are repurposing to run Clawdbot. This led to a surge in Mac Mini sales and memes across social media. Despite the enthusiasm, concerns persist regarding Clawdbot\u2019s technical setup complexity and potential security risks, given the level of access it requires to a user's data. Critics warn that the lack of guardrails makes it vulnerable, though Steinberger has advised on safe usage practices. While some see Clawdbot as a step toward practical AGI, others are wary of handing over too much control to AI.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":12},"pub_date":1769502601.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"github.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/blob/main/package.json","title":"clawdbot/package.json at main","snippet":"Your own personal AI assistant.

\n- A MacStories update dated **January 27, 2026** states: \u201cClawdbot has been renamed to Moltbot\u201d and attributes it to a **trademark-related request by Anthropic**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue201  \n- On GitHub, releases are being published under the **@moltbot** account (e.g., \u201cClawdbot 2026.1.24\u201d shows @moltbot as the publisher). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search13\ue201  \n\nThat said, the rebrand looks **in-progress / partially propagated**:\n- The GitHub repo is still titled **\u201cClawdbot \u2014 Personal AI Assistant\u201d** and continues to use the `clawdbot` naming in docs links and CLI examples. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201  \n- There\u2019s also legacy/stray naming like \u201cclawdis\u201d still visible in community surfaces (e.g., a pinned discussion titled \u201cWelcome to clawdis Discussions!\u201d). \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201  \n- Some docs now live on `docs.molt.bot` but still refer to \u201cClawdbot\u201d in-page. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n\n**Practical implication:** expect a period where you\u2019ll see *Clawdbot / Moltbot / clawd / molty / clawdis* used inconsistently
