Prices Are Up 25% Already In 2026. Can They Keep Rising?","snippet":"As of early 2026, silver prices have surged dramatically, rising 25% in just the first two weeks of the year after a near-150% increase in 2025. Spot prices hit a record high above $93 per ounce before settling near $90. This continuous rally is fueled largely by geopolitical instability, sustained investor demand, and macroeconomic factors including Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a weakening U.S. dollar, rising inflation, and global debt concerns. \n\nNotably, investor interest has intensified, with retail buyers funnelling nearly $922 million into silver-linked exchange-traded funds recently, marking a significant shift toward treating silver as a core portfolio asset rather than a speculative investment. Additionally, stockpiling in the U.S. disrupted global silver flows, particularly in London, amid tariff threats by former President Trump (later eased). Analysts suggest this rally differs from past frenzies, indicating a more fundamental, long-term shift in investment strategy. If these contributing factors persist, experts believe the silver price momentum could continue.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1768595574.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"goldsilver.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://goldsilver.com/industry-news/article/why-silver-prices-are-rising-and-what-comes-next/","title":"Why Silver Prices Are Rising \u2014 And What Comes Next - GoldSilver","snippet":"Why Silver Prices Are Rising: A structural supply deficit, sovereign demand, Fed policy shifts, & volatility are driving silver's market.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":39},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"goldsilver.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.cbsnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-price-of-silver-hit-100-per-ounce-january-2026/","title":"Will the price of silver hit $100 per ounce this January? 3 things to ...","snippet":"Sticky inflation can often cause the price of precious metals to rise as investors move into the market to help hedge against the corrosive ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1768363157.404518,"attribution":"www.cbsnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.forbes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2026/01/13/silver-hits-new-high-of-88-as-gold-price-steadies/","title":"Silver Hits New High Of $88 As Gold Price Steadies - Forbes","snippet":"Several factors converged to make precious metal prices rise, including interest rate cuts and geopolitical uncertainty, such as the United ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1768277141.086572,"attribution":"www.forbes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.forex.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/silver-forecast-technical-tuesday-january-13-2026/","title":"Silver forecast: Technical Tuesday | January 13, 2026 - FOREX.com","snippet":"While silver has been supported by many other factors including haven demand and interest rate cuts, the main factor behind the eye-watering ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1768277141.086572,"attribution":"www.forex.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/rising-gold-and-silver-prices-led-to-jewellers-suicide/articleshow/126590849.cms","title":"'Rising gold and silver prices led to jeweller's suicide'","snippet":"A prominent jeweller, Manoj Agarwal, was found dead by suicide in the Saadatganj area of Lucknow.

This rally has far surpassed gold's 73% rise over the same period. However, analysts warn that further gains may be constrained by weakening industrial demand due to high prices. Silver is unique in serving both as a precious metal and a critical industrial component in sectors like solar energy, electronics, and AI-related chips. Despite benefiting from supply shocks and high demand\u2014exacerbated by low inventories and geopolitical factors\u2014industries are beginning to cut back. Chinese solar firms Longi Green Energy Technology and Jinko Solar, for example, are shifting to cheaper base metals as substitutes. Ole Hansen from Saxo Bank noted that at a certain cost, fabricators can no longer absorb rising prices, leading to usage reductions or alternative sourcing. While slower industrial buying may take time to shift market sentiment, it could eventually temper silver's explosive rally.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1768550709.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/09aa1ffc-3776-4c72-8342-47d4d1bd5186","title":"Gold hits record high and dollar weakens on Fed independence worries","snippet":"Gold surged to a record high of over $4,600 per troy ounce, and silver rose 7.8% to exceed $86, following news of a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell. The probe, related to Powell\u2019s congressional testimony about a $2.5 billion Fed headquarters renovation, raised serious concerns over central bank independence, prompting market fears that political pressure could suppress U.S. interest rates and stoke long-term inflation. The U.S. dollar weakened 0.3% against major currencies, while the 10-year Treasury yield briefly peaked at 4.21% before easing to 4.18%.\n\nInvestors moved towards gold and silver amid geopolitical turmoil, including U.S. military tensions with Iran and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Analysts suggest a \"debasement trade\" is under way, with heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid fears of dollar devaluation.

hits record high and dollar weakens on Fed independence worries","snippet":"Gold surged to a record high of over $4,600 per troy ounce, and silver rose 7.8% to exceed $86, following news of a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell. The probe, related to Powell\u2019s congressional testimony about a $2.5 billion Fed headquarters renovation, raised serious concerns over central bank independence, prompting market fears that political pressure could suppress U.S. interest rates and stoke long-term inflation. The U.S. dollar weakened 0.3% against major currencies, while the 10-year Treasury yield briefly peaked at 4.21% before easing to 4.18%.\n\nInvestors moved towards gold and silver amid geopolitical turmoil, including U.S. military tensions with Iran and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Analysts suggest a \"debasement trade\" is under way, with heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid fears of dollar devaluation. Though market reactions were moderate, some experts warned that increasing political interference, particularly from the Trump administration, may further undermine central bank autonomy and weigh on dollar assets. Inflation expectations also inched higher, with 10-year breakeven rates climbing to 2.3%, and concerns growing over a potential Maga-aligned Fed appointee.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1768199881.736,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/46999508-88ee-470b-902b-177bacb374da","title":"Retail stampede fuels silver's wild rally","snippet":"2 days ago \u2014 EU readies \u20ac93bn tariffs in retaliation for Trump's Greenland threat ... eased, prompted silver to start flowing back to London.

The inquiry concerns Powell's testimony to the Senate regarding a $2.5 billion renovation of Federal Reserve buildings, though Powell and critics argue the investigation is politically motivated due to his resistance to lowering interest rates in line with President Trump's preferences.\n\nAll living former Fed chairs have condemned the action as unprecedented and dangerous. Market response has been swift: the U.S. dollar has weakened (down 0.35%), and gold surged to a new record above $4,600 an ounce, reflecting investor anxiety. Wall Street indices also reacted negatively.\n\nGoldman Sachs and other economic analysts warned the probe reinforces concerns over monetary policy being influenced by political pressure. Leading Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, oppose moving forward with Trump\u2019s Fed nominees, suspecting an agenda to undermine central bank autonomy. Meanwhile, Powell maintains his commitment to data-driven policy and public service, despite legal pressure. The controversy comes ahead of Powell\u2019s term ending in May, with speculation on a politicized successor growing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1768234999.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"time.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/7345448/jerome-powell-trump-federal-reserve-doj-investigation-renovations/","title":"What to Know About the Investigation Into Jerome Powell","snippet":"A criminal investigation has been launched against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., reportedly over alleged mismanagement of the Fed\u2019s $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project. Approved by Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the probe includes scrutiny of spending records and Powell\u2019s statements to Congress. Powell, who was appointed by Trump in 2018, contends that rising costs were driven by tariffs, inflation, and unforeseen complications such as asbestos and soil contamination. He argues the investigation is politically motivated due to his resistance to Trump\u2019s pressure to lower interest rates.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, suggesting suing or firing him\u2014actions legally limited by Fed independence protections. The DOJ\u2019s involvement, directed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, has sparked bipartisan concern about the erosion of central bank independence and political influence over monetary policy. The situation has rattled financial markets and raised fears about U.S. economic stability and governance.\n\nThe Fed defends the renovation\u2019s necessity, citing outdated infrastructure and cost-saving goals. The probe follows broader efforts by the Trump Administration to investigate critics, including Fed Governor Lisa Cook and others. Lawmakers and market experts warn of serious consequences for U.S. financial credibility and institutional integrity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768212900.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"goldinvest.de","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://goldinvest.de/en/silver-above-84-goldman-sachs-sees-extreme-price-sensitivity-due-to-tight-inventories/","title":"Silver Above $84: Goldman Sachs Sees Extreme Price ...","snippet":"7 days ago \u2014 ... 2026, which require official approval for silver exports.

\u201clocation problem\u201d (London vs U.S. vaults)**\n- Reuters explicitly mentions **tightening inventories** alongside demand. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n- Reports also describe a disruption of normal physical flows\u2014**metal pulled into U.S. warehouses (partly around tariff concerns) leaving London tighter**\u2014which can create squeeze-like conditions. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue202turn1view2\ue201  \n\n**5) A longer-running structural backdrop: multi-year supply deficits + inelastic supply**\n- The Silver Institute has described the market as heading for a **fifth successive structural deficit**, and notes that industrial demand remains large even as \u201cthrifting\u201d (using less silver per unit) increases when prices spike. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue202turn1view5\ue201  \n- Supply is also **slow to respond** because much silver production is a **by-product** of other metals, so higher silver prices don\u2019t instantly create new mine supply. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view5\ue201  \n\n**6) Industrial demand themes help\u2026 but can also cap the rally**\n- Silver benefits from being both a precious metal and an industrial input (solar, electronics, chips). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue201  \n- But at very high prices, **industrial \u201cdemand destruction\u201d** (buyers reduce usage or switch materials) becomes more likely; Business Insider cites large solar manufacturers exploring substitution. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue201  \n\n**7) Momentum/technical reflexivity**\n- Some strategists note the move has become **reflexive** (momentum feeds itself), with rising volatility and \u201coverbought\u201d technicals. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view6\ue201  \n\n### The cleanest way to think about it\n- **Why it spiked now:** rate-cut bets + USD weakness + geopolitical/political risk + ETF inflows + tight physical inventories. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn1view1\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn1view2\ue201  \n- **Why it had fuel to spike:** multi-year deficits and sluggish supply response. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue202turn1view5\ue201  \n\n### What could stop or reverse it (watch these)\n- **Hotter inflation / fewer Fed cuts** \u2192 higher real yields, stronger dollar. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn1view1\ue201  \n- **Physical normalization** (metal flows back to London; inventories rebuild). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue202turn1view2\ue201  \n- **Industrial pullback/substitution** accelerating (especially solar/electronics). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn1view4\ue201  \n\nIf you tell me *which timeframe* you mean by \u201csharp rise\u201d (e.g., last 2 weeks vs last 6 months), I can map the drivers more tightly to that exact move using the most relevant news/market catalysts in that window."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200finance\ue202turn0finance0\ue201","start_idx":0,"end_idx":23,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"finance","ref_index":0}],"alt":"##

The probe, related to Powell\u2019s congressional testimony about a $2.5 billion Fed headquarters renovation, raised serious concerns over central bank independence, prompting market fears that political pressure could suppress U.S. interest rates and stoke long-term inflation. The U.S. dollar weakened 0.3% against major currencies, while the 10-year Treasury yield briefly peaked at 4.21% before easing to 4.18%.\n\nInvestors moved towards gold and silver amid geopolitical turmoil, including U.S. military tensions with Iran and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Analysts suggest a \"debasement trade\" is under way, with heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid fears of dollar devaluation. Though market reactions were moderate, some experts warned that increasing political interference, particularly from the Trump administration, may further undermine central bank autonomy and weigh on dollar assets. Inflation expectations also inched higher, with 10-year breakeven rates climbing to 2.3%, and concerns growing over a potential Maga-aligned Fed appointee.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"What to Know About the Investigation Into Jerome Powell","url":"https://time.com/7345448/jerome-powell-trump-federal-reserve-doj-investigation-renovations/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"A criminal investigation has been launched against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., reportedly over alleged mismanagement of the Fed\u2019s $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project. Approved by Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the probe includes scrutiny of spending records and Powell\u2019s statements to Congress. Powell, who was appointed by Trump in 2018, contends that rising costs were driven by tariffs, inflation, and unforeseen complications such as asbestos and soil contamination. He argues the investigation is politically motivated due to his resistance to Trump\u2019s pressure to lower interest rates.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, suggesting suing or firing him\u2014actions legally limited by Fed independence protections. The DOJ\u2019s involvement, directed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, has sparked bipartisan concern about the erosion of central bank independence and political influence over monetary policy. The situation has rattled financial markets and raised fears about U.S. economic stability and governance.\n\nThe Fed defends the renovation\u2019s necessity, citing outdated infrastructure and cost-saving goals. The probe follows broader efforts by the Trump Administration to investigate critics, including Fed Governor Lisa Cook and others.

Spot silver advanced 3.3% to $92.93 per ounce, reaching a peak of $94.08.\n\nTrump\u2019s controversial push to acquire Greenland, backed by threats of increasing tariffs on European allies, triggered a flight to safe-haven assets amid fears of political and economic instability. EU diplomats stressed their efforts to dissuade Trump while preparing retaliatory measures. Analysts cited geopolitical risks and low interest rates as drivers of gold and silver demand. Additionally, the gold-silver ratio dropped sharply, highlighting silver\u2019s stronger performance. Other precious metals also gained, with platinum up 0.9% and palladium rising 0.5%. The broader market reflected risk aversion, with declines in U.S. stocks and the dollar, and increased demand for the yen and Swiss franc.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1768794991.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/retail-investors-steer-record-amount-cash-into-silver-creating-crowded-trade-2026-01-15/","title":"Retail investors steer record amount cash into silver, creating crowded trade","snippet":"Retail investors have poured record amounts of cash into silver, making it the most crowded commodity trade in the market, according to a report by Vanda Research. Over the past 30 days, nearly $922 million has flowed into silver-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), which saw $69.2 million from retail investors in a single day\u2014the second highest in history after a 2021 surge. The price of silver has jumped significantly, trading at $91.90 per ounce, a steep rise from $72.62 at the start of the year and nearing record highs above $93. Silver prices and related equities have soared, with the MSCI ACWI Select Silver Miners Investable Index climbing 225% over the past year and the SLV ETF itself rising over 210%.\n\nUnlike the 2021 \"meme stock\" frenzy, Vanda argues this rally is structurally driven, suggesting silver should now be treated as a core macro trading asset. The involvement of retail investors in both bullish and bearish ETFs, including the ProShares UltraShort Silver (ZSL), reflects growing retail market influence. However, some analysts caution against over-optimism, noting silver\u2019s rapid rise from below $50 to over $80 in just three months.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768516512.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-prices-slip-lower-us-inflation-figures-firmer-dollar-2025-12-19/","title":"Silver climbs to record high, gold posts weekly gain on rate ...","snippet":"19 Dec 2025 \u2014 Silver soared to a record high on Friday, bolstered by investment demand and a supply tightness, while gold posted a weekly gain buoyed by ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1766118600.278,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/silver-shines-2025-global-market-spotlight-softs-oil-lag-2025-12-31/","title":"Silver shines in 2025 global market spotlight as softs, oil lag","snippet":"31 Dec 2025 \u2014 Silver gained 161% in 2025, breaking the $80 per ounce mark for the first time, while gold climbed 66%.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1767153968.574,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-near-record-highs-fed-rate-cut-bets-silver-cracks-90-2026-01-14/","title":"Gold, silver extend record-breaking rallies as uncertainty ...","snippet":"4 days ago \u2014 Gold surged to a record high on Wednesday, with silver rising in its wake, as geopolitical and economic uncertainties drove investors toward ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1768364777.424,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-kotak-lift-silver-etf-investment-curbs-few-weeks-exec-says-2025-10-10/","title":"India's Kotak to lift silver ETF investment curbs in few ...","snippet":"10 Oct 2025 \u2014 Silver ETFs have drawn 86.03 billion rupees ($969 million) in inflows during the first eight months of 2025, surpassing last year's total.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15},"pub_date":1760083251.239,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-flat-higher-yields-counter-weak-dollar-ahead-us-inflation-read-2025-12-05/","title":"Gold gains on Fed rate cut optimism; silver hits record high","snippet":"5 Dec 2025 \u2014 Gold prices rose on Friday as mounting expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut next week buoyed sentiment, while silver soared to a ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},"pub_date":1764908101.69,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/silver-prices-are-up-25-percent-already-in-2026-can-they-keep-rising-11886612","title":"Silver Prices Are Up 25% Already In 2026.

Spot prices hit a record high above $93 per ounce before settling near $90. This continuous rally is fueled largely by geopolitical instability, sustained investor demand, and macroeconomic factors including Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a weakening U.S. dollar, rising inflation, and global debt concerns. \n\nNotably, investor interest has intensified, with retail buyers funnelling nearly $922 million into silver-linked exchange-traded funds recently, marking a significant shift toward treating silver as a core portfolio asset rather than a speculative investment. Additionally, stockpiling in the U.S. disrupted global silver flows, particularly in London, amid tariff threats by former President Trump (later eased). Analysts suggest this rally differs from past frenzies, indicating a more fundamental, long-term shift in investment strategy. If these contributing factors persist, experts believe the silver price momentum could continue.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1768595574.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"goldsilver.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://goldsilver.com/industry-news/article/silver-price-forecast-predictions/","title":"Silver Price Predictions 2026: After a 147% Surge, What's ...","snippet":"Silver jumped from $28.92 to over $70 in 2025 due to record industrial demand, shrinking inventories, and a fifth consecutive global supply deficit.

eases as US jobs data lifts dollar, Trump softens tone on Iran","snippet":"Gold prices dipped slightly on Thursday, influenced by better-than-expected U.S. jobless claims data and a stronger dollar, which made gold more expensive for international buyers. Spot gold declined 0.1% to $4,614.93 per ounce after setting a record high of $4,642.72 the previous day. U.S. gold futures for February also settled 0.3% lower at $4,623.70. Analysts suggested this decline was a corrective movement and expected investors to see these downticks as buying opportunities.\n\nThe decrease in gold prices was further impacted by a softened geopolitical stance from U.S. President Donald Trump, who indicated no immediate actions regarding Iran and maintained support for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell amid a criminal probe. This reduction in geopolitical tension lessened the safe-haven demand for gold.\n\nMeanwhile, other precious metals recorded mixed results: silver was down 0.3% to $92.50 after a record high earlier in the session, platinum fell 0.8% to $2,404.18, and palladium remained steady at $1,826.32.

The rally is fueled by fears surrounding U.S. tariff policies, including President Trump's plan to introduce a 50% tariff on copper from August 1, and existing tariffs on Mexican imports, which have influenced premiums in U.S. futures versus London benchmarks and contributed to higher spot market lease rates.\n\nDespite being excluded from reciprocal tariffs, silver is experiencing increased investor demand as a cheaper alternative to gold and due to continued structural supply deficits, driving industrial demand. Experts suggest silver could hit $42 per ounce this year. The gold-to-silver price ratio has improved to 87, down from 105 in April, indicating stronger performance for silver. Still, some analysts caution that stretched positioning could lead to a short-term correction to $35 before climbing to $45 in 2026.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1753280671.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/silver-soars-record-high-riding-golds-coattails-2025-10-08/","title":"Silver soars to record high, riding gold's coattails","snippet":"8 Oct 2025 \u2014 Spot silver hit an all-time high at $49.57 per ounce.

This rally is fueled by strong industrial demand and persistent supply deficits. Spot silver rose 2.5% to $35.82, marking a 24% increase for the year. Analysts highlight silver's growing role in industrial sectors like solar energy and electrification, which has sustained demand despite broader economic headwinds.\n\nThe gold-silver ratio has declined to around 94 from 105 in April, indicating silver\u2019s rising value relative to gold. Analysts suggest that silver's longstanding underperformance compared to gold may now be driving ratio trading. Silver is currently in its fifth consecutive year of structural supply deficit, with limited potential for increased supply due to its status as a mining by-product.\n\nLooking ahead, experts anticipate further gains, with some projecting silver prices could reach $40 to $50 per ounce, supported by continued industrial use and macroeconomic factors such as anticipated U.S. rate cuts and overall strength in precious metals.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":1749133449.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/silver-shines-2025-global-market-spotlight-softs-oil-lag-2025-12-31/","title":"Silver shines in 2025 global market spotlight as softs, oil lag","snippet":"31 Dec 2025 \u2014 Silver gained 161% in 2025, breaking the $80 per ounce mark for the first time, while gold climbed 66%.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1767153968.574,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-trades-near-record-highs-us-rate-cut-bets-silver-14-year-high-2025-09-01/","title":"Gold trades near record highs on US rate cut bets; silver at ...","snippet":"1 Sept 2025 \u2014 Spot silver jumped 2.6% to $40.69 per ounce, its highest since September 2011.

This rally has far surpassed gold's 73% rise over the same period. However, analysts warn that further gains may be constrained by weakening industrial demand due to high prices. Silver is unique in serving both as a precious metal and a critical industrial component in sectors like solar energy, electronics, and AI-related chips. Despite benefiting from supply shocks and high demand\u2014exacerbated by low inventories and geopolitical factors\u2014industries are beginning to cut back. Chinese solar firms Longi Green Energy Technology and Jinko Solar, for example, are shifting to cheaper base metals as substitutes. Ole Hansen from Saxo Bank noted that at a certain cost, fabricators can no longer absorb rising prices, leading to usage reductions or alternative sourcing. While slower industrial buying may take time to shift market sentiment, it could eventually temper silver's explosive rally.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1768550709.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/silver-prices-are-up-25-percent-already-in-2026-can-they-keep-rising-11886612","title":"Silver Prices Are Up 25% Already In 2026. Can They Keep Rising?","snippet":"As of early 2026, silver prices have surged dramatically, rising 25% in just the first two weeks of the year after a near-150% increase in 2025. Spot prices hit a record high above $93 per ounce before settling near $90. This continuous rally is fueled largely by geopolitical instability, sustained investor demand, and macroeconomic factors including Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a weakening U.S. dollar, rising inflation, and global debt concerns. \n\nNotably, investor interest has intensified, with retail buyers funnelling nearly $922 million into silver-linked exchange-traded funds recently, marking a significant shift toward treating silver as a core portfolio asset rather than a speculative investment. Additionally, stockpiling in the U.S. disrupted global silver flows, particularly in London, amid tariff threats by former President Trump (later eased). Analysts suggest this rally differs from past frenzies, indicating a more fundamental, long-term shift in investment strategy. If these contributing factors persist, experts believe the silver price momentum could continue.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1768595574.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"sg.finance.yahoo.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-near-record-highs-fed-042559505.html","title":"Gold notches record high, silver cracks $90 on Fed rate cut ...","snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 Spot silver jumped 4.2% to $90.59 per ounce after breaching $90 for the first time, having shot up nearly 27% already this year. \"U.S. CPI ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"sg.finance.yahoo.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.lseg.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.lseg.com/en/insights/ftse-russell/a-standout-year-for-gold-and-silver","title":"A standout year for gold and silver","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Gold and silver surged in 2025, outperforming global markets.

EU diplomats stressed their efforts to dissuade Trump while preparing retaliatory measures. Analysts cited geopolitical risks and low interest rates as drivers of gold and silver demand. Additionally, the gold-silver ratio dropped sharply, highlighting silver\u2019s stronger performance. Other precious metals also gained, with platinum up 0.9% and palladium rising 0.5%.

The involvement of retail investors in both bullish and bearish ETFs, including the ProShares UltraShort Silver (ZSL), reflects growing retail market influence.

This continuous rally is fueled largely by geopolitical instability, sustained investor demand, and macroeconomic factors including Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a weakening U.S. dollar, rising inflation, and global debt concerns. \n\nNotably, investor interest has intensified, with retail buyers funnelling nearly $922 million into silver-linked exchange-traded funds recently, marking a significant shift toward treating silver as a core portfolio asset rather than a speculative investment.

silver hit record highs as Trump's Greenland tariffs spark safety rally","snippet":"Gold and silver prices surged to record highs on Monday, January 19, 2026, as geopolitical tensions escalated following U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to levy new tariffs on European countries over the issue of Greenland\u2019s control. Spot gold rose 1.5% to $4,663.37 per ounce, hitting a record high of $4,689.39, while U.S. gold futures for February climbed to $4,669.90. Spot silver advanced 3.3% to $92.93 per ounce, reaching a peak of $94.08.\n\nTrump\u2019s controversial push to acquire Greenland, backed by threats of increasing tariffs on European allies, triggered a flight to safe-haven assets amid fears of political and economic instability. EU diplomats stressed their efforts to dissuade Trump while preparing retaliatory measures. Analysts cited geopolitical risks and low interest rates as drivers of gold and silver demand. Additionally, the gold-silver ratio dropped sharply, highlighting silver\u2019s stronger performance. Other precious metals also gained, with platinum up 0.9% and palladium rising 0.5%. The broader market reflected risk aversion, with declines in U.S. stocks and the dollar, and increased demand for the yen and Swiss franc.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1768794991.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-silver-notch-record-highs-safe-haven-demand-fed-rate-cut-bets-2026-01-12/","title":"Gold cracks $4600/oz as Fed uncertainty fans safe-haven ...","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Jan 12 (Reuters) - Gold hit a record above $4,600 per ounce on Monday and silver reached a fresh peak as investors piled into safe-haven assets ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1768185939.321,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/gold-prices-scale-three-week-peak-trump-widens-trade-war-2025-07-14/","title":"Gold eases after hitting three-week high","snippet":"14 Jul 2025 \u2014 Gold prices edged lower after hitting a three-week high on Monday, with attention focused on trade talks and US economic data.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1752458034.306,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/record-start-2026-brings-prospect-5000-gold-into-view-2026-01-13/","title":"Record start to 2026 brings prospect of $5000 gold into view","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Spot gold hits a record high of $4,629.94/oz on Jan 12; Silver hits record high at $86.22/oz on Jan 12; Analysts forecast gold to cross $5,000 ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":1768306155.809,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/gold-hits-five-week-high-dollar-yields-ease-spotlight-trade-2025-07-21/","title":"Gold hits five-week high as dollar, yields ease; spotlight on ...","snippet":"21 Jul 2025 \u2014 U.S. gold futures settled 1.4% higher at $3,406.40.

The probe, related to Powell\u2019s congressional testimony about a $2.5 billion Fed headquarters renovation, raised serious concerns over central bank independence, prompting market fears that political pressure could suppress U.S. interest rates and stoke long-term inflation. The U.S. dollar weakened 0.3% against major currencies, while the 10-year Treasury yield briefly peaked at 4.21% before easing to 4.18%.\n\nInvestors moved towards gold and silver amid geopolitical turmoil, including U.S. military tensions with Iran and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Analysts suggest a \"debasement trade\" is under way, with heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid fears of dollar devaluation. Though market reactions were moderate, some experts warned that increasing political interference, particularly from the Trump administration, may further undermine central bank autonomy and weigh on dollar assets. Inflation expectations also inched higher, with 10-year breakeven rates climbing to 2.3%, and concerns growing over a potential Maga-aligned Fed appointee.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768199881.736,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2026/jan/12/us-prosecutors-criminal-investigation-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-dollar-stock-market-gold-bitcoin-business-live-news-updates","title":"Criminal investigation into Fed chair Powell has 'reinforced' concerns over independence, Goldman Sachs warns, as dollar weakens - as it happened","snippet":"A criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, launched by the Department of Justice, has intensified fears that the independence of the U.S. central bank is under political threat from the Trump administration. The inquiry concerns Powell's testimony to the Senate regarding a $2.5 billion renovation of Federal Reserve buildings, though Powell and critics argue the investigation is politically motivated due to his resistance to lowering interest rates in line with President Trump's preferences.\n\nAll living former Fed chairs have condemned the action as unprecedented and dangerous. Market response has been swift: the U.S. dollar has weakened (down 0.35%), and gold surged to a new record above $4,600 an ounce, reflecting investor anxiety. Wall Street indices also reacted negatively.\n\nGoldman Sachs and other economic analysts warned the probe reinforces concerns over monetary policy being influenced by political pressure. Leading Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, oppose moving forward with Trump\u2019s Fed nominees, suspecting an agenda to undermine central bank autonomy. Meanwhile, Powell maintains his commitment to data-driven policy and public service, despite legal pressure. The controversy comes ahead of Powell\u2019s term ending in May, with speculation on a politicized successor growing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1768234999.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"theoregongroup.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://theoregongroup.com/commodities/gold/how-central-bank-gold-demand-is-reshaping-the-global-bullion-market/","title":"How Central Bank gold demand is reshaping the global ...","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1759999409.0,"attribution":"theoregongroup.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gold.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-outlook-2026","title":"Gold Outlook 2026: Push ahead or pull back","snippet":"4 Dec 2025 \u2014 Our analysis shows that, in this environment, gold could rise 5% \u2013 15% in 2026 from current levels,5 depending on the severity of the economic ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1764835200.0,"attribution":"www.gold.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-demand-trends/gold-demand-trends-full-year-2024/central-banks","title":"Central Banks","snippet":"5 Feb 2025 \u2014 Central banks add 1,045t to global gold reserves in 2024; The National Bank of Poland led the charge (90t) but demand was seen from a broad ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.gold.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data","title":"Gold Price Performance & Data","snippet":"Understand the gold market & its current performance with the world-class research and data.

EU diplomats stressed their efforts to dissuade Trump while preparing retaliatory measures. Analysts cited geopolitical risks and low interest rates as drivers of gold and silver demand. Additionally, the gold-silver ratio dropped sharply, highlighting silver\u2019s stronger performance. Other precious metals also gained, with platinum up 0.9% and palladium rising 0.5%. The broader market reflected risk aversion, with declines in U.S. stocks and the dollar, and increased demand for the yen and Swiss franc.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1768794991.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-markets-global-markets-2026-01-12/","title":"Gold leaps to record high, dollar drops as US prosecutors target Fed's Powell","snippet":"Gold surged to a record high of $4,600 per ounce amid investor concern over a criminal investigation targeting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, viewed as part of President Trump's campaign to assert greater control over the central bank. Powell denounced the probe as a pretext to influence monetary policy, warning it threatens the Fed\u2019s independence. The tension contributed to a sell-off in U.S. markets, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures down over 0.6%, and the VIX volatility index climbing significantly. Bond markets began pricing in increased odds of short-term rate cuts.\n\nThe dollar weakened broadly, including against typically risk-sensitive currencies, while traditional safe havens like gold, silver, the Swiss franc, and the euro advanced. Bank stocks led declines on Wall Street following Trump\u2019s call to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, with financial giants like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and American Express logging notable premarket losses. Geopolitical tensions also stirred markets, as the U.S. weighed responses to Iran's crackdown on protests, and events involving Venezuela and Greenland added to instability. Despite the volatility, oil prices dipped slightly, as traders awaited clearer disruption signals, though risk premiums remained due to potential conflict impacts near the Strait of Hormuz.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1768223237.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-falls-1-higher-dollar-yields-weigh-2022-12-28/","title":"Gold falls 1% as higher dollar, yields weigh","snippet":"28 Dec 2022 \u2014 Spot gold fell 0.6% to $1,803.16 per ounce by 1:50 p.m. ET (1850 GMT), after falling to $1,796 earlier in the session.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1672254500.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/gold-slips-hawkish-fed-lifts-us-dollar-yields-2022-01-27/","title":"Gold spirals down as hawkish Fed boosts U.S. dollar","snippet":"28 Jan 2022 \u2014 Spot gold was down 1.3% at $1,794.30 an ounce by 14:04 EST (1904 GMT), after hitting a low of $1,790.20.

The probe, related to Powell\u2019s congressional testimony about a $2.5 billion Fed headquarters renovation, raised serious concerns over central bank independence, prompting market fears that political pressure could suppress U.S. interest rates and stoke long-term inflation. The U.S. dollar weakened 0.3% against major currencies, while the 10-year Treasury yield briefly peaked at 4.21% before easing to 4.18%.\n\nInvestors moved towards gold and silver amid geopolitical turmoil, including U.S. military tensions with Iran and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Analysts suggest a \"debasement trade\" is under way, with heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid fears of dollar devaluation. Though market reactions were moderate, some experts warned that increasing political interference, particularly from the Trump administration, may further undermine central bank autonomy and weigh on dollar assets. Inflation expectations also inched higher, with 10-year breakeven rates climbing to 2.3%, and concerns growing over a potential Maga-aligned Fed appointee.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768199881.736,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"goldprice.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://goldprice.org/gold-price-today/2021-01-19","title":"Gold Price on 19 January 2021","snippet":"19 Jan 2021 \u2014 Spot Gold Price: USD 4,434.92 / Ounce | Spot Silver Price: USD 76.27 ...

This move aims to bolster responsible sourcing and secure data handling.

Announced by LBMA CEO Ruth Crowell at a precious metals conference in Kyoto, this initiative builds on a voluntary reporting system starting in January 2026. The database, launched in January 2025, facilitates faster and more efficient collection and processing of data from refineries listed on LBMA\u2019s \"good delivery\" list, which includes 66 gold and 83 silver refiners worldwide.\n\nThis move comes in response to a 55% rise in gold prices this year, reaching a record high of $4,381 per troy ounce on October 20, driven in part by concerns over U.S. tariffs. Currently, refineries report the origin of sourced material annually; the LBMA aims to transform this into an ongoing, practical dialogue for better oversight without overburdening refiners. Increased transparency and trust in gold sourcing are essential, especially as global markets grow more complex. LBMA's monthly vault data, a vital resource during market fluctuations, will be further strengthened by this initiative.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1761551595.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/d0c79387-3dce-4b7d-9581-66808b653863","title":"Gold price surges after Trump's pressure on Federal Reserve","snippet":"Gold and silver prices hit record highs on Monday, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Gold reached $3,475 per troy ounce at the London Bullion Market Association auction, surpassing its previous high, while spot prices briefly touched $3,489. Silver rose to a 14-year high of $40.76 per ounce. The rally follows political turmoil sparked by President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve, including moves to dismiss Governor Lisa Cook and influence Fed Chair Jay Powell. Market concerns over U.S. institutional independence and safe-haven demand have further boosted gold's appeal. A recent personal consumption expenditure report and Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech have intensified speculation about a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s upcoming September 17 meeting. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainties, inflation fears, and global diversification away from the U.S. dollar have contributed to gold's 33% surge this year. Silver's rise is partly due to speculation it might face future tariffs under Trump\u2019s trade policies, though both precious metals currently remain tariff-free. Lower trading volumes due to the Labor Day holiday contributed to price volatility.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1756740825.355,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696dafd3d0548328a1c69da33154cabc","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for gold price data from January 2021","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"f1055f40-08b4-4e69-88f7-a3204efbd457","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c71d387a-f776-48a0-806c-57ff047fe333","turn_exchange_id":"8f5ca367-9048-4ba3-899d-25d43b36ff1a"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c71d387a-f776-48a0-806c-57ff047fe333","children":["c644bbac-949d-48d3-b4ae-321f544378a4"]},"c644bbac-949d-48d3-b4ae-321f544378a4":{"id":"c644bbac-949d-48d3-b4ae-321f544378a4","message":{"id":"c644bbac-949d-48d3-b4ae-321f544378a4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768796177.824472,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Confirming gold price baseline and 5-year performance","content":"We have the gold price from January 19, 2021, as 1840.40 (from goldprice.org), which seems reasonable, even though it's not from an official source.

Gold reached $3,475 per troy ounce at the London Bullion Market Association auction, surpassing its previous high, while spot prices briefly touched $3,489. Silver rose to a 14-year high of $40.76 per ounce. The rally follows political turmoil sparked by President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve, including moves to dismiss Governor Lisa Cook and influence Fed Chair Jay Powell. Market concerns over U.S. institutional independence and safe-haven demand have further boosted gold's appeal. A recent personal consumption expenditure report and Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech have intensified speculation about a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s upcoming September 17 meeting. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainties, inflation fears, and global diversification away from the U.S. dollar have contributed to gold's 33% surge this year. Silver's rise is partly due to speculation it might face future tariffs under Trump\u2019s trade policies, though both precious metals currently remain tariff-free. Lower trading volumes due to the Labor Day holiday contributed to price volatility.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Financial Times"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":778,"end_idx":795,"safe_urls":["https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-market-commentary-december-2025"],"refs":[],"alt":"([World Gold Council](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-market-commentary-december-2025))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gold Market Commentary: Precious Metal Thunder | World Gold Council","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-market-commentary-december-2025","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"World Gold Council"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1news40\ue201","start_idx":954,"end_idx":985,"safe_urls":["https://www.ft.com/content/09aa1ffc-3776-4c72-8342-47d4d1bd5186","https://www.ft.com/content/09aa1ffc-3776-4c72-8342-47d4d1bd5186?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-silver-notch-record-highs-safe-haven-demand-fed-rate-cut-bets-2026-01-12/","https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-silver-notch-record-highs-safe-haven-demand-fed-rate-cut-bets-2026-01-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-silver-notch-record-highs-safe-haven-demand-fed-rate-cut-bets-2026-01-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gold cracks $4600/oz as Fed uncertainty fans safe-haven ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-silver-notch-record-highs-safe-haven-demand-fed-rate-cut-bets-2026-01-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1768185939.321,"snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Jan 12 (Reuters) - Gold hit a record above $4,600 per ounce on Monday and silver reached a fresh peak as investors piled into safe-haven assets ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Gold hits record high and dollar weakens on Fed independence worries","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/09aa1ffc-3776-4c72-8342-47d4d1bd5186?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Gold surged to a record high of over $4,600 per troy ounce, and silver rose 7.8% to exceed $86, following news of a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell.

silver hit record highs as Trump's Greenland tariffs spark safety rally","snippet":"Gold and silver prices surged to record highs on Monday, January 19, 2026, as geopolitical tensions escalated following U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to levy new tariffs on European countries over the issue of Greenland\u2019s control. Spot gold rose 1.5% to $4,663.37 per ounce, hitting a record high of $4,689.39, while U.S. gold futures for February climbed to $4,669.90. Spot silver advanced 3.3% to $92.93 per ounce, reaching a peak of $94.08.\n\nTrump\u2019s controversial push to acquire Greenland, backed by threats of increasing tariffs on European allies, triggered a flight to safe-haven assets amid fears of political and economic instability. EU diplomats stressed their efforts to dissuade Trump while preparing retaliatory measures. Analysts cited geopolitical risks and low interest rates as drivers of gold and silver demand. Additionally, the gold-silver ratio dropped sharply, highlighting silver\u2019s stronger performance. Other precious metals also gained, with platinum up 0.9% and palladium rising 0.5%. The broader market reflected risk aversion, with declines in U.S. stocks and the dollar, and increased demand for the yen and Swiss franc.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1768794991.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-slips-upbeat-us-data-boosts-dollar-dims-rate-cut-bets-2026-01-16/","title":"Gold falls over 1% as profit\u2011taking, easing geopolitical risks weigh","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},"pub_date":1768539384.387,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/business/etf-edge-rise-of-gold-etfs-raises-concern-of-price-collapse-idUSN28280610/","title":"ETF Edge-Rise of gold ETFs raises concern of price collapse","snippet":"28 Apr 2011 \u2014 ...

Starting February 1, a 10% tariff is proposed, rising to 25% by June 1. This aggressive policy shift has sparked concern across financial markets, with predictions indicating a 0.9% drop in the UK's FTSE 100 and a 0.5% decline in the U.S. Dow Jones index. Safe-haven assets such as gold and silver are seeing increased demand, with gold nearing its record high.\n\nEuropean leaders and business groups have condemned Trump's move, warning of economic disruption and political instability, particularly within NATO. The UK and EU officials called for calm negotiations and criticized the tariffs as harmful to existing trade agreements. German industry groups urged the EU to consider retaliatory measures, while UK businesses warned of a detrimental impact on exports. The situation intensifies pressure on governments to uphold or renegotiate transatlantic trade agreements previously frozen in 2025.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1768741452.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2026/jan/12/us-prosecutors-criminal-investigation-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-dollar-stock-market-gold-bitcoin-business-live-news-updates","title":"Criminal investigation into Fed chair Powell has 'reinforced' concerns over independence, Goldman Sachs warns, as dollar weakens - as it happened","snippet":"A criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, launched by the Department of Justice, has intensified fears that the independence of the U.S. central bank is under political threat from the Trump administration. The inquiry concerns Powell's testimony to the Senate regarding a $2.5 billion renovation of Federal Reserve buildings, though Powell and critics argue the investigation is politically motivated due to his resistance to lowering interest rates in line with President Trump's preferences.\n\nAll living former Fed chairs have condemned the action as unprecedented and dangerous. Market response has been swift: the U.S. dollar has weakened (down 0.35%), and gold surged to a new record above $4,600 an ounce, reflecting investor anxiety. Wall Street indices also reacted negatively.\n\nGoldman Sachs and other economic analysts warned the probe reinforces concerns over monetary policy being influenced by political pressure. Leading Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, oppose moving forward with Trump\u2019s Fed nominees, suspecting an agenda to undermine central bank autonomy. Meanwhile, Powell maintains his commitment to data-driven policy and public service, despite legal pressure. The controversy comes ahead of Powell\u2019s term ending in May, with speculation on a politicized successor growing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1768234999.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/27/gold-price-record-coronavirus-economy-us-china","title":"Gold price hits record high amid fears over coronavirus crisis","snippet":"27 Jul 2020 \u2014 The spot gold price rose 2.3% to $1,944.68 (\u00a31,509) an ounce ...

Central banks acquired 1,136 metric tons, a 152% increase from 2021, to diversify reserves and hedge against inflation and market volatility. This accounted for about a quarter of total demand. Retail investment also rose, pushing overall investment demand up by 10% to 1,107 metric tons, with notable buying from Europe, Turkey, and the Middle East. While retail investors increased purchases of gold bars and coins by 2%, ETFs reduced their holdings. Jewelry remained the largest consumer segment at 46% of demand, though its consumption dropped 3% amid global declines, excluding strong Indian demand. Technology sector gold purchases fell 7% due to poor economic conditions. Despite the strong demand, annual gold supply rose slightly to 4,755 metric tons, fueled by the highest mining output in four years (3,612 metric tons).

Since late 2022, central banks have acquired about 2,200 tons of gold, equivalent to approximately $170 billion, now accounting for over 20% of global demand. This surge follows the 2022 Western sanctions on Russia, which froze $300 billion of its reserves, prompting countries like China, India, and Turkey to hedge against potential future sanctions by diversifying away from the U.S. dollar and increasing gold holdings. China alone has increased its gold reserves by 16% over an 18-month period and could significantly influence global gold supply if it continues reallocating even a small portion of its massive $3.4 trillion reserves into bullion. Despite rising real interest rates and ETF outflows, geopolitical concerns\u2014especially involving China and the West\u2014are making gold increasingly attractive as a sanctions-proof asset.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1716370200.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-hits-another-all-time-high-as-investors-take-cues-from-near-record-buying-by-central-banks-2b3791a6","title":"Gold hits another all-time high as investors take cues from near-record buying by central banks","snippet":"Gold prices reached a new record high on April 5, 2024, closing at $2,345.40 per ounce for June delivery\u2014marking the 13th such milestone this year. While geopolitical tensions and expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts have traditionally boosted gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset, a key driver behind recent gains is robust central bank buying. In both 2022 and 2023, global central banks collectively purchased over 1,000 metric tons of gold, signaling a strategic shift away from U.S. dollar reserves amid concerns of financial sanctions and \"de-dollarization,\" particularly among BRICS nations and emerging markets.\n\nChina led central bank purchases, adding 225 metric tons in 2023\u2014its largest annual increase since at least 1977\u2014as domestic investors seek safer alternatives to its unstable real estate and equity markets. Gold is viewed as a reliable store of value, immune to sanctions or asset freezes, prompting increased accumulation by nations wary of geopolitical risks and currency vulnerabilities. Analysts suggest that consistent central bank buying may act as a long-term price floor for gold, similar to a \"central bank put,\" and expect this trend to persist amidst global economic uncertainty and declining confidence in dollar-based assets.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1712347020.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696db19ca1b8832c965813be8508c226","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for historical gold price data and factors","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5bfa9e24-1fc3-44b2-887d-bd1d74e86c72","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"99bf5c2d-c8c2-49ad-868b-225216de7847","turn_exchange_id":"bfa2cc16-5e17-4a31-8996-f6ed400eeebb"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"99bf5c2d-c8c2-49ad-868b-225216de7847","children":["2dd53669-9e1b-461e-b353-8e5eb361aea2"]},"2dd53669-9e1b-461e-b353-8e5eb361aea2":{"id":"2dd53669-9e1b-461e-b353-8e5eb361aea2","message":{"id":"2dd53669-9e1b-461e-b353-8e5eb361aea2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768796606.093454,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Mapping current gold rally to 2001-2011","content":"We have a great source (Reuters Nov 2025) comparing the 2001-2011 gold rally, which saw gold climb 643%, from about $255-280 to $1900-1921.

Inflation regime & policy path look different**\n- 2001\u20132007 had disinflationary/globalization tailwinds; the big \u201ccurrency debasement\u201d fear surged post-2008 QE (quantitative easing). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- 2022\u20132026 follows a **post-pandemic inflation shock**, then a long period of policy uncertainty (tightening \u2192 expected easing), with a large part of demand framed as **hedging political/fiscal credibility** rather than only \u201cinflation hedge\u201d purity. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news40\ue202turn0news43\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Micro + market-structure: the biggest contrasts\n\n### 1) ETFs: \u201cnew weapon\u201d in 2001\u20132011; \u201cmature plumbing\u201d today\n- **Then:** the launch of **SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)** in **late 2004** was a structural change\u2014making gold exposure easy for institutions/retail; contemporaneous coverage explicitly notes GLD as the first major U.S. gold ETF and discusses the explosive growth of ETF-held metal. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- **Now:** ETFs still matter, but the \u201cnew marginal buyer\u201d story is less about ETFs *existing* and more about **who is buying in size** (notably central banks), sometimes even alongside weak ETF flows. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news41\ue202turn1news40\ue201  \n\n### 2) Central banks: late-cycle pivot in 2010; dominant force in the current rally\n- **Then:** 2010 is described as pivotal because **central banks became net buyers after ~21 years of net sales**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n- **Now:** central-bank buying is described as **exceptionally large and sustained** (e.g., the post-2022 \u201cbinge\u201d narrative), with reporting putting the scale since late-2022 around **~2,200 tons**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news41\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn1search14\ue201  \n\nThis is arguably the **single biggest micro difference**: in 2001\u20132011, central banks became important *near the end*; in the current episode, they are painted as a *core pillar* much earlier.\n\n### 3) The \u201cbuyer mix\u201d today includes a serious competitor asset class\nIn 2001\u20132011, \u201canti-fiat\u201d hedging demand funneled largely into gold and some commodities. Today, **Bitcoin/crypto** competes for a chunk of that narrative-driven flow (even if gold has clearly won the institutional reserve bid recently). This isn\u2019t a single-source \u201cfact\u201d so much as an obvious structural market change; treat it as an inference.\n\n### 4) \u201cPlumbing stress\u201d is less central for gold today than for silver\nIn your silver analysis, a lot hinged on location/inventory dislocations. For gold, current reporting emphasizes **macro + safe haven** rather than a persistent physical squeeze mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news41\ue202turn1news40\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Price action: how the charts \u201crhyme\u201d and how they don\u2019t\n\n### Similarities in price action\n**A.

The \u201cfear premium\u201d spikes near the end**\n- 2011\u2019s peak is associated with intense fear (Guardian reported spot gold around **$1,921/oz on Sep 6, 2011** amid market panic). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search20\ue201  \n- The recent highs are likewise tied to acute political/geopolitical headlines (tariffs, Fed investigation). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news41\ue202turn0news43\ue201  \n\n### Differences in price action\n**A. Magnitude and duration**\n- 2001\u20132011 was a **~10-year, ~7\u00d7** move (various summaries put it roughly from the low-$200s to ~$1,900+). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1news40\ue202turn1search20\ue201  \n- The current run (using Reuters\u2019 framing) is a **~3+ year, ~2.7\u00d7 to Oct 2025** move, then an extension into early 2026. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news40\ue202turn0news41\ue201  \n\n**B. Post-peak precedent risk**\n- After the 2011 peak, gold suffered a **large drawdown** (one summary cites ~45% off the highs). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- Reuters explicitly warns that big historical rallies have often been followed by **long periods of weaker/sideways trading**, and notes forecasters are split on whether the current drivers are structural or temporary. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news40\ue201  \n\n**C. Who provides the \u201cfloor\u201d might be different**\n- In 2011, a lot of the late-stage buying was financial/investor flow-sensitive.  \n- In the current rally, reporting suggests **central banks** may act more like a persistent bid (a \u201cput\u201d), though that cuts both ways: if/when that bid slows, the air pocket could be real. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news41\ue202turn1news40\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## A practical \u201cmapping\u201d (if you want one sentence)\n- **The current rally looks less like the full 2001\u20132011 decade and more like a compressed echo of the 2009\u20132011 endgame**: credibility/fiscal stress narratives + safe-haven urgency + late-stage acceleration\u2014except now the **central-bank bid is bigger and more explicitly tied to sanctions/geopolitical fragmentation**, which did not exist in the same way back then. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news41\ue202turn1news40\ue202turn1search6\ue201  \n\nIf you want, I can also map it quantitatively via a few \u201cstate variables\u201d (real rates, DXY, equity vol, CB net purchases, ETF flows) and show which ones match 2005\u201307 vs 2009\u201311 more closely\u2014using the best available public series."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news40\ue202turn0search20\ue201","start_idx":111,"end_idx":143,"safe_urls":["https://www.cmegroup.com/education/featured-reports/gold-impact-from-us-and-chinese-policies.html","https://www.cmegroup.com/education/featured-reports/gold-impact-from-us-and-chinese-policies.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/golds-rally-looks-huge-only-ranks-third-last-50-years-2025-11-06/","https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/golds-rally-looks-huge-only-ranks-third-last-50-years-2025-11-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/golds-rally-looks-huge-only-ranks-third-last-50-years-2025-11-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gold's rally looks huge, but only ranks third in last 50 years","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/golds-rally-looks-huge-only-ranks-third-last-50-years-2025-11-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1762426800.0,"snippet":"Gold\u2019s recent rally, while impressive, ranks only as the third-largest in the past 50 years, with a 170% gain from October 2022 to its peak of $4,381.21 in October 2025.

This surge follows the 2022 Western sanctions on Russia, which froze $300 billion of its reserves, prompting countries like China, India, and Turkey to hedge against potential future sanctions by diversifying away from the U.S. dollar and increasing gold holdings. China alone has increased its gold reserves by 16% over an 18-month period and could significantly influence global gold supply if it continues reallocating even a small portion of its massive $3.4 trillion reserves into bullion.

The inquiry concerns Powell's testimony to the Senate regarding a $2.5 billion renovation of Federal Reserve buildings, though Powell and critics argue the investigation is politically motivated due to his resistance to lowering interest rates in line with President Trump's preferences.\n\nAll living former Fed chairs have condemned the action as unprecedented and dangerous. Market response has been swift: the U.S. dollar has weakened (down 0.35%), and gold surged to a new record above $4,600 an ounce, reflecting investor anxiety. Wall Street indices also reacted negatively.\n\nGoldman Sachs and other economic analysts warned the probe reinforces concerns over monetary policy being influenced by political pressure. Leading Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, oppose moving forward with Trump\u2019s Fed nominees, suspecting an agenda to undermine central bank autonomy. Meanwhile, Powell maintains his commitment to data-driven policy and public service, despite legal pressure. The controversy comes ahead of Powell\u2019s term ending in May, with speculation on a politicized successor growing.","attribution":"The Guardian"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":4077,"end_idx":4125,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/article/business/etf-edge-rise-of-gold-etfs-raises-concern-of-price-collapse-idUSN28280610/","https://www.reuters.com/article/business/etf-edge-rise-of-gold-etfs-raises-concern-of-price-collapse-idUSN28280610/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1222333/000119312514418637/d824393dfwp.htm","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1222333/000119312514418637/d824393dfwp.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/media/GLD/file/article_333-136016.pdf","https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/media/GLD/file/article_333-136016.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/etf-edge-rise-of-gold-etfs-raises-concern-of-price-collapse-idUSN28280610/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"ETF Edge-Rise of gold ETFs raises concern of price collapse","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/business/etf-edge-rise-of-gold-etfs-raises-concern-of-price-collapse-idUSN28280610/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1304026484.0,"snippet":"28 Apr 2011 \u2014 ...

The inquiry concerns Powell's testimony to the Senate regarding a $2.5 billion renovation of Federal Reserve buildings, though Powell and critics argue the investigation is politically motivated due to his resistance to lowering interest rates in line with President Trump's preferences.\n\nAll living former Fed chairs have condemned the action as unprecedented and dangerous. Market response has been swift: the U.S. dollar has weakened (down 0.35%), and gold surged to a new record above $4,600 an ounce, reflecting investor anxiety. Wall Street indices also reacted negatively.\n\nGoldman Sachs and other economic analysts warned the probe reinforces concerns over monetary policy being influenced by political pressure. Leading Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, oppose moving forward with Trump\u2019s Fed nominees, suspecting an agenda to undermine central bank autonomy. Meanwhile, Powell maintains his commitment to data-driven policy and public service, despite legal pressure. The controversy comes ahead of Powell\u2019s term ending in May, with speculation on a politicized successor growing.","attribution":"The Guardian"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1news40\ue202turn1search20\ue201","start_idx":6762,"end_idx":6807,"safe_urls":["https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/gold-remains-remarkably-resilient","https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/gold-remains-remarkably-resilient?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/golds-rally-looks-huge-only-ranks-third-last-50-years-2025-11-06/","https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/golds-rally-looks-huge-only-ranks-third-last-50-years-2025-11-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/06/gold-hits-new-high-financial-markets","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/06/gold-hits-new-high-financial-markets?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/gold-remains-remarkably-resilient?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gold remains remarkably resilient","url":"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/gold-remains-remarkably-resilient?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"21 Jan 2018 \u2014 During the bull run, gold price increased seven-fold from a low of US$253 to a high of US$1,920.

This surge follows the 2022 Western sanctions on Russia, which froze $300 billion of its reserves, prompting countries like China, India, and Turkey to hedge against potential future sanctions by diversifying away from the U.S. dollar and increasing gold holdings. China alone has increased its gold reserves by 16% over an 18-month period and could significantly influence global gold supply if it continues reallocating even a small portion of its massive $3.4 trillion reserves into bullion.

Since late 2022, central banks have acquired about 2,200 tons of gold, equivalent to approximately $170 billion, now accounting for over 20% of global demand. This surge follows the 2022 Western sanctions on Russia, which froze $300 billion of its reserves, prompting countries like China, India, and Turkey to hedge against potential future sanctions by diversifying away from the U.S. dollar and increasing gold holdings. China alone has increased its gold reserves by 16% over an 18-month period and could significantly influence global gold supply if it continues reallocating even a small portion of its massive $3.4 trillion reserves into bullion. Despite rising real interest rates and ETF outflows, geopolitical concerns\u2014especially involving China and the West\u2014are making gold increasingly attractive as a sanctions-proof asset.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Gold's rally looks huge, but only ranks third in last 50 years","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/golds-rally-looks-huge-only-ranks-third-last-50-years-2025-11-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Gold\u2019s recent rally, while impressive, ranks only as the third-largest in the past 50 years, with a 170% gain from October 2022 to its peak of $4,381.21 in October 2025.

expectations of more accommodating U.S. monetary policies. There are several common ways for investors to gain exposure to gold:\n\n1. **Spot Market**: Primarily used by large buyers and institutions, with London as the dominant hub. This is a real-time market where prices are based on immediate supply and demand.\n   \n2. **Futures Market**: Investors trade contracts to buy or sell gold at a set future date and price. Major exchanges include COMEX (U.S.), Shanghai Futures Exchange (China), and TOCOM (Japan).\n\n3. **Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs/ETFs)**: These securities are backed by physical gold and saw record inflows of $89 billion in 2025, especially from North America.\n\n4. **Physical Gold (Bars and Coins)**: Accessible to retail investors via shops or online dealers.\n\nGold price movements are influenced by investor sentiment, foreign exchange rates (particularly the U.S. dollar), geopolitical tensions, central bank policies, and gold reserve purchases. Growing demand from central banks, notably China, has also supported prices amid global economic uncertainty.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768211146.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cbo-sees-us-deficits-rising-over-30-years-economic-growth-slowing-2025-03-27/","title":"CBO sees US deficits rising over 30 years, economic growth slowing","snippet":"The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that federal budget deficits and public debt will rise sharply over the next 30 years, with deficits increasing from 6.2% of GDP in 2025 to 7.3% in 2055, and debt growing from 100% to 156% of GDP. This surge is driven partly by rising interest payments, which are projected to reach 5.4% of GDP by 2055\u2014surpassing spending on discretionary programs. Social Security costs are also expected to rise due to an aging population.\n\nThe economic outlook shows slowing growth, with real GDP growth expected to fall from 2.1% in 2025 to 1.4% in 2055. A shrinking labor force, exacerbated by reduced immigration, is expected to limit economic output. President Trump's administration is pursuing spending cuts, government workforce reductions, and extending expiring tax cuts, which could add $4.6 trillion to the debt. Trump\u2019s policies on immigration and tariffs may also dampen growth, although their impacts are not factored into the CBO's projections.

This milestone comes only two months after hitting $37 trillion and reflects an accelerated pace of debt accumulation. Key drivers of the rising debt include increased federal spending, particularly on Social Security and Medicare due to an aging population, and significantly higher interest expenses resulting from rising interest rates.\n\nMichael A. Peterson of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation highlighted the alarming speed of debt growth, stressing that interest payments alone could cost the nation $14 trillion over the next decade\u2014up from $4 trillion in the last ten years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that public-held debt will rise from 100% of GDP in 2025 to 120% by 2035, with annual deficits reaching $2.6 trillion by that year. Over the next decade, total federal spending is estimated at $88 trillion, while revenues are projected at $65 trillion, further widening the gap. The situation signals increasing fiscal pressure ahead, especially as interest costs increasingly crowd out other investments.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1761217820.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/2cd7d163780a2a32517ac99efa982ead","title":"US economic growth to slow in the next 30 years, fueled by debt and declining birth rates, CBO says","snippet":"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that U.S. economic growth will slow over the next 30 years due to weak population gains and increasing government spending. According to the CBO\u2019s long-term outlook covering 2025 to 2055, publicly held debt is expected to reach 156% of GDP by 2055, slightly improved from its 2024 forecast but still alarmingly high. Slower birth rates are contributing to this trend, increasing dependence on immigrants to sustain growth, with population decline projected to begin by 2033 without immigration.\n\nThe report assumes current legislation, including the expiration of Trump-era tax cuts, will take effect, though political leaders have indicated plans to extend the cuts and potentially reduce spending. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent challenges the CBO\u2019s methods and promotes a \u201c3-3-3\u201d economic strategy aimed at reducing deficits and boosting productivity through energy production and GDP growth. However, contradictions in Trump-era policies, like potential mass deportations, clash with the need for immigration-fueled labor force growth. The report also underscores the risk of the U.S. hitting its debt ceiling by mid-2025 and warns that proposed fiscal policy changes could worsen the debt outlook despite efforts to spur economic growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1743098407.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696dbdf0a45c83329d2a6caba3f1751f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing for long-term bullish and bearish gold factors","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"4d99e40d-19c9-4267-af82-b66d8203deb0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"306e9463-cbdb-4404-88bb-ec2a641819da","turn_exchange_id":"af8134b0-f024-4271-b016-7f119f256fc6"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"306e9463-cbdb-4404-88bb-ec2a641819da","children":["0a581b09-6ef1-4a30-865e-0c7f270b76ca"]},"0a581b09-6ef1-4a30-865e-0c7f270b76ca":{"id":"0a581b09-6ef1-4a30-865e-0c7f270b76ca","message":{"id":"0a581b09-6ef1-4a30-865e-0c7f270b76ca","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768799733.941486,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for AI macro impacts","content":"I'll search for sources on how AI affects inflation and energy demand to fill in the gaps.

power use to beat record highs in 2026 and 2027, EIA says","snippet":"According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s (EIA) Short-Term Energy Outlook published on January 13, 2026, U.S. power consumption will continue to rise, setting new records in 2026 and 2027. Following a record high of 4,198 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2025, electricity demand is projected to increase to 4,256 billion kWh in 2026 and 4,364 billion kWh in 2027. Key factors driving this growth include the expanding electricity use in homes and businesses, and the surge in power consumption from data centers supporting artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.\n\nResidential, commercial, and industrial electricity sales are also forecast to rise, surpassing previous record levels. Meanwhile, the composition of electricity generation is changing, with the share from natural gas projected to slightly decline from 40% in 2025 to 39% in 2026\u20132027, and coal decreasing from 17% to 15%. In contrast, renewable energy\u2019s share will increase from 24% in 2025 to 28% in 2027, and nuclear energy is expected to fluctuate modestly.\n\nNatural gas consumption patterns are also shifting, with residential, commercial, and industrial use forecast to decline in 2026, while use for power generation is projected to rise to 35.8 billion cubic feet per day.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1768341682.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/pjm-unveils-plan-tackle-ai-driven-power-demand-surge-2026-01-16/","title":"PJM unveils plan to tackle AI-driven power demand surge","snippet":"On January 16, 2026, PJM Interconnection, the operator of the largest U.S. electric grid, unveiled a strategic plan to manage the significant surge in electricity demand driven by the rapid expansion of AI-powered data centers. This action came just hours after the White House urged emergency measures, including a special power auction, to prevent rolling blackouts caused by escalating demand outpacing power generation capacity.\n\nPJM's plan includes requiring new large power users to either supply their own power or agree to early curtailment under a \"connect and manage\" system. The company oversees power across 13 Mid-Atlantic states, including Virginia, home to the world\u2019s largest data center concentration. The proposed framework aims to fast-track power generation, allow load curtailment, improve demand forecasting, expedite state-sponsored generation connections, and launch backup procurement processes to meet near-term reliability needs.\n\nThe PJM Board also intends to file proposals with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and implement some changes immediately while involving stakeholders to address urgent systemic issues. PJM CEO David Mills emphasized the plan balances data center integration with grid reliability and consumer impact.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1768607862.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/global-trade-war-may-produce-headwinds-nascent-ai-sector-iea-says-2025-04-10/","title":"Global trade war may produce headwinds for nascent AI sector, IEA says","snippet":"The International Energy Agency (IEA) warns that a worsening global tariff war could significantly impede the growth of the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and data center sectors. According to IEA Technology Director Laura Cozzi, economic slowdowns and increased tariffs globally may lead to slower AI advancement compared to the agency\u2019s projections. A recent IEA report anticipates that 80% of future data center demand\u2014which is increasingly AI-driven\u2014will come from the U.S., China, and the European Union by 2030. In its optimistic forecast, global data center electricity usage would reach 945 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2030, but in a \"headwind scenario\" influenced by trade tensions, it would only reach 670 TWh.\n\nIn the United States, data centers are projected to drive nearly half of the overall electricity demand growth through 2030. However, utility companies are receiving unprecedented requests for power, sparking concerns that tech firms might be overestimating or inflating demand. Furthermore, around 20% of planned data center projects may face delays due to strains on electricity grids and shortages in critical infrastructure. Additional pressures are emerging from data centers being concentrated within existing clusters, which risks local bottlenecks and further complications.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1744258099.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/meta-sets-up-meta-compute-organization-for-gigawatt-scale-ai-data-centers-initiative-is-said-to-consumer-hundreds-of-gigawatts-over-time","title":"Meta sets up 'Meta Compute' organization for gigawatt-scale AI data centers - initiative is said to consume hundreds of gigawatts over time","snippet":"Meta has launched a new organization called Meta Compute to aggressively expand its computing infrastructure, focusing on building AI data centers capable of consuming tens of gigawatts of power this decade and eventually scaling up to hundreds of gigawatts. The initiative, announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, aims to give Meta a strategic advantage by centralizing responsibility for its system architecture, software stack, developer tools, in-house silicon, worldwide data centers, and supply chains.\n\nMeta Compute will be led by Santosh Janardhan, overseeing technical operations and infrastructure, and Daniel Gross, who will handle long-term capacity planning and supply chain development. This structure is designed to support Meta\u2019s ambitions in AI computing and handle the increasing power demands of advanced AI models. Dina Powell McCormick, recently appointed president and vice chair, will align Meta Compute's multi-billion-dollar investments with company goals and promote regional economic benefits.\n\nDespite spending $72 billion on AI in 2025, Meta\u2019s investments, including its Llama 4 model, have yet to yield major impact, with the company still trailing leaders like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI in the AI sector. Meta Compute aims to change that through long-term infrastructure planning and integrated technical execution.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768257047.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.imf.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/wp/2025/english/wpiea2025076-print-pdf.pdf","title":"The Global Impact of AI: Mind the Gap, WP/25/76, April 2025","snippet":"by E Cerutti \u00b7 2025 \u00b7 Cited by 25 \u2014 Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the promise of raising productivity, stimulating innovation, and altering the nature of work across the globe.1 Nevertheless, ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1744402507.0,"attribution":"www.imf.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity","title":"AI Will Transform the Global Economy.

The report, titled \"The Rise of the Silver Economy,\" highlights opportunities stemming from longer and healthier lifespans. While acknowledging concerns such as slower growth and fiscal strain, the IMF points to increased labor participation, extended working lives, and enhanced productivity as potential benefits of healthier aging trends.\n\nWith global population growth projected to drop to zero by 2100 and the average global age expected to rise by 11 years, the report emphasizes the need for policies that encourage older adults to remain active in the workforce. Suggestions include pension reforms, better training, workplace adaptations, and lifelong learning to ensure employability. A notable finding is that 70-year-olds in 2022 had cognitive abilities similar to 53-year-olds in 2000. The report also explores the possible impact of artificial intelligence on older workers, noting its unresolved potential as either a help or hindrance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1745335146.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theaustralian.com.au","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/health/the-fiscal-crunch-is-coming-from-rising-pension-health-and-aged-care-costs/news-story/8625d65f69374c25ad0c3284b2321c35","title":"Younger workers to carry boomer population bulge","snippet":"Australia is facing significant fiscal and demographic challenges due to an ageing population and declining fertility rates, according to Treasury's 2024 Intergenerational Report and global economic analysis by the IMF. A shrinking workforce and rising costs for health, pensions, and aged care are placing growing strains on younger generations to sustain public services. The old-age dependency ratio is set to rise from 26.6% to 38.2% over the next 40 years, while health spending on those over 85 is projected to surge ninefold. Although Age Pension costs as a share of GDP are expected to decline due to reforms and higher superannuation balances, falling home ownership and longevity risk threaten the retirement income system\u2019s sustainability.\n\nEfforts to address these issues include reforms to superannuation tax breaks and aged-care funding, but structural budget gaps remain. Economists argue for tax system overhauls, such as reducing concessions and broadening the tax base, to raise revenue more equitably. Despite political resistance, experts warn that without lifting productivity, engaging older workers, and updating infrastructure and economic policies, Australia risks a future of persistent deficits and weakened social compacts. A holistic strategy across tax, labor, migration, and infrastructure is essential to navigate the evolving demographic pressures.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1735261200.0,"attribution":"www.theaustralian.com.au"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.barrons.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/imf-global-debt-tariffs-us-china-4e806b56","title":"IMF Says Global Debt Load Crossed $100 Trillion Last Year-and Could Keep Climbing.

The IMF projects that global debt could reach 100% of global GDP by 2030, and under a \"severe\" scenario, could climb to 117% of GDP by 2027\u2014levels comparable to those following World War II. Key factors exacerbating the issue include intensified trade uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and tighter financial conditions. Countries such as the U.S., China, France, Brazil, South Africa, and the U.K. are major contributors to the debt surge.\n\nOne-third of countries, accounting for 80% of global GDP, are experiencing both higher debt levels and faster debt growth compared to pre-pandemic times. The IMF calls for urgent policy changes, warning that rising defense spending and responses to trade disruptions could drive debt higher. In the U.S., the deficit is projected to decrease slightly, but forecasts are clouded by uncertain tariff revenue, especially amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nEmerging markets face heightened risks due to increased borrowing costs linked to U.S. financial volatility and high existing debt levels, which limit their fiscal flexibility.

Despite achieving a soft landing after the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014with inflation receding and global growth projected to slightly dip to 3.2% in 2024 and 2025\u2014the IMF emphasizes concern over weak long-term prospects. US growth is expected to remain strong at 2.8% in 2024, but Europe's growth is weaker, particularly in manufacturing-heavy countries like Germany. China's weakening growth, largely due to real estate sector woes, and rising global protectionism further exacerbate the global slowdown.\n\nStructural challenges such as aging populations, falling productivity, and low investment also hinder progress. Public debt is expected to climb to 100% of global GDP by 2030, driven by increased spending needs related to demographics, green energy, and defense. This rising debt limits nations' ability to manage other priorities like education and infrastructure. The global downturn threatens efforts to fight climate change and may halt progress in reducing poverty, with the World Bank projecting a decades-long delay in meeting poverty-reduction goals.

escalating global tensions and robust investor interest. Silver also surged to a record $86.22/oz, marking a strong continuation of 2025\u2019s rally. Gold has already climbed over 6% this year after gaining 64% in 2025. Key drivers include geopolitical instability\u2014such as U.S. political turmoil, international conflicts, and threats of intervention\u2014alongside expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, making precious metals more attractive.\n\nCentral banks have maintained strong gold demand, notably China, which increased its holdings for the 14th consecutive month. Meanwhile, gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw unprecedented inflows of $89 billion in 2025, with SPDR Gold Trust holdings hitting multi-year highs.\n\nSilver, with a 147% rise last year, is also benefitting from investment demand and market imbalances. Analysts predict silver could reach or exceed $90/oz, with some forecasting a potential peak above $100 due to its heightened sensitivity to market conditions. However, experts like HSBC caution that easing supply constraints later in 2026 could drive a market correction.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1768306134.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/how-investors-buy-gold-what-fuels-market-2026-01-12/","title":"How investors buy gold and what fuels the market","snippet":"As of January 2026, gold prices have reached a historic high of over $4,600 per ounce, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions and expectations of more accommodating U.S. monetary policies.

This is a real-time market where prices are based on immediate supply and demand.\n   \n2. **Futures Market**: Investors trade contracts to buy or sell gold at a set future date and price. Major exchanges include COMEX (U.S.), Shanghai Futures Exchange (China), and TOCOM (Japan).\n\n3. **Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs/ETFs)**: These securities are backed by physical gold and saw record inflows of $89 billion in 2025, especially from North America.\n\n4. **Physical Gold (Bars and Coins)**: Accessible to retail investors via shops or online dealers.\n\nGold price movements are influenced by investor sentiment, foreign exchange rates (particularly the U.S. dollar), geopolitical tensions, central bank policies, and gold reserve purchases.

Spot gold prices surged 27%\u2014the highest annual rise since 2010\u2014driven by geopolitical tensions, U.S. interest rate cuts, and safe-haven buying amid economic uncertainty. Notably, central banks, led by the National Bank of Poland adding 90 tons, bought over 1,000 tons of gold for the third consecutive year, with purchases accelerating by 54% year-on-year in Q4 following Donald Trump's U.S. election win.\n\nInvestment demand jumped 25% to a four-year high of 1,180 tons, as ETF outflows halted and bar purchases rose 10%, although coin buying fell 31%. Demand excluding OTC trading reached 4,553.7 tons, also up 1%, while OTC demand slid 7% due to year-end profit-taking. Gold jewelry consumption declined by 11%, while mine production remained stable and recycling increased 15%. The WGC forecasts continued strong central bank demand in 2025, along with support from economic and geopolitical instability. Jewelry demand is expected to stay subdued, with elevated prices likely boosting recycling further.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1738736298.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"m.economictimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://m.economictimes.com/mf/mf-news/gold-etf-inflows-hit-usd-88-5-billion-worldwide-nippon-india-gold-bees-ranks-15th/articleshow/126480848.cms","title":"Gold ETF inflows hit USD 88.5 billion worldwide; Nippon India Gold BeES ranks 15th","snippet":"In 2025, global gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) experienced strong net inflows totaling USD 88.5 billion, indicating gold's continued importance as a portfolio diversifier.

Gold tends to do better when real yields are low because holding gold is less costly versus holding real yield\u2013producing assets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- **Trust/credibility risk premia:** fear of currency debasement, fiscal/monetary regime stress, geopolitical fracture, sanctions risk.\n- **Official-sector demand:** central banks treating gold as **neutral reserve collateral** (no counterparty risk).\n\nThose three \u201cstate variables\u201d are what you want to map your ideas onto.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Secular forces that are plausibly bullish for gold (10\u201325 years)\n\n### A) Fiscal arithmetic: persistent deficits + debt compounding risk\nThe U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline projects **persistently large deficits** over decades and **public debt rising materially** (Reuters summarises CBO\u2019s 2025\u20132055 outlook as debt rising from ~100% of gross domestic product to ~156% by 2055, with deficits rising as a share of gross domestic product). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \nWhy this matters for gold long-run:\n\n- **More debt + higher interest costs** increases the probability of some mix of: inflation tolerance, financial repression (policy that keeps real returns on government debt low), or episodic confidence shocks in sovereign debt markets.\n- Even if outright default is unlikely for a reserve issuer, \u201csoft default\u201d via inflation or yield suppression is the kind of regime gold historically likes.\n\n**Key nuance for your rates concern:** high nominal rates can *accelerate* fiscal stress; that can be gold-bullish if it pushes policy toward repression/monetisation rather than \u201cVolcker-style\u201d discipline.\n\n---\n\n### B) Gradual reserve diversification away from USD\nThe U.S. dollar still dominates reserves, but the share has **declined over decades**: the Federal Reserve notes the dollar comprised about **58% of disclosed global reserves in 2024**, down from a peak around **72% in 2001**, with diversification into a broader set of currencies. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search16\ue202turn3search0\ue201  \nIf this long drift continues, gold can benefit as a \u201creserve diversifier of last resort,\u201d especially for countries that don\u2019t fully trust any single bloc\u2019s assets.\n\n**Critique of a common overstatement:** \u201cde-dollarisation\u201d is real but slow; the data so far looks more like *diversification* than sudden dollar abandonment. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search16\ue202turn3search0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### C) Sanctions/asset-freeze risk and a more fragmented geopolitical order\nA major post-2022 structural change is that many reserve managers now price in **sanctions and asset-freeze risk**. World Gold Council research explicitly highlights multi-year **>1,000 tonnes/year central bank accumulation** and links it to heightened geopolitical/economic uncertainty. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \nThis creates a durable bid for an asset that is *nobody else\u2019s liability*.\n\n---\n\n### D) Higher inflation volatility (even if average inflation isn\u2019t huge)\nGold doesn\u2019t need permanently high inflation; it can thrive on **inflation uncertainty** and repeated supply shocks. The International Monetary Fund and others have warned that protectionism/geoeconomic fragmentation and shocks can keep downside risks elevated and complicate disinflation. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn0search42\ue201  \nIf the world lives in a regime of recurring shocks (energy, conflict, supply chains, climate events), gold\u2019s \u201cinsurance premium\u201d can stay structurally higher.\n\n---\n\n### E) Demographics as a fiscal (and political) driver\nAgeing tends to raise fiscal pressures (pensions/health/long-term care).

Key drivers include geopolitical instability\u2014such as U.S. political turmoil, international conflicts, and threats of intervention\u2014alongside expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, making precious metals more attractive.\n\nCentral banks have maintained strong gold demand, notably China, which increased its holdings for the 14th consecutive month. Meanwhile, gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw unprecedented inflows of $89 billion in 2025, with SPDR Gold Trust holdings hitting multi-year highs.\n\nSilver, with a 147% rise last year, is also benefitting from investment demand and market imbalances. Analysts predict silver could reach or exceed $90/oz, with some forecasting a potential peak above $100 due to its heightened sensitivity to market conditions. However, experts like HSBC caution that easing supply constraints later in 2026 could drive a market correction.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":6140,"end_idx":6174,"safe_urls":["https://www.chicagofed.org/-/media/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2021/cfl464-pdf.pdf","https://www.chicagofed.org/-/media/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2021/cfl464-pdf.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.pimco.com/sg/en/resources/education/understanding-gold-prices","https://www.pimco.com/sg/en/resources/education/understanding-gold-prices?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago](https://www.chicagofed.org/-/media/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2021/cfl464-pdf.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"What drives gold prices?;","url":"https://www.chicagofed.org/-/media/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2021/cfl464-pdf.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1636400765.0,"snippet":"by RB Barsky \u00b7 Cited by 11 \u2014 Gold is sensitive to expected long-term real interest rates.

This surge is driven partly by rising interest payments, which are projected to reach 5.4% of GDP by 2055\u2014surpassing spending on discretionary programs. Social Security costs are also expected to rise due to an aging population.\n\nThe economic outlook shows slowing growth, with real GDP growth expected to fall from 2.1% in 2025 to 1.4% in 2055. A shrinking labor force, exacerbated by reduced immigration, is expected to limit economic output. President Trump's administration is pursuing spending cuts, government workforce reductions, and extending expiring tax cuts, which could add $4.6 trillion to the debt. Trump\u2019s policies on immigration and tariffs may also dampen growth, although their impacts are not factored into the CBO's projections.

The rally stems from heightened investor interest in safe-haven assets amid renewed U.S.-China tariff tensions reignited by President Donald Trump, alongside increased expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts. Despite acknowledging a potential short-term correction, Bank of America maintains a bullish long-term outlook.

Despite a 15% decline in gold output to 1.42 million ounces, impacted by lower ore grades and maintenance activities at key mines, the company benefited from improved all-in sustaining costs, which fell 2.8% to $1,566 per ounce. However, Newmont cautioned that its free cash flow for the fourth quarter would be adversely affected by increased spending on projects like water treatment facilities at Yanacocha and severance payments. The company's shares dropped 2% in after-hours trading due to these concerns and warnings about weaker future cash flows, especially disheartening given the strong gold market. Furthermore, Newmont anticipates its 2026 gold production will be at the lower end of its 2025 forecast.

A Reuters poll of 39 experts sees gold averaging $4,275 next year, up significantly from July's forecast of $3,400. For 2025, the average is projected at $3,400, also revised upward. Gold has surged over 50% this year due to factors like inflation fears, economic instability, a weaker US dollar, President Trump's tariffs, high interest rates, and a government shutdown. The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cuts have further boosted gold's appeal as a non-yielding safe-haven asset.\n\nAnalysts believe the ongoing rally reflects deeper concerns about global financial systems and loss of confidence in policymakers. Silver has also experienced a huge rise, up 65% this year, hitting a record $54.47 per ounce, largely due to supply deficits and increasing industrial demand from sectors like solar technology, electric vehicles, and AI data centers.

From October to December, gold prices reached record highs amid uncertainty from the U.S. presidential election and Middle East tensions, supporting demand for the safe-haven asset. Newmont reported a 9.2% year-over-year increase in gold production to 1.90 million ounces, with the average gold price surging 31.9% to $2,643 per ounce. Additionally, its all-in-sustaining-costs declined 1.5% to $1,463 per ounce, boosting profitability. The company expects to produce about 5.9 million ounces of gold in the current year, surpassing Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 5.87 million. Following its $17.14 billion acquisition of Newcrest in 2024, Newmont has undertaken asset divestitures and workforce reductions to lower its $5.31 billion debt. Recent sales include the Eleonore mine for $795 million, the Musselwhite Gold Mine for $850 million, and its stake in Porcupine Operations for $425 million.

The company's average realized gold price rose significantly to $3,457 per ounce in Q3 2025 from $2,494 a year earlier, benefiting from increased demand due to global uncertainties, such as U.S. tariff policies and geopolitical tensions. Gold prices averaged $3,574.95 per ounce in the quarter, up over 43% year-over-year. However, Barrick\u2019s production fell to 829,000 ounces from 943,000 ounces, partly due to a conflict with Mali\u2019s government, which included a suspension of operations, export blocks, and the seizure of bullion. Amid rising costs, with all-in sustaining costs increasing to $1,538 per ounce, Barrick still managed to exceed profit expectations, earning 58 cents per share versus the expected 57 cents. In response, the company raised its dividend by 25% to 125 cents per share and expanded its share buyback program by $500 million. U.S.-listed shares rose nearly 4% in premarket trading following the announcement.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1762774676.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/gold-miner-newmont-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2025-10-23/","title":"Newmont beats quarterly profit estimates, warns of lower cash flow ahead","snippet":"Newmont, the world's largest gold miner, reported third-quarter profits surpassing expectations, driven by record-high gold prices averaging $3,539 per ounce\u2014a significant jump from $2,518 a year prior. Despite a 15% decline in gold output to 1.42 million ounces, impacted by lower ore grades and maintenance activities at key mines, the company benefited from improved all-in sustaining costs, which fell 2.8% to $1,566 per ounce. However, Newmont cautioned that its free cash flow for the fourth quarter would be adversely affected by increased spending on projects like water treatment facilities at Yanacocha and severance payments. The company's shares dropped 2% in after-hours trading due to these concerns and warnings about weaker future cash flows, especially disheartening given the strong gold market. Furthermore, Newmont anticipates its 2026 gold production will be at the lower end of its 2025 forecast.

The company's shares rose 2% in after-hours trading following the results. Gold prices hit record highs between January and March due to fears of a global trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff policies, leading investors to seek safety in gold. Newmont reported a 41% increase in its average realized gold price to $2,944 per ounce, even as gold production fell 8.3% to 1.54 million ounces due to lower output from non-core operations.\n\nTo manage its debt of $3.22 billion, Newmont has been divesting non-core assets, following its $17.14 billion acquisition of Newcrest in 2023. Recently, it agreed to sell the Eleonore mine and Musselwhite Gold Mine in Canada for a combined value of over $1.6 billion, and its stake in the Porcupine Operations for $425 million. However, the company's all-in sustaining costs rose nearly 15% to $1,651 per ounce due to the reduced production.

Previously forecast to produce 94,000\u2013104,000 ounces this year, the site is now expected to yield only 35,000\u201345,000 ounces. Consequently, the firm's full-year gold-equivalent production guidance was reduced to 291,000\u2013319,000 ounces, from 350,000\u2013378,000 ounces. This decline has also led to a rise in cost expectations, with all-in sustaining costs projected to increase to $1,980\u2013$2,080 per ounce, up from the earlier $1,587\u2013$1,687 range.\n\nThe revised guidance follows earlier disruptions at Mara Rosa, including a temporary suspension in June for maintenance and repairs. Performance at the processing plant is reportedly improving, but operations will run below capacity until at least early 2026. Despite the challenges, Hochschild reported strong financial results for the first half of the year: pretax profit rose to $140.1 million, revenue surged 33% to $520 million, and adjusted EBITDA climbed 27% to $224.5 million.

Silver also hit a new high of $69.44 an ounce, outperforming gold due to industrial demand and constrained supply. Mining stocks saw significant gains, with Mexico's Fresnillo rising 2.8% on the FTSE 100 and achieving a 440% increase year-to-date, while Endeavour Mining gained 1.94%, totaling 180% for the year. Other precious metals like platinum and palladium also advanced, while copper hit a record $11,996 per metric ton on the London Metal Exchange amid possible Chinese supply disruptions.

The company's average realized gold price rose significantly to $3,457 per ounce in Q3 2025 from $2,494 a year earlier, benefiting from increased demand due to global uncertainties, such as U.S. tariff policies and geopolitical tensions. Gold prices averaged $3,574.95 per ounce in the quarter, up over 43% year-over-year. However, Barrick\u2019s production fell to 829,000 ounces from 943,000 ounces, partly due to a conflict with Mali\u2019s government, which included a suspension of operations, export blocks, and the seizure of bullion. Amid rising costs, with all-in sustaining costs increasing to $1,538 per ounce, Barrick still managed to exceed profit expectations, earning 58 cents per share versus the expected 57 cents. In response, the company raised its dividend by 25% to 125 cents per share and expanded its share buyback program by $500 million. U.S.-listed shares rose nearly 4% in premarket trading following the announcement.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Newmont beats quarterly profit estimates, warns of lower cash flow ahead","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/gold-miner-newmont-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2025-10-23/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Newmont, the world's largest gold miner, reported third-quarter profits surpassing expectations, driven by record-high gold prices averaging $3,539 per ounce\u2014a significant jump from $2,518 a year prior.

This is a real-time market where prices are based on immediate supply and demand.\n   \n2. **Futures Market**: Investors trade contracts to buy or sell gold at a set future date and price. Major exchanges include COMEX (U.S.), Shanghai Futures Exchange (China), and TOCOM (Japan).\n\n3. **Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs/ETFs)**: These securities are backed by physical gold and saw record inflows of $89 billion in 2025, especially from North America.\n\n4. **Physical Gold (Bars and Coins)**: Accessible to retail investors via shops or online dealers.\n\nGold price movements are influenced by investor sentiment, foreign exchange rates (particularly the U.S. dollar), geopolitical tensions, central bank policies, and gold reserve purchases. Growing demand from central banks, notably China, has also supported prices amid global economic uncertainty.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768211146.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-demand-up-1-2024-remain-supported-by-economic-uncertainty-world-gold-2025-02-05/","title":"Gold demand up 1% in 2024, to remain supported by economic uncertainty, World Gold Council says","snippet":"Global gold demand rose by 1% to a record 4,974.5 metric tons in 2024, bolstered by increased investment and strong central bank purchases, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). Spot gold prices surged 27%\u2014the highest annual rise since 2010\u2014driven by geopolitical tensions, U.S. interest rate cuts, and safe-haven buying amid economic uncertainty. Notably, central banks, led by the National Bank of Poland adding 90 tons, bought over 1,000 tons of gold for the third consecutive year, with purchases accelerating by 54% year-on-year in Q4 following Donald Trump's U.S. election win.\n\nInvestment demand jumped 25% to a four-year high of 1,180 tons, as ETF outflows halted and bar purchases rose 10%, although coin buying fell 31%. Demand excluding OTC trading reached 4,553.7 tons, also up 1%, while OTC demand slid 7% due to year-end profit-taking. Gold jewelry consumption declined by 11%, while mine production remained stable and recycling increased 15%. The WGC forecasts continued strong central bank demand in 2025, along with support from economic and geopolitical instability.

Total official-sector gold purchases reached 1,044.6 metric tons, slightly lower than 2023 but maintaining a trend of over 1,000 metric tons annually for the third year in a row\u2014significantly higher than the 2010\u20132021 yearly average of 473 metric tons. Total global gold demand also climbed to a record 4,974.5 metric tons, driven by a 25% year-over-year surge in investment demand, which hit a four-year high of 1,179.5 metric tons.\n\nThe outlook for 2025 suggests continued strong demand, with geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty\u2014including U.S. policy changes under the Trump administration\u2014seen as key factors. New U.S. tariffs on China, and retaliatory measures, may increase inflation and bolster gold\u2019s appeal as a hedge. Central banks and ETF investors are expected to remain pivotal drivers of gold demand. Gold prices have responded accordingly, with April futures recently settling at a record $2,875.80 per ounce. Despite unpredictability in individual bank strategies, global instability continues to make gold an attractive strategic asset.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1738748820.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"economictimes.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/global-central-bank-gold-reserves-rise-to-32000-tonnes-in-2024/articleshow/121025304.cms","title":"Global central bank gold reserves rise to 32,000 tonnes in 2024","snippet":"As of 2024, global central bank gold reserves have risen to 32,000 tonnes, marking a significant increase from 26,000 tonnes in 2009.

This surge follows a prolonged recovery since M2 bottomed out in April 2023, when it experienced a record 4.63% decline. January represents the 11th straight month of year-over-year increases in M2, which now stands at $21.56 trillion\u2014$6.1 trillion above pre-pandemic levels. While the increase in money supply suggests ample liquidity for consumer spending and potential market rallies, it also complicates the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing inflation back to its 2% target. Chairman Jerome Powell has previously downplayed M2\u2019s relevance for economic growth, but other economists argue it remains a valuable economic signal. The exact causes behind the recent jump in M2 are unclear, but increased bank lending and the Fed\u2019s recent interest rate reductions may have played a role.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1740514560.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/imf-global-debt-tariffs-us-china-4e806b56","title":"IMF Says Global Debt Load Crossed $100 Trillion Last Year-and Could Keep Climbing. What's at Stake.","snippet":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised alarms over the surging global debt, which surpassed $100 trillion in 2024. The IMF projects that global debt could reach 100% of global GDP by 2030, and under a \"severe\" scenario, could climb to 117% of GDP by 2027\u2014levels comparable to those following World War II. Key factors exacerbating the issue include intensified trade uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and tighter financial conditions. Countries such as the U.S., China, France, Brazil, South Africa, and the U.K. are major contributors to the debt surge.\n\nOne-third of countries, accounting for 80% of global GDP, are experiencing both higher debt levels and faster debt growth compared to pre-pandemic times. The IMF calls for urgent policy changes, warning that rising defense spending and responses to trade disruptions could drive debt higher. In the U.S., the deficit is projected to decrease slightly, but forecasts are clouded by uncertain tariff revenue, especially amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nEmerging markets face heightened risks due to increased borrowing costs linked to U.S. financial volatility and high existing debt levels, which limit their fiscal flexibility. The IMF urges countries to act now to build economic resilience.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1745423760.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/oct/14/us-treasury-secretary-beijing-rare-earths-us-china-port-fees-imf-tariffs-business-live-news","title":"UK economy at risk of 'bumpy landing'; JP Morgan's Dimon warns of 'more cockroaches' after collapse of First Brands and Tricolor - as it happened","snippet":"The global economic landscape is grappling with heightened risks amid escalating US-China trade tensions and financial market vulnerabilities. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized China for constraining rare earth exports, accusing it of attempting to destabilize the global economy. In retaliation, both nations implemented tit-for-tat port fees on shipping firms, exacerbating fears of a trade war. China signaled readiness for talks but emphasized readiness to retaliate if provoked. The IMF warned of a fragile global economic outlook, predicting slowing growth, rising inflation\u2014particularly in the UK\u2014and a looming sharp correction in overvalued US tech stocks dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nIn the UK, Bank of England policymaker Alan Taylor warned of a \"bumpy landing,\" citing risks of inflation undershooting and rising unemployment. The IMF urged the Bank to proceed cautiously with interest rate cuts due to persistent inflation risks. Meanwhile, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon flagged concerns about rising credit risk in the private sector following collapses of Tricolor and First Brands. Despite strong earnings from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, broader markets are rattled by geopolitical and economic uncertainties. Silver prices soared due to haven demand, and General Motors reported a $1.6 billion charge related to weaker EV adoption.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1760454439.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/a92ec981-8a89-4caf-878d-6278186c9e31","title":"IMF upgrades global growth forecast as weaker dollar aids world economy","snippet":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its global growth forecast, projecting 3% growth in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, up from April's estimates of 2.8% and 3% respectively. This revision reflects expectations that Donald Trump's trade war will have a less severe impact than initially feared. A key factor supporting global growth is the weakening US dollar, which has fallen about 9% this year, easing financial conditions worldwide and reducing debt burdens in emerging markets. The US and China both received growth upgrades, with the US now expected to grow by 1.9% in 2025 and China by 4.8%. The UK is forecasted to be the third fastest-growing G7 country this year. Despite the upgrade, the IMF warned that growth remains below pre-pandemic levels and emphasized unresolved uncertainties, including the effectiveness of new trade deals and the impact of stockpiled goods. The report also stressed the importance of central bank independence, criticizing potential political interference in monetary policy, particularly in the US under President Trump, which could undermine price stability and long-term economic resilience.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1753794095.674,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696dc46b78e88331854a39c3987bdb43","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for authoritative global M2 money supply estimates","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"93be27e5-495d-43dd-8a65-15a1a0ca037d","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"5f625740-b3ce-4a8a-b260-1387555f8080","turn_exchange_id":"e9b008cb-82a2-4205-ad80-6f321976a548"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5f625740-b3ce-4a8a-b260-1387555f8080","children":["41f1d419-2671-4bf9-ae2c-9ea9447d1b5b"]},"41f1d419-2671-4bf9-ae2c-9ea9447d1b5b":{"id":"41f1d419-2671-4bf9-ae2c-9ea9447d1b5b","message":{"id":"41f1d419-2671-4bf9-ae2c-9ea9447d1b5b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768801423.726222,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Constructing estimate for global money supply","content":"I\u2019ve found estimates from StreetStats, WisdomTree, and Voronoi/Econovis for global money supply, ranging from $97.8T to $160T, depending on the countries included.

This act establishes a comprehensive federal and state regulatory framework for stablecoins, requiring full reserves, audits, and strict compliance to prevent fraud. The act enables banks, fintech firms, and major retailers to adopt stablecoin technologies, which promise near-instantaneous settlements, reduced transaction costs, and innovation in cross-border payments and digital commerce.\n\nMajor institutions such as JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Visa, Mastercard, and retailers like Amazon and Walmart are exploring or implementing stablecoin strategies. Mastercard and Visa highlight stablecoin roles in emerging markets and remittances, while banks eye faster capital flow and reduced lag. Coinbase and Fiserv are also entering the space, enabling stablecoin spending and supporting regional banks.\n\nThe article also covers the broader crypto legislative landscape, including the Clarity Act, which aims to define regulatory authority over various digital assets. Stablecoins are positioned as tools for financial efficiency rather than speculation, potentially reshaping personal finance, banking, and global payments. Market optimism persists despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Bitcoin recently surged near $124,500 amid favorable policy shifts, though volatility remains.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1757100060.0,"attribution":"www.investors.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-currency-trading-closing-10-trillion-day-2025-09-30/","title":"Global currency trading closing in on $10 trillion a day","snippet":"Global currency trading reached a record high of $9.6 trillion per day in April 2025, according to a triennial survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The surge, a 28% increase from April 2022, was driven by heightened market volatility following U.S. trade tariffs under Donald Trump\u2019s 'Liberation Day' policy. Despite speculation about the dollar's reserve status and a decline in its value, it continued to dominate trading due to increased use of forward contracts to hedge U.S. exposures.\n\nThe survey also highlighted the yuan\u2019s growing prominence in global FX markets, rising to 8.5% of trading volume, while sterling's market share fell sharply to 10.2%, raising doubts about its reserve currency status. The euro\u2019s share fell to just under 29%. Trading activity remained concentrated, with Britain, the U.S., Singapore, and Hong Kong accounting for 75% of activity. Additionally, over-the-counter interest rate derivatives trading jumped 59% to $7.9 trillion, with a noticeable shift toward euro and yen-denominated contracts, reflecting changing interest rate policies, particularly in Japan.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1759240707.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stablecoin-supply-is-growing-fast-heres-how-it-compares-to-cash-66f12bc1","title":"Stablecoin supply is growing fast.

As of May 2025, the total supply of stablecoins reached $247 billion\u2014up nearly 54% from the previous year\u2014compared to $2.4 trillion in physical U.S. currency, per the Federal Reserve. While stablecoins are not considered physical currency, Coinbase and others note their growing use as a potential alternative to cash and traditional payments due to advantages like faster settlement and lower fees, especially for cross-border transactions.\n\nCurrently, about 88% of stablecoin transaction value stems from crypto trading, with only 6% used for payments. Despite concerns over their misuse in illicit activities, such as money laundering and ransomware, regulatory interest is intensifying. The U.S. Senate is advancing the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate the stablecoin sector for the first time. If passed, it could support mainstream adoption.

Global GDP growth for 2025 is now projected at 2.8%, down from 3.3% just three months prior. The U.S., a key driver of the slowdown, saw its forecast slashed from 2.7% to 1.8%, while the UK was downgraded from 1.6% to 1.1%, though it remains the fastest-growing European G7 country. The IMF cited increased tariff-related uncertainty and deteriorating global financial stability, warning of rising risks of a U.S. recession and inflation.\n\nMarkets responded with a slump in U.S. asset values, a plunging dollar (hitting a three-year low), and surging gold, which reached a record $3,500 per ounce. The IMF also highlighted investor concerns over the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence following Trump\u2019s criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Financial stability risks have increased, with tightening global conditions and volatility in equity and bond markets threatening further disruption. The IMF urged constructive international cooperation on trade and debt restructuring to mitigate ongoing economic turmoil.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1745336631.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cash-is-still-king-total-currency-in-circulation-at-rs-38-1-lakh-crore-grows-2-4/articleshow/121207576.cms","title":"Cash is still king!

What They're Buying Instead.","snippet":"Central banks around the world are gradually reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar in favor of a more diversified reserve composition, according to a new report by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF). Based on confidential interviews with 10 central banks managing $6.5 trillion in reserves\u2014including banks from Germany, Poland, Spain, Italy, Korea, and multiple African and Latin American countries\u2014the report reveals a strategic pivot towards the euro, Chinese yuan, and gold. The shift reflects weakening trust in U.S. policy and the dollar's decreasing share of global reserves, which fell to 56.32% in mid-2025 from 59% earlier in the year.\n\nDespite the dollar's dominance in global finance, reserve managers express increasing interest in assets like gold, which is seen as a symbol of independence, and in shorter-duration bonds for greater liquidity during market stress. While alternatives like the euro and yuan are gaining ground, limitations such as the lack of a unified European Treasury market hinder their potential to fully replace the dollar. The move away from the dollar is described as a transition to a more balanced, multipolar reserve system rather than a wholesale shift to a single new anchor currency.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52},"pub_date":1764162000.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696dc71250dc832a9a7c86f25f6fc2e7","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching global narrow money supply estimates for 2025","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"a1843a55-8458-4217-b706-bf795c446235","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c2bb3c43-b29a-4559-adf9-313152092baf","turn_exchange_id":"66f4b738-89eb-4f1d-ac0a-eb62a84b1a39"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c2bb3c43-b29a-4559-adf9-313152092baf","children":["80320b4d-d78e-43a7-beff-4c7a827680bc"]},"80320b4d-d78e-43a7-beff-4c7a827680bc":{"id":"80320b4d-d78e-43a7-beff-4c7a827680bc","message":{"id":"80320b4d-d78e-43a7-beff-4c7a827680bc","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768802075.821811,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for reputable sources for conservative money supply estimate","content":"To meet the \"conservative\" request, I\u2019ll focus on M0 or M1, perhaps global currency in circulation.

The surge, a 28% increase from April 2022, was driven by heightened market volatility following U.S. trade tariffs under Donald Trump\u2019s 'Liberation Day' policy. Despite speculation about the dollar's reserve status and a decline in its value, it continued to dominate trading due to increased use of forward contracts to hedge U.S. exposures.\n\nThe survey also highlighted the yuan\u2019s growing prominence in global FX markets, rising to 8.5% of trading volume, while sterling's market share fell sharply to 10.2%, raising doubts about its reserve currency status. The euro\u2019s share fell to just under 29%. Trading activity remained concentrated, with Britain, the U.S., Singapore, and Hong Kong accounting for 75% of activity. Additionally, over-the-counter interest rate derivatives trading jumped 59% to $7.9 trillion, with a noticeable shift toward euro and yen-denominated contracts, reflecting changing interest rate policies, particularly in Japan.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":55},"pub_date":1759240707.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/percent-global-fx-reserves-dollars-ticks-up-amounts-fall-imf-data-shows-2025-03-31/","title":"Percent of global FX reserves in dollars ticks up, amounts fall, IMF data shows","snippet":"At the end of 2024, global foreign exchange reserves decreased to $12.36 trillion from $12.75 trillion in the prior quarter, according to IMF's COFER data. Disaggregated reserves that disclose individual currencies fell to $11.47 trillion from $11.84 trillion. Despite this decline in absolute dollar amounts held, the percentage of reserves denominated in U.S. dollars rose slightly to 57.8% from 57.3%, driven by a 7.7% appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which diminished the dollar value of non-dollar holdings. Among other currencies, only the Canadian dollar (\"loonie\") showed a small increase in percentage share, rising to 2.77% from 2.74%. The euro\u2019s share dropped to 19.8% from 20.0%, the pound sterling to 4.73% from 4.98%, while the Chinese yuan stayed at 2.18% and the yen held nearly steady at 5.82%.

Coin usage has risen by 3.6% in volume, with Rs 1, 2, and 5 coins most common. The RBI\u2019s digital currency (e\u20b9) saw a 334% surge in value, predominantly in the Rs 500 denomination. Although counterfeit Rs 10, 20, and 2000 notes have decreased, fake Rs 200 and Rs 500 notes have increased. Note printing costs have risen to Rs 6,372.8 crore. The RBI is also promoting eco-friendly disposal of old notes by recycling them into furniture. Additionally, it launched the \u2018Sa-Mudra\u2019 project for modernizing and digitizing currency handling. These steps indicate a strategic shift toward digitalization, cost-efficiency, and sustainability in currency management.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":62},"pub_date":1748511100.0,"attribution":"indiatimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/currency-update-rs-2000-notes-worth-rs-5817-crore-still-in-circulation-rbi-says-98-37-of-high-value-bills-returned/articleshow/125015931.cms","title":"Currency update: Rs 2,000 notes worth Rs 5,817 crore still in circulation; RBI says 98.37% of high-value bills returned","snippet":"As of November 1, 2025, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reported that \u20b92,000 denomination notes worth \u20b95,817 crore are still in circulation.

As of May 2025, the total supply of stablecoins reached $247 billion\u2014up nearly 54% from the previous year\u2014compared to $2.4 trillion in physical U.S. currency, per the Federal Reserve. While stablecoins are not considered physical currency, Coinbase and others note their growing use as a potential alternative to cash and traditional payments due to advantages like faster settlement and lower fees, especially for cross-border transactions.\n\nCurrently, about 88% of stablecoin transaction value stems from crypto trading, with only 6% used for payments. Despite concerns over their misuse in illicit activities, such as money laundering and ransomware, regulatory interest is intensifying. The U.S. Senate is advancing the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate the stablecoin sector for the first time. If passed, it could support mainstream adoption.

This is a real-time market where prices are based on immediate supply and demand.\n   \n2. **Futures Market**: Investors trade contracts to buy or sell gold at a set future date and price. Major exchanges include COMEX (U.S.), Shanghai Futures Exchange (China), and TOCOM (Japan).\n\n3. **Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs/ETFs)**: These securities are backed by physical gold and saw record inflows of $89 billion in 2025, especially from North America.\n\n4. **Physical Gold (Bars and Coins)**: Accessible to retail investors via shops or online dealers.\n\nGold price movements are influenced by investor sentiment, foreign exchange rates (particularly the U.S. dollar), geopolitical tensions, central bank policies, and gold reserve purchases.

Spot gold prices surged 27%\u2014the highest annual rise since 2010\u2014driven by geopolitical tensions, U.S. interest rate cuts, and safe-haven buying amid economic uncertainty. Notably, central banks, led by the National Bank of Poland adding 90 tons, bought over 1,000 tons of gold for the third consecutive year, with purchases accelerating by 54% year-on-year in Q4 following Donald Trump's U.S. election win.\n\nInvestment demand jumped 25% to a four-year high of 1,180 tons, as ETF outflows halted and bar purchases rose 10%, although coin buying fell 31%. Demand excluding OTC trading reached 4,553.7 tons, also up 1%, while OTC demand slid 7% due to year-end profit-taking. Gold jewelry consumption declined by 11%, while mine production remained stable and recycling increased 15%.

Analysts point to safe-haven demand amid inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, particularly relating to U.S. tariffs under President Trump. Oil prices also climbed due to conflict in the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, Thames Water announced it had received six takeover offers, with hopes to finalize a deal by June. The UK Competition and Markets Authority is reviewing several water companies\u2019 appeals to increase customer bills further. Centrica\u2019s CEO saw his pay nearly halve due to a reduced bonus, while Reach executives faced criticism for sizable bonuses amid staff discontent over modest raises.\n\nIn Germany, the Bundestag passed legislation allowing increased borrowing, signaling a historic fiscal shift. ANZ raised its gold forecasts, Google parent Alphabet reportedly acquired cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion, and fund managers made a significant shift away from U.S. equities due to recession and trade war concerns.\n\nAdditionally, South Yorkshire announced a move to public transport control, construction insolvencies remained high, and Lloyds Bank prepared for an IT reshuffle that may result in job losses.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1742311760.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"economictimes.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/global-central-bank-gold-reserves-rise-to-32000-tonnes-in-2024/articleshow/121025304.cms","title":"Global central bank gold reserves rise to 32,000 tonnes in 2024","snippet":"As of 2024, global central bank gold reserves have risen to 32,000 tonnes, marking a significant increase from 26,000 tonnes in 2009.

Total global gold demand also climbed to a record 4,974.5 metric tons, driven by a 25% year-over-year surge in investment demand, which hit a four-year high of 1,179.5 metric tons.\n\nThe outlook for 2025 suggests continued strong demand, with geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty\u2014including U.S. policy changes under the Trump administration\u2014seen as key factors. New U.S. tariffs on China, and retaliatory measures, may increase inflation and bolster gold\u2019s appeal as a hedge. Central banks and ETF investors are expected to remain pivotal drivers of gold demand. Gold prices have responded accordingly, with April futures recently settling at a record $2,875.80 per ounce.

Valuable to collectors, it often sells for multiples of its face value.\n\n3. **$1,000 Bill** \u2013 Initially depicted Hamilton, later Grover Cleveland; discontinued due to low use and inflation. Like the $500 bill, it's still legal tender and prized by collectors.\n\n4. **$5,000 Bill** \u2013 Showcased James Madison and was mainly used for interbank transactions. Discontinued in 1969, it is extremely rare today.\n\n5. **$10,000 Bill** \u2013 Featured Salmon P. Chase; the highest denomination printed for public use. Due to limited circulation, surviving notes are exceedingly rare.\n\n6. **$100,000 Bill** \u2013 A gold certificate featuring Woodrow Wilson, created in 1934 for Federal Reserve transactions only, and never circulated publicly.\n\nThe article also notes the discontinuation of certain coins and the rarity of bills like the $2 note.

The Rs 2000 notes are already being phased out, with 98.2% returned to banks by March 2025. Rs 500 notes now dominate the market, accounting for 40.9% of all notes in circulation and 86% of the total currency value. Coin usage has risen by 3.6% in volume, with Rs 1, 2, and 5 coins most common. The RBI\u2019s digital currency (e\u20b9) saw a 334% surge in value, predominantly in the Rs 500 denomination. Although counterfeit Rs 10, 20, and 2000 notes have decreased, fake Rs 200 and Rs 500 notes have increased. Note printing costs have risen to Rs 6,372.8 crore. The RBI is also promoting eco-friendly disposal of old notes by recycling them into furniture. Additionally, it launched the \u2018Sa-Mudra\u2019 project for modernizing and digitizing currency handling.

Disaggregated reserves that disclose individual currencies fell to $11.47 trillion from $11.84 trillion. Despite this decline in absolute dollar amounts held, the percentage of reserves denominated in U.S. dollars rose slightly to 57.8% from 57.3%, driven by a 7.7% appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which diminished the dollar value of non-dollar holdings. Among other currencies, only the Canadian dollar (\"loonie\") showed a small increase in percentage share, rising to 2.77% from 2.74%. The euro\u2019s share dropped to 19.8% from 20.0%, the pound sterling to 4.73% from 4.98%, while the Chinese yuan stayed at 2.18% and the yen held nearly steady at 5.82%.

Meanwhile, the euro\u2019s share rose to 20.1%, its highest level since late 2022. The Swiss franc experienced the most notable surge, quadrupling its share to 0.8%, the highest since the euro\u2019s introduction in 1999. This shift follows significant foreign exchange market volatility, as the U.S. dollar weakened nearly 4% in Q1 and over 7% in Q2, largely due to unpredictable policy changes under President Donald Trump, including the imposition of new tariffs in April.\n\nConversely, the Swiss franc has gained strength, increasing 14% against the dollar and bolstering its image as a safe-haven currency. While fluctuations in currency value don\u2019t necessarily translate into reserve preferences, recent developments have sparked renewed discourse about potential de-dollarization. However, there is broad consensus that any move away from the dollar\u2019s dominance would be gradual. Despite its percentage drop, dollar-denominated reserve claims still rose 1.4% to $6.72 trillion, though this was outpaced by the euro\u2019s 2.6% increase to $2.3 trillion.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1752075758.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stablecoin-supply-is-growing-fast-heres-how-it-compares-to-cash-66f12bc1","title":"Stablecoin supply is growing fast.

While stablecoins are not considered physical currency, Coinbase and others note their growing use as a potential alternative to cash and traditional payments due to advantages like faster settlement and lower fees, especially for cross-border transactions.\n\nCurrently, about 88% of stablecoin transaction value stems from crypto trading, with only 6% used for payments. Despite concerns over their misuse in illicit activities, such as money laundering and ransomware, regulatory interest is intensifying. The U.S. Senate is advancing the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate the stablecoin sector for the first time. If passed, it could support mainstream adoption.

Major exchanges include COMEX (U.S.), Shanghai Futures Exchange (China), and TOCOM (Japan).\n\n3. **Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs/ETFs)**: These securities are backed by physical gold and saw record inflows of $89 billion in 2025, especially from North America.\n\n4. **Physical Gold (Bars and Coins)**: Accessible to retail investors via shops or online dealers.\n\nGold price movements are influenced by investor sentiment, foreign exchange rates (particularly the U.S. dollar), geopolitical tensions, central bank policies, and gold reserve purchases.

investors buy gold and what fuels the market","snippet":"As of January 2026, gold prices have reached a historic high of over $4,600 per ounce, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions and expectations of more accommodating U.S. monetary policies. There are several common ways for investors to gain exposure to gold:\n\n1. **Spot Market**: Primarily used by large buyers and institutions, with London as the dominant hub. This is a real-time market where prices are based on immediate supply and demand.\n   \n2. **Futures Market**: Investors trade contracts to buy or sell gold at a set future date and price. Major exchanges include COMEX (U.S.), Shanghai Futures Exchange (China), and TOCOM (Japan).\n\n3. **Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs/ETFs)**: These securities are backed by physical gold and saw record inflows of $89 billion in 2025, especially from North America.\n\n4. **Physical Gold (Bars and Coins)**: Accessible to retail investors via shops or online dealers.\n\nGold price movements are influenced by investor sentiment, foreign exchange rates (particularly the U.S. dollar), geopolitical tensions, central bank policies, and gold reserve purchases. Growing demand from central banks, notably China, has also supported prices amid global economic uncertainty.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1768211146.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/record-start-2026-brings-prospect-5000-gold-into-view-2026-01-13/","title":"Record start to 2026 brings prospect of $5,000 gold into view","snippet":"Gold prices soared to a historic high of $4,629.94 per ounce by mid-January 2026, with projections now eyeing the $5,000 mark amid escalating global tensions and robust investor interest. Silver also surged to a record $86.22/oz, marking a strong continuation of 2025\u2019s rally. Gold has already climbed over 6% this year after gaining 64% in 2025. Key drivers include geopolitical instability\u2014such as U.S. political turmoil, international conflicts, and threats of intervention\u2014alongside expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, making precious metals more attractive.\n\nCentral banks have maintained strong gold demand, notably China, which increased its holdings for the 14th consecutive month. Meanwhile, gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw unprecedented inflows of $89 billion in 2025, with SPDR Gold Trust holdings hitting multi-year highs.\n\nSilver, with a 147% rise last year, is also benefitting from investment demand and market imbalances. Analysts predict silver could reach or exceed $90/oz, with some forecasting a potential peak above $100 due to its heightened sensitivity to market conditions. However, experts like HSBC caution that easing supply constraints later in 2026 could drive a market correction.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1768306134.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-december-new-bank-loans-beat-forecast-stimulus-juices-credit-demand-2026-01-15/","title":"China 2025 new bank loans lowest in seven years, policy support needed","snippet":"In 2025, China issued 16.27 trillion yuan ($2.33 trillion) in new bank loans, the lowest level since 2018, reflecting weak credit demand amid a prolonged real estate downturn and subdued business and household borrowing. This slowdown challenges policymakers, despite a record $1.2 trillion trade surplus. The decline from 18.09 trillion yuan in 2024 highlights inadequate private sector leverage and a reliance on increased government bond issuance for economic stabilization.\n\nDespite year-long weakness, credit demand improved in December due to government stimulus. Banks extended 910 billion yuan in new loans, exceeding expectations and showing a notable rise from November's 390 billion yuan. Household loan demand remained negative, but corporate lending increased sharply. Measures such as a 500-billion-yuan investment tool introduced late in the year may be yielding early results.\n\nAnalysts expect GDP growth of 4.9% in 2025 with a slowdown to 4.5% in 2026, prompting calls for further stimulus. In response, the PBOC plans to lower interest rates on certain monetary tools by 25 basis points and signaled potential for further reserve requirement ratio (RRR) and rate cuts. Broader monetary indicators also showed strengthening liquidity at year-end.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768471020.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gold.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/how-much-gold","title":"How Much Gold Has Been Mined?","snippet":"11 Feb 2025 \u2014 Download pdf Market size and structure.

This surge follows a prolonged recovery since M2 bottomed out in April 2023, when it experienced a record 4.63% decline. January represents the 11th straight month of year-over-year increases in M2, which now stands at $21.56 trillion\u2014$6.1 trillion above pre-pandemic levels. While the increase in money supply suggests ample liquidity for consumer spending and potential market rallies, it also complicates the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing inflation back to its 2% target. Chairman Jerome Powell has previously downplayed M2\u2019s relevance for economic growth, but other economists argue it remains a valuable economic signal. The exact causes behind the recent jump in M2 are unclear, but increased bank lending and the Fed\u2019s recent interest rate reductions may have played a role.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1740514560.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-march-new-bank-loans-rise-364-trln-yuan-beating-expectations-2025-04-13/","title":"China March bank lending beats expectations, more stimulus expected","snippet":"In March 2025, new bank loans in China surged to 3.64 trillion yuan ($500 billion), significantly surpassing analysts' expectations of 3 trillion yuan and rebounding from February's low of 1.01 trillion yuan. This rebound is part of broader efforts by Chinese policymakers to support the economy amid an intensifying trade war with the United States. Total new loans in Q1 rose to 9.78 trillion yuan from 9.46 trillion in the same period last year.\n\nThe increase was driven by strong growth in both household loans (985.3 billion yuan) and corporate loans (2.84 trillion yuan). Analysts suggest this stronger-than-expected lending could boost economic confidence and potentially delay a cut in the banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR). Nevertheless, fiscal stimulus, including expanded deficits and bond issuance, remains crucial to counter sluggish domestic demand and external pressures.\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) signaled its readiness to deploy more macroeconomic tools if needed. March\u2019s financial indicators also showed stable M2 money supply growth at 7.0% and improvement in total social financing growth to 8.4%, reflecting increased government support through bond issuance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1744550068.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-january-new-bank-loans-surge-513-trillion-yuan-beat-expectations-2025-02-14/","title":"China January bank lending hits record high on policy stimulus","snippet":"In January 2025, China's new bank lending surged to a record 5.13 trillion yuan ($706.4 billion), exceeding expectations and more than quadrupling December's total, as the central bank intensified efforts to stimulate a sluggish and uneven economic recovery. Although driven partly by seasonal factors, the spike signals the central bank\u2019s increased support amid weakening domestic demand and rising external pressures, especially from renewed U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump.\n\nDespite the headline loan figure, credit demand remains soft, with bank loan growth hitting record lows. However, this was offset by stronger non-bank credit growth and robust government bond issuance. Loans to households and businesses saw notable increases, but overall loan growth and money supply metrics indicated ongoing caution in the economy.\n\nTotal bank lending in 2024 dropped to 18.09 trillion yuan, its lowest since 2019, despite 5% GDP growth meeting official targets. To combat challenges, including the new trade war, Beijing aims to sustain growth through fiscal expansion, rate cuts, and debt relief initiatives. Additional monetary easing is expected, with eyes on the upcoming March parliamentary meeting for more stimulus measures. The central bank is also adjusting monetary tools like reserve ratios to bolster the economy.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1739530290.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696dc9d9cd7c8325a6f6e4eccb4a0638","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for global money supply estimates","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"635de60f-e067-42f0-aaec-eacab5450e09","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"40193730-1187-4339-adcf-ad77d7e928c9","turn_exchange_id":"529be634-3485-4d0c-b508-16cf4a25b63c"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"40193730-1187-4339-adcf-ad77d7e928c9","children":["3937871f-586a-438e-ba29-f8bc0876ea8e"]},"3937871f-586a-438e-ba29-f8bc0876ea8e":{"id":"3937871f-586a-438e-ba29-f8bc0876ea8e","message":{"id":"3937871f-586a-438e-ba29-f8bc0876ea8e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768802834.099371,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Crafting a refined response to the user","content":"The user's statement is too strong: \"no matter what definition\" and \"fully backed\" are ambiguous.

The surge, a 28% increase from April 2022, was driven by heightened market volatility following U.S. trade tariffs under Donald Trump\u2019s 'Liberation Day' policy. Despite speculation about the dollar's reserve status and a decline in its value, it continued to dominate trading due to increased use of forward contracts to hedge U.S. exposures.\n\nThe survey also highlighted the yuan\u2019s growing prominence in global FX markets, rising to 8.5% of trading volume, while sterling's market share fell sharply to 10.2%, raising doubts about its reserve currency status. The euro\u2019s share fell to just under 29%. Trading activity remained concentrated, with Britain, the U.S., Singapore, and Hong Kong accounting for 75% of activity. Additionally, over-the-counter interest rate derivatives trading jumped 59% to $7.9 trillion, with a noticeable shift toward euro and yen-denominated contracts, reflecting changing interest rate policies, particularly in Japan.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1759240707.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/percent-global-fx-reserves-dollars-ticks-up-amounts-fall-imf-data-shows-2025-03-31/","title":"Percent of global FX reserves in dollars ticks up, amounts fall, IMF data shows","snippet":"At the end of 2024, global foreign exchange reserves decreased to $12.36 trillion from $12.75 trillion in the prior quarter, according to IMF's COFER data. Disaggregated reserves that disclose individual currencies fell to $11.47 trillion from $11.84 trillion. Despite this decline in absolute dollar amounts held, the percentage of reserves denominated in U.S. dollars rose slightly to 57.8% from 57.3%, driven by a 7.7% appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which diminished the dollar value of non-dollar holdings. Among other currencies, only the Canadian dollar (\"loonie\") showed a small increase in percentage share, rising to 2.77% from 2.74%. The euro\u2019s share dropped to 19.8% from 20.0%, the pound sterling to 4.73% from 4.98%, while the Chinese yuan stayed at 2.18% and the yen held nearly steady at 5.82%.

Retail CBDCs target the public for everyday use, while wholesale CBDCs are reserved for transactions between financial institutions.\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins has accelerated CBDC development, with countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, Eastern Caribbean, and Nigeria already launching retail versions. Efforts are also underway in Switzerland, the EU, and the U.S., where the Federal Reserve has conducted experiments. However, the U.S. faces potential legislative hurdles, as some lawmakers express concerns about privacy and government surveillance associated with a digital dollar.

This surge follows a prolonged recovery since M2 bottomed out in April 2023, when it experienced a record 4.63% decline. January represents the 11th straight month of year-over-year increases in M2, which now stands at $21.56 trillion\u2014$6.1 trillion above pre-pandemic levels. While the increase in money supply suggests ample liquidity for consumer spending and potential market rallies, it also complicates the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing inflation back to its 2% target. Chairman Jerome Powell has previously downplayed M2\u2019s relevance for economic growth, but other economists argue it remains a valuable economic signal. The exact causes behind the recent jump in M2 are unclear, but increased bank lending and the Fed\u2019s recent interest rate reductions may have played a role.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1740514560.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696dfb2f6a5883299c514a26626e6936","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching global M2 and gold price time series","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"59e7a154-e84c-40f0-8526-adcd86fcc6cf","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"99303400-bcf3-44cd-b7db-baecaa50893e","turn_exchange_id":"87c4b68f-eca9-40a5-8e0b-dd1f53a89f7c"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"99303400-bcf3-44cd-b7db-baecaa50893e","children":["d7c82507-376b-472c-93e4-bbc45a18ec27"]},"d7c82507-376b-472c-93e4-bbc45a18ec27":{"id":"d7c82507-376b-472c-93e4-bbc45a18ec27","message":{"id":"d7c82507-376b-472c-93e4-bbc45a18ec27","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768815423.896264,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering global M2 data sources","content":"StreetStats might have the global M2 data I'm looking for, but it likely starts around 1999.

Meanwhile, the euro\u2019s share rose to 20.1%, its highest level since late 2022. The Swiss franc experienced the most notable surge, quadrupling its share to 0.8%, the highest since the euro\u2019s introduction in 1999. This shift follows significant foreign exchange market volatility, as the U.S. dollar weakened nearly 4% in Q1 and over 7% in Q2, largely due to unpredictable policy changes under President Donald Trump, including the imposition of new tariffs in April.\n\nConversely, the Swiss franc has gained strength, increasing 14% against the dollar and bolstering its image as a safe-haven currency. While fluctuations in currency value don\u2019t necessarily translate into reserve preferences, recent developments have sparked renewed discourse about potential de-dollarization. However, there is broad consensus that any move away from the dollar\u2019s dominance would be gradual. Despite its percentage drop, dollar-denominated reserve claims still rose 1.4% to $6.72 trillion, though this was outpaced by the euro\u2019s 2.6% increase to $2.3 trillion.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1752075758.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/imf-warns-tariffs-arent-answer-global-imbalances-2025-07-22/","title":"IMF warns tariffs aren't the answer to global imbalances","snippet":"In its 2025 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that global current account imbalances sharply widened in 2024, reversing a trend of narrowing since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The fiscal and external imbalances in the U.S., China, and the eurozone significantly contributed to this. The U.S. deficit rose by $228 billion to $1.13 trillion, China\u2019s surplus by $161 billion to $424 billion, and the eurozone\u2019s surplus by $198 billion to $461 billion. The IMF cautioned that such imbalances, if excessive, could elevate financial stress and undermine global stability.\n\nThe report criticized U.S. tariffs under President Trump's administration, stating that they offer minimal help in addressing imbalances and instead harm global demand and fuel inflation. IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas emphasized that domestic reforms\u2014like promoting consumption in China, increasing infrastructure spending in Europe, and reducing U.S. deficits\u2014are more effective solutions than tariffs. He also warned of growing geopolitical tensions and fragmentation, which may weaken the U.S. dollar\u2019s global role, increase market volatility, and shift the international monetary system toward alternative assets and currencies.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1753189548.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/imf-reserve-data-shows-stabilisation-third-quarter-2025-12-22/","title":"IMF reserve data shows stabilisation in third quarter","snippet":"In the third quarter of 2025, global foreign exchange reserves showed signs of stabilization following significant volatility in the second quarter, according to data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The U.S. dollar's share of reported reserves slightly declined to 56.92%, down from 57.08%, while the euro\u2019s share inched up to 20.33% from 20.24%. The Japanese yen also saw an increase in its share of reserves, rising to 5.82% from 5.65%.\n\nThe previous quarter had been marked by market turbulence, triggered in part by tariff announcements from U.S. President Donald Trump. Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that reserve managers appeared to adjust to currency fluctuations during Q3, contributing to the period of stabilisation.

The investment bank now estimates central banks will purchase 50 tonnes of gold per month, up from a previous 41 tonnes, and notes that if these purchases rise to 70 tonnes monthly, gold could reach $3,200 per ounce. In scenarios where policy uncertainty remains high\u2014such as continued trade tensions\u2014gold could surge to $3,300. Conversely, if the Federal Reserve maintains its current interest rates, prices may settle around $3,060.\n\nGoldman Sachs emphasizes that increasing ETF flows and consistent central bank buying could offset any decline in investor positioning, especially if financial, trade, or recessionary risks materialize. The firm also points to concerns over U.S. fiscal sustainability as a potential catalyst for an additional 5% price increase, pushing gold to $3,250 by December 2025. Reiterating its \"Go for Gold\" stance, the bank sees long gold positions as a powerful hedge in a volatile macroeconomic environment.","ref_id":{"turn_index":32,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1739836524.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/mar/18/gold-hits-record-high-over-3000-geopolitical-tensions-weakening-us-dollar-oil-stock-markets-inflation-business-live-news","title":"Gold hits record high over $3,000 amid rising geopolitical tensions; Thames Water receives six takeover offers - as it happened","snippet":"On March 18, 2025, gold prices surged to a record high of $3,038 per ounce, driven by rising geopolitical tensions, trade war fears, and a weakening US dollar. Analysts point to safe-haven demand amid inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, particularly relating to U.S. tariffs under President Trump. Oil prices also climbed due to conflict in the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, Thames Water announced it had received six takeover offers, with hopes to finalize a deal by June. The UK Competition and Markets Authority is reviewing several water companies\u2019 appeals to increase customer bills further. Centrica\u2019s CEO saw his pay nearly halve due to a reduced bonus, while Reach executives faced criticism for sizable bonuses amid staff discontent over modest raises.\n\nIn Germany, the Bundestag passed legislation allowing increased borrowing, signaling a historic fiscal shift. ANZ raised its gold forecasts, Google parent Alphabet reportedly acquired cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion, and fund managers made a significant shift away from U.S. equities due to recession and trade war concerns.\n\nAdditionally, South Yorkshire announced a move to public transport control, construction insolvencies remained high, and Lloyds Bank prepared for an IT reshuffle that may result in job losses.","ref_id":{"turn_index":32,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1742311760.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-central-banks-hunger-for-gold-shows-no-sign-of-being-quelled-this-year-932b1fa5","title":"Why central banks' hunger for gold shows 'no sign of being quelled' this year","snippet":"In 2024, central banks continued their strong appetite for gold, marking the 15th consecutive year of net purchases, according to the World Gold Council. Total official-sector gold purchases reached 1,044.6 metric tons, slightly lower than 2023 but maintaining a trend of over 1,000 metric tons annually for the third year in a row\u2014significantly higher than the 2010\u20132021 yearly average of 473 metric tons. Total global gold demand also climbed to a record 4,974.5 metric tons, driven by a 25% year-over-year surge in investment demand, which hit a four-year high of 1,179.5 metric tons.\n\nThe outlook for 2025 suggests continued strong demand, with geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty\u2014including U.S. policy changes under the Trump administration\u2014seen as key factors. New U.S. tariffs on China, and retaliatory measures, may increase inflation and bolster gold\u2019s appeal as a hedge. Central banks and ETF investors are expected to remain pivotal drivers of gold demand. Gold prices have responded accordingly, with April futures recently settling at a record $2,875.80 per ounce. Despite unpredictability in individual bank strategies, global instability continues to make gold an attractive strategic asset.","ref_id":{"turn_index":32,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1738748820.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696dfb2f6a5883299c514a26626e6936","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for global money supply and gold price data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"59e7a154-e84c-40f0-8526-adcd86fcc6cf","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"26039946-367a-4b6a-abad-26fb3a01b2e7","turn_exchange_id":"87c4b68f-eca9-40a5-8e0b-dd1f53a89f7c"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"26039946-367a-4b6a-abad-26fb3a01b2e7","children":["b5e6742c-5805-4087-985f-d1015ebc5937"]},"b5e6742c-5805-4087-985f-d1015ebc5937":{"id":"b5e6742c-5805-4087-985f-d1015ebc5937","message":{"id":"b5e6742c-5805-4087-985f-d1015ebc5937","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{}},"create_time":1768816079.1158795,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["You are nearing the maximum number of calls to this tool.

Announced by LBMA CEO Ruth Crowell at a precious metals conference in Kyoto, this initiative builds on a voluntary reporting system starting in January 2026. The database, launched in January 2025, facilitates faster and more efficient collection and processing of data from refineries listed on LBMA\u2019s \"good delivery\" list, which includes 66 gold and 83 silver refiners worldwide.\n\nThis move comes in response to a 55% rise in gold prices this year, reaching a record high of $4,381 per troy ounce on October 20, driven in part by concerns over U.S. tariffs. Currently, refineries report the origin of sourced material annually; the LBMA aims to transform this into an ongoing, practical dialogue for better oversight without overburdening refiners. Increased transparency and trust in gold sourcing are essential, especially as global markets grow more complex. LBMA's monthly vault data, a vital resource during market fluctuations, will be further strengthened by this initiative.","ref_id":{"turn_index":35,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1761551595.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696dfb2f6a5883299c514a26626e6936","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for accessible gold price and money data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"59e7a154-e84c-40f0-8526-adcd86fcc6cf","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d0fc87b8-a21b-4ba9-a8d3-128397007bf9","turn_exchange_id":"87c4b68f-eca9-40a5-8e0b-dd1f53a89f7c"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d0fc87b8-a21b-4ba9-a8d3-128397007bf9","children":["f07cc00c-babb-48c7-a26e-d7f24b729d2b"]},"f07cc00c-babb-48c7-a26e-d7f24b729d2b":{"id":"f07cc00c-babb-48c7-a26e-d7f24b729d2b","message":{"id":"f07cc00c-babb-48c7-a26e-d7f24b729d2b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768816331.634953,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Crafting response with available data","content":"Since we can't fetch new data, I'll craft the response using sources we already have.

A common *proxy* (and the one you and I have already been using) is **G4 M2**: sum of **US + Eurozone + China + Japan** broad money, converted to USD each period.\n\nStreetStats explicitly defines its \u201cGlobal M2\u201d this way, and flags a key nuance: **USD-denominated global M2 moves with FX**, so a stronger/weaker dollar can change the USD value even if local-currency money supplies don\u2019t change much; they also compute a constant-exchange-rate variant (\u201cGlobal Total (No FX)\u201d). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\nAs of **Jan 16, 2026**, StreetStats reports **Global M2 \u2248 $97.833T** (latest month with all four economies: Nov 2025). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n## 3) Gold has risen ~8\u201310\u00d7 over ~20 years (so gold *can* dominate the ratio)\nUsing Macrotrends\u2019 annual-average series as a rough anchor:\n- **2005 annual average:** **$444.99/oz**\n- **2025 annual average:** **$3,442.92/oz**\n- **2026 annual average (so far in their table):** **$4,505.39/oz** \ue200cite\ue202turn32search12\ue201\n\nThat\u2019s ~**7.7\u00d7** (2005\u21922025) and ~**10.1\u00d7** (2005\u21922026) in annual-average terms. \ue200cite\ue202turn32search12\ue201\n\nThis matters because if global broad money grew \u201conly\u201d a few-fold over the same horizon (typical for broad money over decades), then **the ratio \\(M/G\\)** would show a **net downtrend** across 20 years (gold rising faster than money).\n\n## 4) What the 20-year *shape* of \\(M_t/G_t\\) almost surely looks like\nEven without pinning down every annual datapoint, the *mechanics* force a pattern:\n\n- **Money supply (broad money) is relatively smooth and upward-sloping** over decades (with bursts during crises).\n- **Gold is cyclical** (multi-year bull/bear phases).\n\nSo \\(R_t = M_t/G_t\\) tends to be a **sawtooth**:\n- **Falls** during major gold bull legs (gold outruns money growth).\n- **Rises** during gold bear/flat periods (money keeps compounding while gold stalls).\n\nMapping that onto the last ~20 years, the natural regime segmentation is:\n- **2005\u20132011:** gold\u2019s big bull market \u2192 ratio **compresses** (falls).\n- **2011\u20132015:** gold drawdown/sideways while money expands \u2192 ratio **re-expands** (rises).\n- **2020-ish:** sharp money expansion + gold rally \u2192 ratio direction depends on which moved more in your chosen window, but the *impulse* is a jump in \\(M\\).\n- **2023\u20132026:** very strong gold leg (in your current regime) \u2192 ratio **compresses** again.\n\nThat\u2019s the \u201cstructural\u201d story: **money grows steadily; gold reprices in jumps.**\n\n## 5) A concrete \u201ctoday\u201d sanity check (using StreetStats G4 M2 + gold annual-average anchor)\nIf we use:\n- \\(M \\approx \\$97.833T\\) (StreetStats G4 M2) \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n- \\(G \\approx \\$4,505/oz\\) (Macrotrends 2026 annual average figure) \ue200cite\ue202turn32search12\ue201  \n\nThen:\n\n\\[\nR \\approx \\frac{97.833\\times 10^{12}}{4505} \\approx 2.17\\times 10^{10}\\;\\text{oz}\n\\]\n\n\u2248 **21.7 billion ounces** (\u2248 **675k tonnes**) of gold-equivalent.\n\nThis number is *not* the main point; the point is how it moves: **a gold melt-up drives \\(R\\) down hard, even if money supply is still rising.**\n\n## 6) The key caveats you should keep front-and-center\n1) **\u201cGlobal money supply\u201d isn\u2019t unique** (M0 vs M1 vs M2 vs \u201cbroad money\u201d).

The 2026 forecast also increased to $3,000 from $2,700. Spot gold has already risen 25% in 2025, nearing the total growth seen in 2024. The surge is attributed to economic uncertainty, global trade tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, and de-dollarisation trends. Despite recent fluctuations, with prices touching $3,500 before easing to $3,273, analysts expect continued support due to volatile U.S. tariff policies and central bank buying. However, some warn of weakened demand from the jewellery market and potential price corrections if trade tensions ease.\n\nSilver has underperformed, rising 12% in 2025. Its 2025 average price is forecast at $33.10 per ounce, with expectations for 2026 raised to $34.58 due to a structural deficit and increasing demand from the clean energy and automotive sectors. Analysts see silver's market tightening further as oversupply in solar cells diminishes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1746013165.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/annual-2026-gold-price-forecast-tops-4000oz-first-time-2025-10-27/","title":"Annual 2026 gold price forecast tops $4,000/oz for first time","snippet":"Analysts predict that gold prices will average above $4,000 per ounce for the first time in 2026, according to a Reuters poll of 39 analysts and traders. The median forecast is $4,275/oz for 2026, up from $3,400 forecasted three months prior. For 2025, the expected average is $3,400, an increase from $3,220 estimated in July. Gold has already surged 54% in 2025, averaging $3,281 so far, amidst geopolitical and economic instability, weakening confidence in financial institutions, and declining U.S. dollar dominance.\n\nStrategic central bank purchases and sustained inflows into exchange-traded funds have driven gold\u2019s rally, which is expected to continue, albeit at a moderated pace. Investors are increasingly viewing gold as a core portfolio asset rather than a speculative one.\n\nSilver forecasts have also risen, with expected averages of $38.45 in 2025 and $50 in 2026, driven by a 65% surge in 2025. The metal, benefiting both from its safe-haven and industrial roles\u2014especially in solar, electric vehicles, and AI data centers\u2014is expected to face ongoing supply deficits, attracting investors as a lower-cost alternative to gold.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1761563771.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/business/annual-gold-price-to-top-4k-per-ounce-for-first-time-next-year-analysts/","title":"Annual gold price to top $4K per ounce for first time next year: analysts","snippet":"Analysts predict that the annual price of gold will exceed $4,000 per ounce in 2026, marking a historic milestone following a record high of $4,381.58 earlier in October 2025. A Reuters poll of 39 experts sees gold averaging $4,275 next year, up significantly from July's forecast of $3,400. For 2025, the average is projected at $3,400, also revised upward. Gold has surged over 50% this year due to factors like inflation fears, economic instability, a weaker US dollar, President Trump's tariffs, high interest rates, and a government shutdown. The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cuts have further boosted gold's appeal as a non-yielding safe-haven asset.\n\nAnalysts believe the ongoing rally reflects deeper concerns about global financial systems and loss of confidence in policymakers. Silver has also experienced a huge rise, up 65% this year, hitting a record $54.47 per ounce, largely due to supply deficits and increasing industrial demand from sectors like solar technology, electric vehicles, and AI data centers. Forecasts for silver have been raised to $38.45 in 2025 and $50 in 2026. Analysts expect the pace of gains to slow but believe fundamental drivers will keep both precious metals in high demand.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1761584255.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696e02a5629c832e9a864c51e418bbc1","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for StreetStats G4 M2 and gold data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"16d239d0-0e6b-461a-9619-b638b9c6fe76","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"f4d1b1ac-9250-43a4-b486-e472e1ec25bc","turn_exchange_id":"a6c7f070-33af-4bce-8cf6-90aee6da3fee"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f4d1b1ac-9250-43a4-b486-e472e1ec25bc","children":["3bbd713e-2065-4354-8650-d83928bd7ef4"]},"3bbd713e-2065-4354-8650-d83928bd7ef4":{"id":"3bbd713e-2065-4354-8650-d83928bd7ef4","message":{"id":"3bbd713e-2065-4354-8650-d83928bd7ef4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768817323.058467,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Opening StreetStats page for M2 data","content":"The search results show a StreetStats page with the information I need for historical global M2.

The bank now forecasts average prices at $3,015 per ounce for 2025 and $2,915 for 2026, up from previous estimates of $2,687 and $2,615, respectively. This revision is driven by continued instability from the Ukraine conflict, Middle East tensions, and evolving U.S. foreign policy. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of new tariffs is fueling a global trade war, raising concerns about inflation and economic growth.\n\nAlthough spot gold dipped 1.4% after reaching a record $3,167.57, HSBC expects central banks to continue buying gold, albeit at potentially reduced levels compared to recent years, depending on price movements. If gold prices fall below $2,700, speculative selling may increase, but physical demand and central bank purchases could also revive. HSBC also notes that a stronger U.S. dollar in late 2025 could limit gold\u2019s upside, especially if anticipated interest rate cuts do not occur. While gold is traditionally a safe-haven asset, its appeal diminishes in high-interest environments due to its lack of yield.","ref_id":{"turn_index":23,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1743689269.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/mar/18/gold-hits-record-high-over-3000-geopolitical-tensions-weakening-us-dollar-oil-stock-markets-inflation-business-live-news","title":"Gold hits record high over $3,000 amid rising geopolitical tensions; Thames Water receives six takeover offers - as it happened","snippet":"On March 18, 2025, gold prices surged to a record high of $3,038 per ounce, driven by rising geopolitical tensions, trade war fears, and a weakening US dollar. Analysts point to safe-haven demand amid inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, particularly relating to U.S. tariffs under President Trump. Oil prices also climbed due to conflict in the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, Thames Water announced it had received six takeover offers, with hopes to finalize a deal by June. The UK Competition and Markets Authority is reviewing several water companies\u2019 appeals to increase customer bills further. Centrica\u2019s CEO saw his pay nearly halve due to a reduced bonus, while Reach executives faced criticism for sizable bonuses amid staff discontent over modest raises.\n\nIn Germany, the Bundestag passed legislation allowing increased borrowing, signaling a historic fiscal shift. ANZ raised its gold forecasts, Google parent Alphabet reportedly acquired cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion, and fund managers made a significant shift away from U.S. equities due to recession and trade war concerns.\n\nAdditionally, South Yorkshire announced a move to public transport control, construction insolvencies remained high, and Lloyds Bank prepared for an IT reshuffle that may result in job losses.","ref_id":{"turn_index":23,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1742311760.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/investing-usd200-in-gold-8715076","title":"Got an Extra $200? Here's How Much You Could Make in 20 Years Investing in Gold","snippet":"This article from Investopedia explores the long-term potential of investing in gold by using a hypothetical $200 investment. It illustrates gold\u2019s historical performance, notably its rise from under $100 per ounce in the 1970s to breaking above $2,000 by 2024. A $200 investment in gold made in 2000 could have grown to nearly $1,900 by 2024, depending on purchase timing and price fluctuations.\n\nGold is praised for its role as a store of value, inflation hedge, and portfolio diversifier, especially during economic or geopolitical crises. Key factors that influence gold prices include inflation, real interest rates, U.S. Federal Reserve policy, currency fluctuations, and investor sentiment. However, gold also has downsides: it doesn\u2019t generate income, is volatile, and physical ownership entails storage and security costs.\n\nThough gold has delivered respectable long-term returns similar to the S&P 500 (excluding dividends), it hasn't always outperformed equities, especially when dividends are included. The article also compares gold to assets like Bitcoin, which has outpaced gold in recent years but with much greater volatility. Overall, the piece emphasizes that gold can be a valuable component of a diversified investment strategy but is not without risks.","ref_id":{"turn_index":23,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":48},"pub_date":1727293890.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696e02a5629c832e9a864c51e418bbc1","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for annual average gold price datasets","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"16d239d0-0e6b-461a-9619-b638b9c6fe76","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"1f99fb8a-d75a-4c36-97f3-ead1b05ba410","turn_exchange_id":"a6c7f070-33af-4bce-8cf6-90aee6da3fee"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1f99fb8a-d75a-4c36-97f3-ead1b05ba410","children":["9a3d5f4b-85c3-40e7-9ae6-732bc3d9f5ef"]},"9a3d5f4b-85c3-40e7-9ae6-732bc3d9f5ef":{"id":"9a3d5f4b-85c3-40e7-9ae6-732bc3d9f5ef","message":{"id":"9a3d5f4b-85c3-40e7-9ae6-732bc3d9f5ef","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768817745.864098,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Using IndexMundi for gold price data","content":"I can use IndexMundi to get monthly gold price averages, which may work well for approximating annual averages.

The metal has surged 14% since the start of 2025, making it one of the best-performing assets since Trump\u2019s presidency began. His unpredictable tariff policies have spurred fears of inflation and recession, causing stock markets to correct and increasing gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset.\n\nExpectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and strong physical demand from both institutional and private investors are further boosting gold's rally. The current surge recalls major gold milestones during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Tariff concerns have funneled over $70 billion worth of gold into New York, although inflows are now slowing.\n\nInvestment banks such as Citibank and Goldman Sachs have raised their gold price forecasts, with some analysts predicting prices could reach $3,300 by year-end. Gold has nearly tenfolded since 2000, outperforming major stock indices, bolstered by central bank purchases, geopolitical instability, and rising global debt levels.","ref_id":{"turn_index":25,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1741950494.855,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-poised-monthly-gain-soft-dollar-us-rate-cut-hopes-2025-08-29/","title":"Gold poised for monthly gain on soft dollar, US rate-cut hopes","snippet":"Gold prices are set for a monthly gain, having risen 3.9% in August 2025, and reaching a one-month peak of $3,423.16 per ounce. As of August 29, spot gold edged slightly lower to $3,408.26 due to profit-taking. This increase is largely driven by a weaker U.S. dollar and rising expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. A softer dollar makes gold cheaper for non-dollar holders, boosting demand.\n\nU.S. gold futures for December also declined 0.2% to $3,469. Market sentiment is influenced by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller\u2019s support for rate cuts starting next month and continuing over the next 3-6 months. Market data suggest an 86% probability of a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed's next meeting.\n\nInvestors eagerly await the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, which could impact interest rate expectations. Other precious metals declined slightly: silver at $38.81/oz, platinum at $1,349.45/oz, and palladium at $1,101/oz. Additionally, Fed Governor Lisa Cook filed a lawsuit disputing former President Trump's power to remove her from office.","ref_id":{"turn_index":25,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1756443018.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696e02a5629c832e9a864c51e418bbc1","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for USD gold price data on IndexMundi","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"16d239d0-0e6b-461a-9619-b638b9c6fe76","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"ee90161f-6d41-4979-bd6b-140ab41debbc","turn_exchange_id":"a6c7f070-33af-4bce-8cf6-90aee6da3fee"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ee90161f-6d41-4979-bd6b-140ab41debbc","children":["8d716b88-7064-46c6-ab69-e78b103d9218"]},"8d716b88-7064-46c6-ab69-e78b103d9218":{"id":"8d716b88-7064-46c6-ab69-e78b103d9218","message":{"id":"8d716b88-7064-46c6-ab69-e78b103d9218","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768817772.397749,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring alternative sources for M2 data","content":"Now we have the indexmundi data for gold monthly prices in USD, which is great.
