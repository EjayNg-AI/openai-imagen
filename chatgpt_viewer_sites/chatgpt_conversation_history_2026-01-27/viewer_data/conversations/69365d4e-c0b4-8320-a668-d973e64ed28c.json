Read and unpack it.\n\n---\n\n### How he got me to trust him\n\n**Victim:** I put in 77k. I actually borrowed money from nine of my friends, about 40k. Some of them criticized me, \u201cWhy are you so dumb?\u201d I think it's not true, not like because we are too dumb; it's just because they are too good.\n\nI actually met this man from Coffee Meets Bagel. He would ask, like, okay, why not we just change to another platform to chat, so he asked for my WhatsApp number. He slowly got to know me: what is my background, what is my personality like, what do I like. He was quite concerned about me: \u201cHow\u2019s your day? Have you eaten? Have you had your meal?\u201d It made you feel like we were closer and closer.\n\nHe knows I'm that kind of sporty person, I like exercise. He also likes exercise, doesn\u2019t smoke or whatever. He made it very real, because he mentioned that he is staying in Yishun and told me which block. At that time, recently it was raining a bit, so he was like, okay, just now he had slept. He asked me, \u201cOh, what do you like to eat, what is your preference?\u201d I said, okay, I like Korean food. He asked me out after two weeks. It\u2019s not like very soon, but not so soon yet.\n\n\n### How I got hooked on the platform\n\n**Victim:** He just played a small game, so I followed his instruction, logged in to his account. After you play, you see he actually earns that amount. \u201cDo you want to join me?\u201d I refused and rejected him many times.\n\nI think he always used my weakness point, because you know I love my family and friends a lot. If I do this investment, I can make my family\u2019s life better, like a more stable life. He made you feel like this is just a small sum of money. I said I don\u2019t know if I should trust you or not, but he said, \u201cYou can just put 100 first.\u201d\n\nIt made me feel guilty that I didn\u2019t trust the person. I\u2019m thinking like, oh, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m just going to meet him in another few days, so I think this is another point he used to make me fall into this trap.\n\nI put in 100 at first; I got back 110, about 10% interest, so it makes you have the impression like, \u201cI told you so, you can actually earn.\u201d He asked me, why not just put one thousand. Then he said I could borrow from my friend or my family. I said I never borrow money from anyone before, and he said it\u2019s okay, after the three days you can get back the money and you can return back to them, you can share some of your own with them.\n\nInitially he asked me I shouldn\u2019t share with anyone, because if I share, everyone gets to play this, so in the end we can\u2019t really earn. I think because my friends quite trust me, some of them never even ask a question, they just straight away send me the money.\n\n\n### How I lost S$77,000\n\n**Victim:** They said we broke the rules; they blocked our account. He asked me to contact the customer service first. So actually the customer service mentioned, in order to unfreeze this account, I needed to pay about 50% tax, about 70k plus. We topped up the 35k, then they said there was some test, you just need another like 10 or 11k.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s never-ending, and then I tried to look back, like how much total amount I had borrowed. Then I realized it\u2019s 40k. I think at one point I realized it could be a scam, I should wake up.\n\n\n### What I\u2019ve learnt\n\n**Victim:** What I learned from the lesson is, everything I kept to myself, I never shared it. At least if more people listen to the story, they can help you to analyze it, because that time I was quite stuck, so I wouldn\u2019t really think straight. I might have, like, not told them the truth. So if they approach in a nice way, \u201cCould it be a scam, what are you really facing, or what kind of investment is it?\u201d as more and more people ask me, some might have made me think twice.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t think, \u201cWe won\u2019t become the next one.\u201d We always do underestimate them. They always change a lot of strategy. I think they are quite good in psychology. They actually have a group of people behind it to plan all these things. So it\u2019s not like because we are too dumb, it\u2019s just because they are too good.\n\nA lot of people actually shared with me they also got scammed before, but they never reported. So this is also one of the reasons why I want to make this video: to actually create awareness. Even if I can reduce one, I think this is quite worth it for me to do this.\n\n\n### Anti-scam advice\n\n**Narrator:** So if you\u2019re talking to someone online and there\u2019s something a little off about them, call the anti-scam hotline or visit scamalert.sg.

I\u2019ll also highlight deeper patterns that recur across romance-investment scams (especially \u201cpig-butchering\u201d / *sha zhu pan* operations).\n\n---\n\n# 1. **Establishing Trust: The Emotional Grooming Phase**\n\n### **1.1 Slow-burn intimacy**\nThe scammer does not rush. Two weeks before proposing to meet is intentional:  \n- **Fast attraction creates suspicion**;  \n- **Slow but steady grooming creates the illusion of authenticity**.\n\nThe scammer uses:\n- Daily check-ins (\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d) \u2014 classic intimacy markers.  \n- Mirroring: liking the same things (sporty, Korean food, healthy lifestyle).  \n- Hyper-local details (Yishun block, the weather) to anchor the persona into the victim\u2019s physical world.\n\nThis is not random. Scammers have playbooks on how to:\n- Elicit self-disclosure  \n- Mirror identity keywords to create *felt similarity*  \n- Construct a character that feels \u201cplausible enough\u201d\n\n**Key mechanism:** *Reciprocal disclosure \u2192 emotional bonding \u2192 decreased suspicion.*\n\n### **1.2 Constructing a \u201ctrust gradient\u201d**\nThe scammer begins on a legitimate dating app, which acts as a *credibility priming factor*. Moving the conversation to WhatsApp is standard in scams to avoid platform moderation.\n\nOnce moved, the victim enters a psychological enclosure where:\n- The scammer controls the tempo  \n- There is no external feedback  \n- The victim develops parasocial attachment  \n\nThis attachment later becomes leverage.\n\n---\n\n# 2. **Hooking Through Demonstrated Profit: The Controlled Win Mechanism**\n\n### **2.1 Manufactured success demonstration**\nThe scammer uses what is effectively a \u201crigged demo account.\u201d  \nHe walks the victim through logging into his \u201caccount,\u201d letting her witness:\n\n- Real-time profit  \n- High returns  \n- Consistent success  \n\nThis gives the illusion of:\n- System legitimacy  \n- Technical transparency  \n- Personal competence (\u201che knows how to invest\u201d)  \n\n### **2.2 Foot-in-the-door technique**\nShe refuses many times \u2014 the scammer *expects this*.\n\nThey pivot to:\n- \u201cJust try $100.\u201d  \n- Immediate +10% return (manufactured).  \n- Strong suggestion that reluctance is distrust of *him*, not of the system.\n\nThis flips the emotional frame:\n\n**The rational concern becomes framed as a relationship flaw.**\n\nThat\u2019s extremely powerful manipulation.\n\n---\n\n# 3. **Exploiting Personal Values: Familial Duty as Leverage**\n\nThe victim\u2019s own words reveal a key vulnerability:\n\n> \u201cI love my family and friends a lot\u2026 I wanted to give them a more stable life.\u201d\n\nScammers actively probe:\n- Responsibility to family  \n- Desire to provide  \n- Cultural pressure to \u201cbe financially secure\u201d  \n- Personality traits like conscientiousness  \n\nThese become motivational levers.\n\nThe scammer used guilt, responsibility, and aspiration rather than greed.\n\nThis is critical: **Most victims are not greedy \u2014 they are caring, responsible people.**\n\n---\n\n# 4. **Social Isolation Strategy**\n\nThe scammer explicitly instructs secrecy:\n> \u201cDon\u2019t share with anyone\u2026 otherwise everyone will play and the returns will drop.\u201d\n\nTranslation: *Remove external sanity checks.*\n\nScams survive by:\n- Cutting off social support  \n- Preventing peer critique  \n- Preventing triangulation of information  \n\nOnce isolated, the victim falls into a closed cognitive loop with the scammer as the only signal source.\n\n---\n\n# 5. **Escalation Phase: The Drain-and-Squeeze Mechanism**\n\nOnce the victim is financially committed:\n\n### **5.1 Frozen accounts & punitive fees**\nThis is textbook pig-butchering:\n- Account \u201cfreezes\u201d  \n- Payment of \u201ctax\u201d or \u201cunlock fees\u201d  \n- Step-wise extortion (\"just another 10k\")  \n\nThere is *no exit* until the victim can no longer pay.\n\n### **5.2 The psychological trap**\nVictims feel:\n- Sunk cost fallacy  \n- Shame and secretiveness  \n- Urgent need to recover losses  \n- Emotional attachment to the scammer persona  \n\nAll these factors combine to prolong participation **even after suspicions arise**.\n\nShe even computes all the borrowing only at the end \u2014 meaning the scam\u2019s emotional load impaired her ability to track her own finances.\n\nThis is extremely common.\n\n---\n\n# 6. **Turning Point: The Break in the Illusion**\n\nVictims often wake up when:\n- Demands escalate beyond plausibility  \n- The promised meeting never happens  \n- External reality intrudes (e.g., friends ask questions)  \n- The family loan total becomes unmanageable  \n\nThis victim reached the \u201ccognitive snap\u201d when she realized the debt magnitude.\n\nHer statement:\n\n> \u201cI should wake up.\u201d\n\nThis shift is usually extremely painful and associated with intense shame, which leads to the next problem.\n\n---\n\n# 7. **The Aftermath: Shame, Silence, and Social Cost**\n\nVictims often blame themselves. But she correctly reframes it:\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s not because we are too dumb. It\u2019s because they are too good.\u201d\n\nThis is true.  \nPig-butchering operations:\n- Train scammers in psychology  \n- Use scripts optimized through trial and error  \n- Involve teams: relationship groomers, platform operators, crisis managers  \n\nThese are *industrialized* scams.\n\nVictims are up against:\n- Highly practiced social engineers  \n- Coordinated manipulation teams  \n- Sophisticated psychological profiling  \n\nIt is not a fair fight.\n\n### **Why victims do not report**\n- Shame  \n- Fear of judgement  \n- Fear of friends discovering lies  \n- Self-blame  \n- Fatalism (\u201cpolice can\u2019t recover the money anyway\u201d)  \n\nHer willingness to speak publicly is rare and extremely valuable.\n\n---\n\n# 8. **Deep Lessons: What Actually Went Wrong**\n\n## **8.1 No third-party auditing**\nIsolation made the scam possible. If *anyone* had visibility earlier, it might have been stopped.\n\n## **8.2 Trust without verification**\nEmotional trust was substituted for factual verification.\n\n## **8.3 Misplaced guilt**\nVictims often feel guilty for doubting the scammer \u2014 a weaponized inversion of trust.\n\n## **8.4 Lack of financial red flags knowledge**\nInvestment platforms rarely, if ever:\n- Guarantee returns  \n- Require secrecy  \n- Ask for \u201ctax\u201d before withdrawals  \n- Require repeated top-ups  \n\nOnce a single red flag is recognized, the illusion collapses.\n\n---\n\n# 9. **Why this case is particularly sobering**\n\n- She was not na\u00efve; she was emotionally intelligent, caring, and relationally open.  \n- The scammer exploited traits most people consider virtues.  \n- Her borrowing from friends shows how deeply scammers can override self-preservation instincts through emotional entanglement.  \n- She was manipulated not through greed, but through aspirations for loved ones and fear of disappointing someone she trusted.\n\nThis underscores a reality:\n\n### **Romance-investment scams do not primarily target greed. They target emotional vulnerability, trust-seeking, and social isolation.**\n\n---\n\n# 10. **Macro Observation: Increasing Professionalization**\n\nThe victim insightfully notes:\n\n> \u201cThey have a group behind it to plan all these things.\u201d\n\nThis is accurate.\n\nModern operations include:\n- Scriptwriters  \n- Conversational coaches  \n- Real-time supervisors who guide scammers during chats  \n- Fraud tech teams who build the fake websites  \n- \u201cEmotion specialists\u201d who intervene when victims hesitate  \n\nThese are *organized crime syndicates using psychologically optimized workflows*.\n\n---\n\n# 11. **Preventative Measures (Beyond the Video Advice)**\n\nA more systemic anti-scam mindset should include:\n\n### **11.1 Always externalize high-impact decisions**\nIf you cannot explain the investment to a financially literate friend, it is almost certainly fraudulent.\n\n### **11.2 Any request for secrecy is a red flag**\nLegitimate opportunities do not require silence.\n\n### **11.3 No legitimate platform freezes funds for \u201ctax\u201d before withdrawal**\nThat mechanism exists *only* in scams.\n\n### **11.4 Emotional mirroring from a stranger is a manipulation tactic**\nFast alignment of interests, values, and lifestyle is usually scripted.\n\n### **11.5 Trust must be verifiable**\nEmotional resonance \u2260 authenticity.\n\n---\n\n# 12. **Final Reflections**\n\nThis interview is a strong reminder of:\n- How sophisticated scam operations have become  \n- How emotionally vulnerable any human can be when socially isolated  \n- How shame suppresses reporting, enabling the cycle to continue  \n\nAbove all, it demonstrates a fundamental truth:\n\n### **Humans are not wired to detect long-form social engineering \u2014 especially when affection, identity, and aspiration are leveraged simultaneously.**\n\nYour instinct that this was \u201csobering\u201d is accurate. It exposes structural weaknesses in human cognition that can affect anyone, particularly when they are emotionally isolated or aspirationally stretched.\n\nIf you want, I can also produce:\n- A psychological breakdown of specific manipulation techniques  \n- A framework to teach others how to detect such scams  \n- A checklist to evaluate online interactions  \n- A sociological analysis of why Singapore is currently targeted heavily by such syndicates  \n\nJust let me know."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"sonic_classification_result":{"latency_ms":null,"simple_search_prob":null,"complex_search_prob":null,"no_search_prob":null,"search_complexity_decision":null,"search_decision":null,"simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.12,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_3cls_ev3","classifier_config":{"model_name":"snc-pg-sw-3cls-ev3","renderer_name":"harmony_v4.0.15_16k_orion_text_only_no_asr_2k_action","force_disabled_rate":0.0,"force_enabled_rate":0.0,"num_messages":20,"only_user_messages":false,"remove_memory":true,"support_mm":true,"n_ctx":2048,"max_action_length":4,"dynamic_set_max_message_size":false,"max_message_tokens":2000,"append_base_config":false,"no_search_token":"1","simple_search_token":"7","complex_search_token":"5","simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.12,"prefetch_threshold":0.55,"force_search_first_turn_threshold":1e-05,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"passthrough_tool_calls":true,"timeout":1.0},"decision_source":"mainline","passthrough_tool_names":["api_tool","automations","bio","canmore","container","file_search","gcal","gcontacts","gmail","image_gen","python","python_user_visible"]},"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"4839ffa3-8997-48e9-9ed3-622a62a6f230","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"c6943b3e-5c81-44a2-9724-f1535ad3f5cb","turn_exchange_id":"afb2b712-15ac-4714-989f-582f67243145"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"c6943b3e-5c81-44a2-9724-f1535ad3f5cb","children":[]}}}
