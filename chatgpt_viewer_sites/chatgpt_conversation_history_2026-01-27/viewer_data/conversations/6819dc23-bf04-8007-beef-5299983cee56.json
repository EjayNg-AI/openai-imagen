After PIC expired (YA2018), the government introduced more targeted programs to continue supporting business digitalization. Key successors include **grants** like the Productivity Solutions Grant and Enterprise Development Grant, and **tax incentives** like the new Enterprise Innovation Scheme. These schemes, often under the umbrella of the SMEs Go Digital initiative, help companies adopt IT solutions, develop capabilities, and innovate. Below we detail the current schemes relevant to digital marketing, SEO services, and website development, especially for a small education business (e.g. a sole-proprietorship tuition center).\n\n## Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG)  \nThe **Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG)** is a funding program to help SMEs adopt pre-approved IT solutions and equipment for productivity. It is highly relevant for digital marketing tools and website development services.\n\n- **Qualifying Criteria:** Open to Singapore-registered businesses (including sole proprietorships) that are **actively operating in Singapore**, with **\u226530% local ownership** (Singaporean or PR) and meeting the SME size definition (group annual sales \u2264 S$100 million or \u2264 200 employees)\u301042\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301042\u2020L189-L197\u3011. The applicant must use the solution in Singapore and must not have made any payment or deposit to the vendor **before** the grant application (no retrospective funding)\u301042\u2020L194-L202\u3011. Certain entities like charities, government agencies, and societies are excluded\u301042\u2020L206-L214\u3011, but typical commercial businesses (including education/training services) are eligible. \n\n- **Supported Activities:** PSG supports **pre-scoped digital solutions** that are vetted and pre-approved by the government. This includes both sector-specific solutions and those for all industries. Notably, there is a category for **\u201cDigital Marketing Packages\u201d** under PSG\u301028\u2020L65-L73\u3011. Through this, companies can engage pre-approved vendors for services like Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (Google Ads), social media marketing, and content marketing. For example, an education center can adopt a pre-approved digital marketing package to improve its online visibility and lead generation with 50% subsidy\u301028\u2020L65-L73\u3011. PSG also supports other solutions relevant to going digital (e.g. Customer Relationship Management software, e-commerce website development, digital learning management systems, etc.), as long as they are on the approved list. Custom or non-pre-approved solutions are **not** funded under PSG\u301030\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301030\u2020L183-L190\u3011, so the business must choose from the listed solutions/vendors.\n\n- **Funding Amount:** PSG generally funds **up to 50%** of the cost of the approved solution (the company pays the remaining portion)\u301028\u2020L65-L73\u3011. As of 2025, the standard subsidy is 50% for most solutions (higher support levels were provided in previous years for certain sectors, but those have normalized). There is an **annual grant cap of S$30,000** per company for PSG-supported solutions\u301043\u2020L293-L301\u3011, calculated from 1 April to 31 March each year. This cap means a company can receive up to $30k in PSG subsidies in a year \u2013 after hitting the cap it can apply again in the next period if needed\u301043\u2020L293-L300\u3011. Companies are encouraged to plan their grant usage accordingly. Each PSG application typically covers one solution package; multiple applications are allowed (e.g. one for digital marketing, another for an e-commerce website) as long as they address different needs\u301043\u2020L254-L262\u3011.\n\n- **Application and Process:** The business must apply **before** purchasing or signing any contract. The steps are: identify a suitable pre-approved solution/vendor from the official list on the GoBusiness portal, obtain a quotation, then submit a PSG application via the **Business Grants Portal (BGP)** using your business login (CorpPass)\u301043\u2020L239-L248\u3011. In the application, you\u2019ll provide the vendor quote and some company details (e.g. financial statements to show SME status). Processing takes about 4\u20136 weeks\u301043\u2020L305-L313\u3011. Upon approval, a Letter of Offer is issued, and the company can proceed to engage the vendor and implement the project. After implementation, the company submits a claim on BGP with the invoice and proof of payment, and then receives the grant reimbursement (covering up to 50% of the cost). \n\n- **Relevance to a Sole-Proprietor Tuition Business:** A sole proprietorship that meets the above criteria **would qualify** for PSG. In practice, since the owner of a tuition center is likely a Singaporean and it\u2019s a small business, it fits the SME criteria (100% locally owned, usually well below the revenue/employee threshold). The business can tap PSG to engage third-party experts for digital marketing and web development *provided the vendors are PSG pre-approved*. For instance, there are PSG-approved digital marketing packages offered by certified agencies that cover SEO setup, online advertising, and social media management\u301028\u2020L65-L73\u3011. The tuition center could apply for funding to subsidize 50% of the cost of such a package, which directly supports engaging an external marketing firm. Similarly, if the tuition center needs a new website or an e-commerce system for class bookings, it can adopt a pre-approved \u201cE-commerce/Online Shop\u201d solution under PSG (many vendors offer web design with online payment integration) and get 50% funding support. Importantly, the PSG does **allow** engaging third-party vendors \u2013 in fact, it requires using one of the pre-approved vendors or solutions to qualify\u301030\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301030\u2020L239-L248\u3011. As long as the tuition business applies in advance and goes through the proper process, it can leverage PSG to reduce the cost of digital marketing services and website development. There are no special sector exclusions for education; in fact, the government has an Industry Digital Plan for Training and Education SMEs, and PSG funding is available to implement solutions recommended in that plan\u301014\u2020L1-L4\u3011. In summary, PSG is the primary grant a small tuition center would use to subsidize hiring an external agency for its SEO, digital advertising, or website needs.\n\n## Enterprise Development Grant (EDG)  \nThe **Enterprise Development Grant (EDG)** is a broad-based grant for projects that help businesses grow, innovate, or transform. It supports deeper capability-building initiatives, which can include developing a digital strategy or brand strategy. However, EDG is **project-oriented** and typically does *not* fund routine marketing execution costs. \n\n- **Qualifying Criteria:** The business must be **registered and operating in Singapore**, with **\u226530% local shareholding** (for companies \u2013 in the case of a sole proprietorship, this effectively means the owner should be a Singapore Citizen or PR)\u301045\u2020L174-L182\u3011. While there is no strict size limit, EDG is aimed at SMEs and mid-sized firms; applicants should be financially able to start and complete the project (EnterpriseSG will assess the company\u2019s financial health and resources)\u301045\u2020L183-L186\u3011. A sole proprietorship can apply if these conditions are met \u2013 there is no requirement to be incorporated. In practice, having some track record (e.g. a year of operations and financial statements) is helpful since you must submit business financials and the project will be evaluated partly on the company\u2019s capability to execute it\u301045\u2020L249-L258\u3011\u301045\u2020L254-L262\u3011. \n\n- **Supported Scope and Terms:** EDG supports **projects** under three pillars \u2013 *Core Capabilities, Innovation & Productivity, and Market Access*. For a tuition business looking to improve its digital presence, the most relevant would be **Core Capabilities**, specifically *Strategic Brand and Marketing Development*. Under this category, the company can undertake a project with a consultant to develop a comprehensive marketing strategy, branding, and possibly a digital marketing plan to reach new audiences\u301045\u2020L212-L220\u3011\u301021\u2020L347-L355\u3011. The grant will cover activities like business needs analysis, strategy development, and implementation plans. **However, EDG explicitly does *not* cover the execution/production of marketing materials or ongoing marketing costs.** According to EnterpriseSG guidelines, costs for producing collaterals (e.g. designing a website, printing brochures, videos), running marketing campaigns, or paying for SEO/SEM services and social media management are **excluded** from EDG support\u301021\u2020L358-L366\u3011. In other words, EDG can fund the **planning and consultancy** portion of a marketing/digital transformation project, but not the direct hiring of an agency to perform SEO or the costs of building a website. Those implementation costs would have to be borne by the company (or funded through other schemes like PSG). This distinction is important: EDG is meant to help companies build long-term capabilities (strategy, skills, product development, etc.), rather than subsidize operational marketing expenses.\n\n- **Funding Amount:** For SMEs, EDG will co-fund up to **50% of the project costs**\u301045\u2020L156-L164\u3011. (Larger firms get a lower support rate, typically 30%.) Qualifying project costs can include **third-party consultancy fees, software and equipment costs, and even internal manpower costs** related to the project\u301045\u2020L151-L158\u3011. In a digital strategy project, this means the consultant\u2019s fees would be subsidized 50%, and if, say, new software or a prototype website is developed as part of the project scope, those costs might be considered. There is no fixed dollar cap per company per year for EDG, but each project is budgeted and approved individually. Projects can range widely in cost (from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars), and approval is subject to evaluation by Enterprise Singapore (the agency administering EDG). Notably, since April 2023 the maximum support level was reduced to 50% (previously it was up to 70% during the pandemic period)\u301045\u2020L156-L164\u3011, except for certain sustainability or industry-specific initiatives which can still get higher support.\n\n- **Application and Approval:** EDG applications are more involved than PSG. The business must submit a detailed project proposal through the **Business Grants Portal**, including project scope, objectives, deliverables, timeline, and cost estimates. Typically, you would need to engage a consultant or vendor to help draft a proposal and quotation. EnterpriseSG will evaluate the proposal on its merits \u2013 considering the project\u2019s feasibility, how it helps the business, the competency of the chosen consultant, and the company\u2019s commitment (including ability to fund the remaining cost)\u301045\u2020L189-L197\u3011. The approval process can take 8-12 weeks or more, as officers may ask for clarifications or adjustments to the scope. If approved, a Letter of Offer will specify the grant amount and terms. During the project, progress reports may be required, and upon completion, the business must submit evidence of deliverables and costs to claim the grant reimbursement. \n\n- **Assessment for a Sole-Proprietor Tuition Business:** A sole proprietorship in the education sector **can** apply for EDG, but the project should be sufficiently scoped and beneficial. In the context of digital marketing or website development, EDG would **not** subsidize simply hiring an agency for SEO or building a basic website (those are better covered by PSG, as explained above). Instead, the tuition center might use EDG if it aims to undertake a **larger transformation project** \u2013 for example, rebranding the business, developing a new pedagogy delivery platform, or formulating a digitalization roadmap for expansion. As part of such a project, a consultant could help devise a marketing strategy (including how to leverage SEO/SEM, what kind of website and content is needed, etc.), and EDG could cover half the consulting fees. But any actual website development or digital marketing campaign execution coming out of the plan would **not** be funded by EDG\u301021\u2020L358-L366\u3011. The business would have to fund those or use PSG separately. Moreover, small businesses need to consider the administrative effort: EDG projects require commitment in time and co-funding; for a one-person tuition operation, applying for a grant to do strategic planning might be overkill unless the business has plans to scale up. In summary, while a sole proprietor tuition center is *eligible* for EDG in principle\u301045\u2020L174-L182\u3011\u301045\u2020L178-L186\u3011, EDG is only useful if the owner intends to invest in a strategic capability-building project (with a significant scope beyond just getting more students via marketing). For straightforward needs like engaging third-party experts for SEO or a website, EDG is not the appropriate mechanism \u2013 PSG or normal business expenses would be the route, since EDG won\u2019t cover those execution costs.\n\n## Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS)  \nThe **Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS)** is a tax incentive program introduced in Budget 2023 (effective from Year of Assessment 2024 to 2028) to encourage businesses to invest in innovation, R&D, and capability development. It essentially revives the spirit of PIC in a more focused way by offering enhanced tax deductions (or a cash payout option) for specific innovation-related expenditures.\n\n- **Qualifying Criteria:** **All** business entities \u2013 including companies, partnerships, and **sole proprietorships** \u2013 are eligible to claim EIS benefits if they incur qualifying expenditure in the relevant activities\u30104\u2020L1021-L1029\u3011. The business must be operating in Singapore and the expenses must be incurred during the basis period for YA2024\u2013YA2028. There is no requirement for a minimum local shareholding for the tax deductions (since it\u2019s a tax measure available to any taxpayer business). However, to opt for the **cash payout** in lieu of tax deductions, the entity must have at least **3 full-time local employees** (Singaporean or PR employees, excluding owners) in the basis period and must have filed its tax returns by the filing due date\u30104\u2020L1028-L1036\u3011\u30104\u2020L1031-L1039\u3011. This condition is to ensure only actively hiring businesses can convert the credit to cash. A one-person sole proprietorship with no staff would **still get the enhanced tax deductions** on qualifying spending, but **would not be able to take the cash payout** due to not meeting the 3-employee criterion.\n\n- **Scope of Qualifying Activities:** The EIS covers five categories of activities that the government wants to encourage: (1) **R&D activities** conducted in Singapore, (2) **Registration of Intellectual Property (IP)** such as patents, trademarks, (3) **Acquisition and Licensing of IP Rights**, (4) **Workforce Training** courses that are approved and subsidized by SkillsFuture Singapore (and aligned with the Skills Framework), and (5) **Innovation projects done in collaboration with Polytechnics, ITE, or other qualified research partners**\u301035\u2020L74-L82\u3011. Expenditures that fall under these categories are eligible for enhanced tax deduction. It\u2019s important to note that **general business digitalization expenses (like engaging a digital marketing agency or developing a commercial website) are *not* on this list of qualifying EIS activities**. In other words, paying a vendor for SEO services or a new website would not qualify for any enhanced deduction under EIS \u2013 those remain ordinary business expenses. The EIS is more targeted at *innovative* activities (R&D, IP creation) and capability development (training, co-innovation with institutes). For example, if the tuition center develops a new online learning prototype in partnership with a polytechnic, that project cost could qualify; or if the owner takes certified courses in digital marketing (training), those course fees qualify. But hiring a third-party to run Google Ads or build a website does not fall under the listed categories, so no enhanced tax break applies there.\n\n- **Benefit Quantum:** The incentive is quite generous for the specified activities: businesses can claim **400% tax deductions** on qualifying expenditure, up to certain caps. Specifically, for each of the first four categories (R&D, IP registration, IP acquisition/licensing, and training), up to **$400,000** of spend per year can enjoy 400% deduction\u30104\u2020L997-L1004\u3011. This means up to $1.6 million of expenditure (if spread across all four categories) could get quadruple deduction, translating to a significant reduction in taxable income. For the fifth category (innovation with polytechnics/ITE), the cap is lower: up to **$50,000** per year at 400% deduction\u30104\u2020L1006-L1014\u3011. Any expenditure beyond those caps simply gets the normal 100% deduction (or normal capital allowance for IP, etc.). If the business has insufficient profits to utilize these deductions, it has the option to convert up to **$100,000** of qualifying expenditure into a cash payout at a 20% rate, i.e. up to **$20,000 cash** per year\u30104\u2020L1008-L1014\u3011\u30104\u2020L1011-L1019\u3011. This cash option is analogous to PIC\u2019s cash payout (though PIC was 60% on $100k, EIS is 20%) and is particularly useful for startups or small firms not yet profitable \u2013 provided, again, that the firm has at least 3 local employees on payroll to be eligible for the payout. The EIS is available for five years initially (YA 2024 through YA 2028)\u30104\u2020L989-L997\u3011.\n\n- **How to Claim:** There is no separate grant application for EIS; it is claimed as part of the annual income **tax filing** with IRAS. The company or sole proprietor will indicate the qualifying expenditures in the relevant sections of the tax return (a special schedule for EIS may be required). IRAS will then allow the enhanced deduction in the tax assessment. If opting for the cash payout (instead of deduction), the business must file a claim with IRAS after the end of the financial year \u2013 this is done via an IRAS e-Service where you submit details of the spending and supporting documents\u30103\u2020L27-L34\u3011. The cash payout, if approved, will be disbursed (and the expenditures will not be given tax deduction since you converted them). Essentially, EIS is administered through the tax system rather than upfront like PSG/EDG. \n\n- **Relevance to Sole Proprietorship and Digital Marketing Activities:** For a sole proprietor running a tuition center, the EIS provides **limited direct benefit for hiring digital marketing or web design services**. If the proprietor incurs, say, $5,000 on SEO services, that $5,000 is just a normal business expense \u2013 it will reduce taxable income by $5,000 (100% deduction) as usual, but it doesn\u2019t fall into any EIS-enhanced category, so you **cannot claim a 400% deduction on it**. In contrast, if the proprietor spends on **training** \u2013 for example, attending an IMDA-SkillsFuture approved course on digital marketing or e-commerce \u2013 those course fees do qualify under EIS. Training expenditure can get a 400% tax deduction (up to $400k per year)\u30104\u2020L1001-L1004\u3011\u301034\u2020L49-L57\u3011. So if our tuition business owner spent $1,000 on a digital marketing course to improve their skills, they could deduct $4,000 from taxable income under EIS. This is a way EIS indirectly supports capability building in digital marketing, though it\u2019s via training the owner/staff, not paying an agency. Another possible angle: if the tuition business embarks on an *innovative project* (for instance, developing a unique e-learning platform or AI tutor with a local institute), those costs might qualify for the 400% deduction on up to $50k\u30104\u2020L1006-L1014\u3011. But simply creating a standard website or doing routine online advertising would not count as \u201cinnovation\u201d in the EIS sense. \n\n  It\u2019s also worth noting that many small sole proprietors may not earn enough profit to fully utilize large tax deductions. If the tuition center is modest in income and the owner\u2019s chargeable income is low, the value of a 400% deduction is limited (you can\u2019t deduct more than your income to create a loss under EIS \u2013 the excess is disregarded, not carried forward). The **cash payout option** could be attractive in such cases to get some benefit upfront. However, a typical one-person business likely has 0 or 1 employee, which fails the 3-local-employees requirement for the cash payout\u30104\u2020L1031-L1039\u3011. So in practicality, many sole proprietors cannot take the cash refund and can only use the tax deduction if they have taxable profits. \n\nIn summary, the Enterprise Innovation Scheme is a useful incentive for innovation and training investments \u2013 and a sole proprietor is eligible to use it \u2013 but it does **not directly subsidize hiring third-party digital marketing or web development services**. The sole proprietor should still record those expenses as normal business deductions. To get government support for those activities, PSG is the relevant scheme, whereas EIS would come into play if the proprietor pursues training or more innovative digital projects related to the business.\n\n## SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC) \u2013 Additional Support  \nIn addition to the above schemes, the government offers the **SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC)** as a further incentive to encourage SMEs to invest in enterprise transformation and workforce development. SFEC is a **one-off $10,000 credit** given to eligible employers, which can cover up to 90% of the out-of-pocket expenses for certain qualifying costs\u301048\u2020L45-L53\u3011. Essentially, it\u2019s like a bonus fund that companies can use **on top of** schemes like PSG, EDG, or training subsidies.\n\n- **Eligibility:** To receive the SFEC, a business must meet criteria including having **at least 3 local employees** (Singaporeans/PRs) and having contributed at least S$750 in Skills Development Levy (SDL) during a qualifying period (indicating active training or workforce investment). The company also needed to not have fully utilized a previous SFEC (as it\u2019s given only once per company). The government identified eligible firms in certain periods (e.g. in 2020 and again in 2021) and automatically awarded the credit \u2013 there is no separate application for SFEC. Many sole proprietors, especially if they have no or few employees, would **not** meet the 3-employee threshold and thus would not receive SFEC. In the case of a solo tuition teacher with no staff, SFEC wouldn\u2019t apply. But if the tuition business grows to have a few full-time tutors on payroll, it could qualify in future rounds.\n\n- **Usage:** For those who have it, the SFEC can be used to offset the portion of costs that the business has to bear when using other support schemes. For example, if a tuition center qualified for SFEC and undertakes a PSG-supported digital marketing project costing $10,000 \u2013 normally PSG would pay $5k (50%) and the company pays $5k. With SFEC, the company can use the credit to cover up to 90% of that $5k it must pay, i.e. an additional $4.5k, so effectively the company only pays $500 in the end. SFEC can similarly co-fund the company\u2019s portion of EDG projects or training course fees. It\u2019s meant to encourage companies to make full use of grants and send employees for training by reducing the net cost to nearly zero in some cases. Do note the $10,000 credit is a **lifetime** amount (until exhausted) and it expires if not used by a certain date (the government has set deadlines, e.g. many SFEC credits expire by end 2025 if not utilized). \n\n- **Application:** No direct application is needed once awarded. When claiming reimbursement for other grants (PSG, EDG, etc.) or subsidies, the system will automatically draw down from the SFEC to reimburse the additional 90% of out-of-pocket expenses. Businesses can check their SFEC balance on the Business Grants Portal or relevant SkillsFuture portal. \n\n- **Relevance to engaging digital marketing/SEO services:** SFEC by itself isn\u2019t a grant to hire an SEO agency, but it can significantly boost the support from PSG or EDG if the company has the credit. For instance, suppose our sole proprietor tuition business did manage to get SFEC (perhaps it has a few employees). If they use PSG to fund a marketing vendor, SFEC can cover most of the remaining cost that PSG doesn\u2019t cover. This would make engaging third-party digital marketers or web developers extremely cost-effective (nearly 95% subsidized when combining PSG + SFEC). However, as noted, a true one-man operation won\u2019t have SFEC. Thus, SFEC is a nice bonus for slightly larger SMEs, but not something a one-person business can count on. The key point is that all the main schemes \u2013 **PSG, EDG, EIS** \u2013 can be complemented by SFEC if eligible, but SFEC is not a standalone program for which one would specifically apply for digitalization support. It\u2019s an added funding to take note of when planning to use the other grants\u301042\u2020L208-L214\u3011.\n\n## Conclusion and Sector Considerations  \nFor a small tuition center (sole proprietorship), the Singapore government\u2019s support for digitalization comes primarily through **grants like PSG** for ready-to-use solutions and **tax incentives like EIS** for training and innovation. The **PSG** is the most directly applicable to subsidize hiring third-party experts for things like SEO, digital advertising campaigns, or building a functional website \u2013 it can halve the cost of such services, provided you use an approved vendor and apply correctly\u301028\u2020L65-L73\u3011\u301043\u2020L239-L248\u3011. The **EDG** is more about long-term capability building and would only come into play if the business undertakes a strategic project (and even then, it won\u2019t fund routine marketing execution)\u301021\u2020L358-L366\u3011. The **EIS** (and normal tax deductions) ensure that any money the business spends on digitalization is at least tax-deductible, and if the owner invests in his/her own skills or unique innovations, there are significant tax breaks available\u30104\u2020L999-L1007\u3011\u30104\u2020L1008-L1014\u3011. Additional programs under the **SMEs Go Digital** initiative \u2013 such as sector-specific Industry Digital Plans (for example, the Training and Adult Education digital roadmap) \u2013 can guide a tuition business on what digital solutions to adopt at different growth stages\u301012\u2020L123-L132\u3011\u301014\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Those resources often align with PSG funding (the solutions recommended by the industry roadmap are usually available with PSG grants). \n\nIn summary, a sole proprietor tuition business in Singapore **would qualify** for various government supports to go digital. It can get **grants** to defray the cost of engaging professional web designers or SEO/digital marketing agencies, and enjoy **tax savings** or credits for investing in its own innovation and training. There are no special prohibitions on the education sector in these schemes \u2013 on the contrary, the government encourages even small education providers to digitalize. By leveraging PSG (and possibly EDG for strategy, and EIS for training), the tuition center can modernize its marketing approach (e.g. build a strong online presence and reach students through digital channels) with substantial government co-funding. All applications for grants are done via the **Business Grants Portal**, and details on each scheme can be found on official sites like EnterpriseSG, IRAS, and the GoBusiness portal (links provided in the references). Using these support schemes effectively will help the business save costs and innovate, thus succeeding in the post-PIC era of Singapore\u2019s SME digital transformation journey. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Enterprise Singapore \u2013 *Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) Overview and FAQ*\u301042\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301043\u2020L239-L248\u3011\u301043\u2020L293-L301\u3011  \n- GoBusiness Gov Assist \u2013 *PSG Digital Marketing Solutions (SEO/SEM) description*\u301028\u2020L65-L73\u3011  \n- Enterprise Singapore \u2013 *Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) details*\u301045\u2020L151-L158\u3011\u301021\u2020L358-L365\u3011  \n- IRAS \u2013 *Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS) details*\u30104\u2020L997-L1004\u3011\u30104\u2020L1028-L1036\u3011  \n- SkillsFuture/AskGov \u2013 *SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC) information*\u301048\u2020L45-L53\u3011  \n- IMDA \u2013 *SMEs Go Digital: Training and Adult Education Industry Digital Plan*\u301014\u2020L1-L4\u3011\n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":325,"end_ix":339,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"\n\tIRAS | Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme\n","url":"https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/specific-topics/productivity-innovation-credit-(pic)-scheme#:~:text=The%20PIC%20scheme%20has%20expired,basis%20period%20of%20YA%202018","text":"The PIC scheme has expired after the Year\u00a0of Assessment (YA) 2018.

employ \u2265 3 local staff and have SFEC balance, up to 90 % of your out-of-pocket 50 % can be reimbursed\u2014effectively cutting your cash cost to 5 %.  \n* **Plan early for renewal.** If your SEO engagement is multi-year, you may apply again next FY (with a new package version or additional scope) once your cap resets.\n\nFollow this checklist and timeline and you will be able to secure the PSG subsidy smoothly and minimise the cash outlay for your SEO and digital-marketing upgrade."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":422,"end_idx":439,"safe_urls":["https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/resources/all-faqs/productivity-solutions-grant"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Enterprise
