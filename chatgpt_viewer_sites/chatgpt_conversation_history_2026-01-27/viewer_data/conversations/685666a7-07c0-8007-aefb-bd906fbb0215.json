This is a classic example of **emergent collective intelligence** in social insects.\n\n### Key Observations from Research\n\n#### 1. **Cooperative Object Transport**\nAnts (especially species like *Paratrechina longicornis*, *Formica*, and *Oecophylla smaragdina*) are known for their ability to **cooperatively carry large prey or food items**. In the wild, such tasks regularly require them to:\n- Coordinate their movement direction (as individuals initially pull in different directions)\n- **Navigate around obstacles** such as twigs, stones, or even vertical barriers\n- Adjust group membership dynamically (some ants drop out, others join)\n- **Iteratively \"solve\" navigation challenges** by trying different paths, sometimes even \"backtracking\" or rotating the object until the group finds a solution\n\n#### 2. **Obstacle Navigation and Iterative Refinement**\n**Empirical studies** (notably by Gelblum et al., 2015, and Czaczkes et al., 2011) have shown:\n- When carrying an object and encountering an obstacle, **ant groups will initially try to push or pull straight ahead**.\n- If blocked, the group **switches strategies**\u2014e.g., moving the object along the edge of the obstacle, or even moving backwards and trying a new route.\n- Through **repeated failed attempts and social communication (using pheromones, antennal signals, and \"recruitment\" behaviors)**, the ants \"collectively\" refine their approach until the object is moved past the obstacle.\n\n#### 3. **Emergence of Efficient Paths**\n- Experiments using transparent mazes, obstacles of various shapes, and even shifting obstacles, show that **ant groups can change their approach mid-task**. For example, if one path proves more successful, the group may reorient collectively, often without any central leadership.\n- The process is *iterative*: failed attempts lead to behavior modifications, with ants sometimes abandoning failed efforts and re-coordinating on more promising paths.\n\n#### 4. **Division of Labor and Dynamic Leadership**\n- Some studies note that **leadership can be dynamic**, with different individuals taking on leading roles at different times (see *Pheidole* species).\n- There is also a **dynamic reallocation of effort**\u2014some ants drop out if their pulling is counterproductive, which can help the group converge on a consensus direction.\n\n### Notable Example Studies\n\n1. **Gelblum et al., 2015 (Nature Communications):**  \n   - Showed that *Paratrechina longicornis* ants could collectively transport food around obstacles (walls, \"cul-de-sacs\") and that the colony would **change direction, pause, and try new strategies** until the object was successfully moved.\n\n2. **Czaczkes et al., 2011 (Animal Behaviour):**  \n   - Observed that ants carrying objects often get \"stuck\" at obstacles, but over time, through repeated attempts, would find an efficient way around or over the obstacle, *effectively \"solving\" the problem through trial and error*.\n\n3. **Dussutour et al., 2005 (Animal Behaviour):**  \n   - Found that groups of ants could move large objects through narrow passages and even through a maze, with the group collectively adjusting tactics as needed.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Task                                   | Obstacle Present | Iterative Refinement? | Collective Strategy Emerges? | Notable Studies                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Object transport (large food/prey)      | Yes              | Yes                  | Yes                          | Gelblum et al. 2015              |\n| Navigating mazes or narrow passages     | Yes              | Yes                  | Yes                          | Dussutour et al. 2005            |\n| Shifting leadership and group size      | Yes              | Yes                  | Yes                          | Czaczkes et al. 2011             |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**Ant colonies routinely exhibit collective problem-solving in nature**\u2014moving objects as a group, overcoming obstacles, and iteratively refining their actions until the challenge is solved. The behavior is robust, adaptive, and distributed, with no central planning. This has been well-documented in both natural settings and laboratory experiments, and is one of the canonical examples of *swarm intelligence* and *distributed problem solving* in biology.\n\nIf you require deeper technical references or want to discuss the algorithms (e.g., ant colony optimization) inspired by this, let me know."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"cb3558c7-e293-4f83-875e-589d00612133","request_id":"9531f932e904ce6d-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cb3558c7-e293-4f83-875e-589d00612133","children":["46b84978-0064-4735-b110-92e4a35a03e4"]},"46b84978-0064-4735-b110-92e4a35a03e4":{"id":"46b84978-0064-4735-b110-92e4a35a03e4","message":{"id":"46b84978-0064-4735-b110-92e4a35a03e4","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750493217.728,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Speculate whether such group dynamics can be applied to create AI systems that solve complex problems more efficiently, for example, by deploying an \"agent swarm\" that operates on similar principles, and whether elements of such dynamics can be found in existing algorithms such as beam search, A* search or Q learning"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"953202788ec7896e-IAD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2c61dbff-698c-41f4-9a6f-6e56917dbbae","children":["36a61556-e702-4c61-bfd7-acc3d246063a"]},"36a61556-e702-4c61-bfd7-acc3d246063a":{"id":"36a61556-e702-4c61-bfd7-acc3d246063a","message":{"id":"36a61556-e702-4c61-bfd7-acc3d246063a","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1750493219.199882,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Investigating AI groups**  \nSpeculating on AI groups' dynamics improving complex problem resolution.

|\n|-----------------|------------------------|---------------|\n| **Ant\u2011Colony Optimisation (ACO)** | Local agents lay & evaporate digital pheromone on a graph; collective shortest\u2011path emerges | Little or no *role switching* and usually static agent count; pheromone parameters are global hyper\u2011parameters \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201 |\n| **Beam search (LLMs, parsers, SMT

\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 |\n| **A\u2605 search** | Each node expansion is like an ant exploring a neighbour, guided by *f = g+h* (cost\u202f+\u202fheuristic) | Single \u201cant\u201d; no

|\n\n---\n\n###\u202fA speculative recipe for an **ant\u2011style agent swarm solver**\n\n1. **Spawn hundreds of lightweight \u201csolution crawlers\u201d.**  \n   - Each crawler maintains its own partial solution trace (parse tree, proof tree, path, program, etc.).  \n2. **Local sensing + minimal message budget.**  \n   - Crawlers only read a *local* view of a shared tuple\u2011space (digital pheromone grid) keyed by problem sub\u2011structure; writes are asynchronous and may collide.  \n3. **Ranked pheromone** = f(quality, novelty, recency).  \n   - Higher\u2011quality traces deposit more pheromone; evaporation removes obsolete hints.  \n4. **Dynamic recruitment / retirement.**  \n   - A resource manager monitors global progress and spawns new crawlers in under\u2011explored zones or kills ones that stall\u2014mirroring how ants abandon tug\u2011of\u2011war sub\u2011groups that create drag.  \n5. **Role plasticity.**  \n   - Crawlers can switch between *explorer*, *exploiter*, and *scout* modes based on local pheromone gradient and global stagnation indicators.  \n6. **Anytime termination.**  \n   - At any moment the system returns the best complete trace seen so far; more wall\u2011clock yields higher\u2011quality solutions, exactly like a real ant raid that keeps optimizing carrying routes.  \n\nThis framework can be layered **on top of, rather than instead of, classic search**: each crawler may internally run A\u2605 or even a language\u2011model step\u2011per\u2011token beam, but the *meta\u2011coordination* is emergent and pheromone\u2011driven.\n\n---\n\n###\u202fWhy bother?\u2003Potential advantages\n\n* **Robustness to deceptive local optima.**\u202fMultiple semi\u2011independent crawlers mean that early heuristic errors do not doom the entire search.  \n* **Graceful parallel scaling.**\u202fThe architecture is embarrassingly parallel; agents can be scheduled across many cores or machines with minimal synchronisation.  \n* **Fault tolerance.**\u202fLosing some agents (node failures) only reduces search breadth temporarily\u2014mirroring ants that lose workers in predation events.  \n* **Adaptive compute allocation.**\u202fMore agents are automatically directed toward hard regions of the search space where pheromone is sparse.  \n\n---\n\n###\u202fObstacles and research questions\n\n| Challenge | Open lines of attack |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| **Credit assignment** \u2013 which agent\u2019s action really improved the global solution? | Hierarchical reward shaping;

Recently, Anduril and General Atomics were chosen to prototype the US Air Force and Navy\u2019s new autonomous fighter jet, the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). Anduril\u2019s model, Fury, emphasizes advanced software and rapid, cost-effective delivery of drones and other technologies. This reflects a strategic shift toward cheaper, software-driven systems with greater autonomy in US defense. The CCA project, requiring sophisticated AI for autonomous operations, is a major advancement from previous applications primarily focused on target recognition. This technology supports flexible, collaborative missions with or without human pilots and is part of a broader vision for using more automated aerial warfare systems. The success of these initiatives during the Ukraine conflict has underscored the potential of drone swarms, which are envisioned to significantly enhance US military capabilities. Anduril's involvement in this program signals its growing influence and contribution to future warfare technology, as evidenced by its substantial investment backing and participation in key defense initiatives like Replicator.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1716890400.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6856682884108007960379af88484d5f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"88e3bee1-80a9-4e7e-adfa-6957a2c9fd7e","request_id":"9532eeed6809b5e2-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"88e3bee1-80a9-4e7e-adfa-6957a2c9fd7e","children":["44389456-f0e5-428b-8624-24732e11bf05"]},"44389456-f0e5-428b-8624-24732e11bf05":{"id":"44389456-f0e5-428b-8624-24732e11bf05","message":{"id":"44389456-f0e5-428b-8624-24732e11bf05","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750502920.658716,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering citations and sources","content":"It looks like I need to find more sources to ensure solid citations, at least 10 from high-quality references and 5 different domains.

The stack is protected by role-based-access-control (RBAC) rules and explicit kill-switches, and every agent can read or write shared context to co-ordinate plans.

They mitigate context-window limits for simple look-ups, yet they **do not fully solve chronic degradation issues** such as \u201clost-in-the-middle\u201d, multi-turn drift or brittle self-reflection. In other words, swarm orchestration has progressed faster than swarm-wide memory engineering: persistent, composable memory remains an open research frontier.\n\n---\n\n## 1\u2003Why persistent memory is still a bottleneck\n\nLLMs struggle to retrieve information buried in long prompts (\u201clost in the middle\u201d) and to stay consistent over long dialogues \ue200cite\ue202turn8search1\ue202turn8search5\ue201.  \nEven 128 K- to million-token context windows show rising error rates once the window fills, so na\u00efvely \u201cjust stuff it in\u201d fails in practice \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn12view0\ue201.  \nPopular single-agent frameworks such as AutoGPT initially adopted vector memories but later removed most back-ends because quality, recall and cost were poor in production \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 2\u2003What current swarm frameworks actually provide\n\n### 2.1 HAAS (Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm)  \n* Governance-heavy hierarchy ensures safety and task routing; each agent may maintain local state, but the repo offers **no native, unified memory bus**. Long-term recall is left to optional external stores or agent-level summarisation \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201.\n\n### 2.2 Swarms API / `swarms` GitHub project  \n* Every agent is instantiated with \u201c**memory systems for context retention**\u201d and can call long-term stores via a standard interface \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201.  \n* The `Agent` class exposes a built-in long-term memory hook that funnels embeddings into a chosen vector DB or graph DB \ue200cite\ue202turn7search2\ue201.  \n* **Limitation:** memory is *per-agent*; cross-agent coherence still depends on ad-hoc message passing.\n\n### 2.3 Community add-ons  \n| Add-on | Memory strategy | Strengths | Weaknesses |\n|-------|----------------|-----------|------------|\n| **LangGraph** | Dual-tier (short-term buffer + namespaced long-term store) | Explicit API for merging memories across graph nodes \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201 | Manual curation of what to store |\n| **LlamaIndex agents** | Pluggable `BaseMemory`, recent upgrade adds hierarchical summarisation and chunk-level retrieval \ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue201 | Easy to swap stores | Still summary-loses fine detail |\n| **Mem0** | Dynamic extraction + consolidation + graph-store recall; 26 % accuracy boost on LOCOMO benchmark \ue200cite\ue202turn4search4\ue201 | Production-oriented latency | Proprietary; not fully open-sourced |\n| **Medium \u201cAgent Memory\u201d pattern** | Vector memory distinct from chat history, acts like long-term episodic store \ue200cite\ue202turn4search7\ue201 | Simple to bolt on | Suffers from vector-noise & forgetting |\n\n---\n\n## 3\u2003How far do these go toward fixing context degradation?\n\n1. **Lookup vs reasoning.**  \n   Vector/graph memories excel at keyword or embedding similarity; they do **not guarantee** the model will *use* the information correctly once re-inserted, so logical coherence can still drift \ue200cite\ue202turn8search1\ue201.\n\n2. **Fragmentation across agents.**  \n   Without a globally shared address space, two agents may form conflicting beliefs\u2014exactly the \u201cstale cache\u201d phenomenon seen in large micro-service systems. HAAS and Swarms lack automatic conflict resolution; governance layers can kill or overwrite agents but not merge memories coherently \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue202turn3view0\ue201.\n\n3. **Summarisation loss.**  \n   Most frameworks rely on periodic summarisation to stay within context limits. Summaries compress nuance and introduce compounding error, a known failure mode in multi-turn evaluation benchmarks \ue200cite\ue202turn8search5\ue201.\n\n4. **Absence of virtual-memory-like paging.**  \n   Only experimental systems such as **MemGPT** implement OS-style tiered paging to swap in/out relevant slices automatically, allowing arbitrarily large working sets \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue201. These ideas have **not yet been integrated** into mainstream swarm orchestrators.\n\n---\n\n## 4\u2003Emerging research directions\n\n* **Hierarchical Aggregate Tree (HAT) memories** recursively compress dialogue trees, giving breadth coverage without quadratic cost\u2014promising for swarm-wide memory graphs \ue200cite\ue202turn4search10\ue201.  \n* **Taxonomies of Agentic AI** now explicitly list \u201cshared episodic & declarative memory\u201d as a core requirement for scalable swarms, indicating the community recognises the gap \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201.  \n* **Hybrid paging + retrieval**: combine MemGPT-style virtual context with RAG so each agent pages in its *own* working set while the swarm maintains a higher-level knowledge index.\n\n---\n\n## 5\u2003Pragmatic take-aways for building a robust swarm today\n\n1. **Adopt a tiered memory stack** (short-term buffer \u2192 vector/graph store \u2192 cold object storage) even if your orchestration layer doesn\u2019t enforce it.  \n2. **Namespace memories by task + agent role** to minimise cross-talk, then surface shared facts through a write-time approval gate.  \n3. **Schedule periodic distillation** (e.g., nightly) where a higher-level curator agent rewrites overlapping memories into a canonical knowledge graph.  \n4. **Monitor retrieval hit-rate and hallucination rate** as first-class metrics; many teams discover that retrieval quality, not model size, bottlenecks performance \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201.  \n5. **Prototype with MemGPT-style paging** for tasks that exceed 100 K tokens; wrap it as a tool each worker agent can call.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nPresent-day swarm frameworks *acknowledge* the memory problem and ship plug-in hooks, but **persistent, lossless, swarm-level memory remains largely unsolved**. Expect near-term progress to come from marrying virtual-memory managers (MemGPT), hierarchical compression (HAT), and automated reconciliation agents on top of existing orchestration layers."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn8search1\ue202turn8search5\ue201","start_idx":744,"end_idx":776,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://arxiv.org/html/2505.06120v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.06120v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1688666051.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"arxiv.org"},{"title":"LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation -
