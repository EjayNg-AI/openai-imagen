To gather feedback and refine these models, OpenAI will hold developer events starting in San Francisco and extending to Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. This initiative aligns with Altman\u2019s earlier statement in February about streamlining AI products and fits within the broader roadmap for advancing their AI technology.

While not replacements for GPT-4 or the forthcoming GPT-5, these models are text-based and equipped with chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance task-solving by dividing problems into manageable steps.\n\nSignificantly, the gpt-oss-20b model can run locally on consumer hardware, including PCs with 16GB of RAM and Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, marking a breakthrough for on-device AI processing. It is also compatible with NVIDIA GPUs; the more powerful gpt-oss-120b requires an RTX PRO GPU and substantial hardware power. NVIDIA H100 GPUs were used for training, with gpt-oss-120b requiring 2.1 million GPU hours.\n\nOpenAI partnered with multiple platforms\u2014Azure, Hugging Face, AWS, vLLM, Ollama, and Fireworks\u2014for broader accessibility. Hugging Face hosts the models for public download, and Ollama released a new app for easier deployment on Windows 11 PCs.

This update, released by OpenAI for GPT-4o users on various subscription tiers, has led to a surge of activity on social media, with many people transforming their old photos into Ghibli-style images. The new feature is possible due to OpenAI relaxing previous restrictions on image creation involving distinctive styles, celebrity likenesses, company names, and logos.

It\u2019s available via their API (Images API) and powers the image generation functionality in ChatGPT. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n2. **Image generation features in ChatGPT**  \n   OpenAI has rolled out image generation capabilities across tiers (Plus, Pro, Team, Free) using its multimodal or \u201comnimodal\u201d models (GPT-4o, etc.). These include \u201cImages in ChatGPT\u201d features. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news19\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n3. **No mention of GPT-Image-2 in official docs / release notes**  \n   The release notes, help center and official OpenAI docs reference *gpt-image-1*, the GPT Image API, and various image editing / generation capabilities. No official reference to \u201cGPT-Image-2\u201d. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n4. **Speculation & social chatter**  \n   There are some posts / threads speculating whether GPT-Image-2 has been \u201cstealth released\u201d or is coming.

The existing model for image generation/editing is \u201cgpt-image-1\u201d. If you have seen the term \u201cGPT-Image-2\u201d somewhere, it might be speculative or mislabelled.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can check internal \u201cbeta\u201d / waitlist announcements or developer forums to see if there are hints about \u201cGPT-Image-2\u201d incoming.
