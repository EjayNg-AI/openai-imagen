This development follows demand from users who previously created workarounds for internet access. Integrating web search with AI presents challenges due to the variability and complexity of language models.

Initially available to select paid users, the tool will eventually roll out to a broader audience. This move challenges Google's dominance in online search, which recently expanded its AI Overviews feature using the Gemini AI model. Other competitors like Microsoft, Meta, and the start-up Perplexity are also developing AI-driven search functionalities. To address the issue of inaccuracies, often referred to as \"hallucinations,\" OpenAI will include source citations in its responses.
