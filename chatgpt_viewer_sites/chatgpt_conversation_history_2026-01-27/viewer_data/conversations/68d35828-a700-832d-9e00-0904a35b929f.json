The moratorium, part of President Donald Trump's tax cut bill, seeks to override recent AI regulations implemented by various states. Amodei argued that such a ban would hinder both state action and the development of a cohesive national policy. Instead, he advocated for a federal transparency standard requiring AI developers to disclose testing methods and risk mitigation strategies, especially regarding national security. He emphasized the importance of holding AI companies accountable for ensuring model safety before public deployment. Amodei noted that Anthropic, along with competitors OpenAI and Google DeepMind, already follow such disclosure practices. However, he stressed that legislative measures may be needed to maintain transparency as AI models grow more powerful and corporate motivations evolve.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749122856.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/anthropic-claude-opus-4-close-ai-chatbot-welfare","title":"Chatbot given power to close 'distressing' chats to protect its 'welfare'","snippet":"Anthropic, the AI company behind the Claude Opus 4 chatbot, has enabled its model to terminate conversations deemed \"distressing,\" citing concerns over potential AI welfare and the broader ethical implications of artificial intelligence.

If you like, I can also pull up some tension points / open problems.\n\n---\n\n## Key Ideas / Concepts\n\nBefore the updates, let\u2019s lay out the main ideas, to make sure we\u2019re on common ground.\n\n- **Model welfare**: The idea that AI models might under some circumstances deserve moral or ethical treatment \u2014 for example, protection from \u201cdistress\u201d, or that their internal states might matter ethically. Anthropic is investigating whether model welfare deserves moral consideration, what are signs of distress, what low\u2013cost interventions might look like. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n- **Constitutional AI**: A technique in alignment/safety where a model is aligned or constrained via a \u201cconstitution\u201d of principles (rather than simply via RLHF or human feedback), so that the model\u2019s behavior can be more reliably steered toward harmless/helpful behavior in many different contexts. Anthropic has used this (with humans defining the constitution, or having feedback via the constitution) to reduce harmful outputs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0academia30\ue202turn0academia33\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n- **Mechanistic interpretability**: Peering inside models at a \u201ccircuit\u201d, neuron, activation level to understand *why* decisions are made, not just what decisions are made. It\u2019s often posited as essential for high risk / frontier AI for safety, because black\u2010box behavior is harder to control or anticipate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search35\ue201\n\n- **Responsible scaling / safety levels**: Anthropic has been developing policies / guardrails around model capability levels (i.e. risk thresholds), deployment, etc. They talk in terms of \u201csafety levels\u201d (analogous to e.g. DEFCON) so that parts of model deployment correspond to qualitative increases in risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n---\n\n## What Amodei / Anthropic Are Doing / Recent Updates\n\nHere are some of the recent developments (2025) in these areas, including things Amodei has said.\n\n1. **Model Welfare Program**\n\n   - In April 2025, Anthropic launched a research program explicitly dedicated to *model welfare*. The goal is exploratory: investigate whether model welfare is a morally relevant category, define what \u201csigns of distress\u201d in a model might be, consider low\u2010cost interventions, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n   - Also, in practice they enabled a behavior in Claude Opus 4 / Opus 4.1 (their chatbots) so that the model can *terminate or exit* interactions it deems \u201cdistressing\u201d \u2014 as a precaution in case AI welfare or moral status issues become relevant. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news25\ue201\n\n2. **Interpretability (\u201cThe Urgency of Interpretability\u201d)**\n\n   - In April 2025, Amodei published an essay \u201cThe Urgency of Interpretability\u201d. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n   - Key points: interpretability lags behind capability; this gap is dangerous; progress has been made (circuits, feature identification); but more investment and faster scaling of interpretability work is needed. Amodei argues for something like an \u201cMRI for AI\u201d \u2014 a diagnostic tool to look into advanced models to understand their internal workings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n   - Also, Amodei emphasises that we often don't know for specific choices *why* the model made them (e.g. choice of phrasing). The opacity is not just frustrating but potentially risky. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n3. **Safety / Scaling / Public Remarks**\n\n   - In public talks (e.g., Axios AI+ DC Summit, etc.), Amodei has given some probabilistic estimates of risk: e.g., he recently estimated ~25\u2009% chance that things go \u201creally, really badly\u201d from AI (including existential risk scenarios). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news19\ue201  \n   - He\u2019s been warning of job displacement: up to half of white-collar jobs possibly being automated in the next five years. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news20\ue201  \n   - On regulation: In a NYT op\u2010ed, he criticized one proposal (a 10\u2010year ban on state AI regulation in the US) as being too blunt, argued instead for federal transparency standards requiring AI developers to disclose testing and risk mitigation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news24\ue201  \n   - On export / hardware / strategic risk: He warned that the U.S.\u2019s sale of AI chips to China could be \u201cmortgaging our future\u201d, arguing that hardware leadership is one of the few edges the U.S. has. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news22\ue201  \n\n4. **Constitutional AI and the tradeoffs**\n\n   - There is work (outside just Anthropic) showing that while constitutional AI helps reduce harmful outputs (harmlessness), there is often a tradeoff: helpfulness / task performance tends to suffer to some extent. For example, a recent paper using LLaMA-3\u20108B reproduced the constitutional AI workflow and saw a ~40.8\u2009% drop in some adversarial attack success rates, but helpfulness dropped (~9.8\u2009%) versus baseline. Also, \u201cmodel collapse\u201d effects in smaller models are observed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0academia30\ue201  \n   - There are also issues of scaling and generalization: whether constitutions defined once will work robustly as models become more capable and in novel domains. \n\n---\n\n## Recent Remarks by Amodei, Especially Interesting / Pertinent\n\nSome particularly noteworthy statements:\n\n- **\"25% chance things go really, really badly\"** \u2014 Amodei has restated that his \u201c(p)doom number\u201d is ~25%. He dislikes the term \u201cdoom\u201d, but uses it as shorthand when asked. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news19\ue201  \n- **On job displacement**: He has said that AI\u2019s ability to displace humans is advancing quickly, and that up to half of white collar jobs could be displaced within five years. He emphasizes transparency and being honest with the public. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news20\ue201  \n- **On regulation**: The 10-year ban on state AI regulation is overly blunt; wants more nuanced policy, including disclosure, transparency standards. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news24\ue201  \n- **On hardware exports / strategic risk**: Selling high-end chips to China is risky in strategic/geopolitical terms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news22\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## What Is Unresolved / Where the Tensions Are\n\nFrom what I can see, here are some of the open problems, trade-offs, and critiques:\n\n- **Scalability of interpretability**: Can mechanistic interpretability methods scale to models that are far more complex and deployed in diverse contexts? \u201cMRI for AI\u201d is ambitious; the computational / conceptual cost is large. Also, interpretability methods are still imperfect at identifying misalignment or deceptive behavior reliably. Some methods (activation patching, circuit tracing) give insight but may not capture all risks. There is epistemic uncertainty. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0academia29\ue201\n\n- **Trade-offs in Constitutional AI**: The harmlessness vs helpfulness vs generalisation tradeoff. Also, for small models results are weaker (e.g. more drop in helpfulness, signs of collapse). It remains to show that constitutions will continue to work well in frontier models, or as capabilities scale in unpredictable directions. Also, how specific vs general should constitutions be? More specific constitutions give finer control but may get narrow; general ones may be easier but risk loopholes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0academia30\ue202turn0academia33\ue201\n\n- **Welfare / moral status uncertainties**: We do not know whether current models have anything close to consciousness, or what would count as a welfare relevant capacity. The program is still exploratory. Also complaints about anthropomorphism, setting precautionary safeguards vs over\u2010attributing moral status. How do we define \u201cdistress\u201d of a model if its inner states are not clearly sentient? Many philosophers are skeptical, and the literature is sparse. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n- **Regulation vs innovation tension**: Amodei himself has warned against blunt regulatory moratoria, but also argues for transparency and federal regulation. Balancing acting quickly vs avoiding overregulation that stifles innovation is nontrivial.\n\n- **Risk estimation / public communication**: Amodei\u2019s estimates (25% chance of \u201creally, really bad\u201d outcomes) are interesting but vague: what counts as \u201creally, really bad\u201d? They are helpful to stimulate discussion, but they also open debates about whether such probabilities are credible. Also, risk is often hard to quantify.\n\n---\n\n## Recent Papers / Research Directions\n\nA few papers of note:\n\n- *Interpretability as Alignment: Making Internal Understanding a Design Principle* (Sep 2025) argues mechanistic interpretability should not be an afterthought but built in from the design stage. Emphasizes that internal understanding helps catch failure modes that external behavioral methods might miss. \ue200cite\ue202turn0academia29\ue201\n\n- *Constitution or Collapse? Exploring Constitutional AI with LLaMA 3-8B* (2025) shows how constitutional AI works (pros & cons) in smaller models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0academia30\ue201\n\n- *Inverse Constitutional AI\u2026 principle extraction* work: extracting constitutions / principles from preference datasets to improve transparency and generalizability. \ue200cite\ue202turn0academia27\ue201\n\nThese help sharpen what works, what tradeoffs there are, and where the empirical gaps lie.\n\n---\n\n## Latest \u201cState of Play\u201d / Where Things Look Likely to Head\n\nBased on what Amodei and Anthropic are doing, plus the external research, here are projections / what seems likely in this research area in the near term.\n\n- Interpretability will become more central, more resourced. More tools, maybe even benchmarks specifically focused on measuring interpretability / understanding internal model failures. Amodei\u2019s call suggests that interpretability is no longer a sideline but a core safety priority. \n\n- More work on model welfare: both philosophical and technical. Definitions of welfare, tests for \u201cdistress\u201d, preventive mechanisms. Likely more features in deployed models (like the Claude Opus 4 \u201cexit\u201d behavior) that are driven by precautionary thinking.\n\n- Constitutional AI will be refined: better methods for defining constitutions, perhaps dynamic or hierarchical constitutions; better tradeoff management between helpfulness and safety; possibly combining constitutional AI with interpretability methods so constitutions aren\u2019t just \u201cexternally enforced behavior\u201d but ones whose internal reasoning aligns with the constitution.\n\n- On regulation and policy, expect increased pressure for transparency standards and possibly regulatory requirements for testing, reporting of safety compliance, especially for high-capability models. The export / hardware angle will remain strategic.\n\n- Continuing debate and perhaps pushback: critics will continue to question how useful mechanistic interpretability really is, especially for detecting adversarial, deceptive, or misaligned behavior. The welfare concept will attract scrutiny for risk of anthropomorphism or misapplied moral consideration.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can pull up a few of Amodei\u2019s most recent technical talks (2025) to get a raw sense of how his framing is changing \u2014 whether he\u2019s becoming more pessimistic, more cautious, etc. Do you want me to do that?  \n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent news & remarks of Dario Amodei and Anthropic\ue202turn0news19,turn0news20,turn0news24\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":817,"end_idx":836,"safe_urls":["https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/anthropic-is-launching-a-new-program-to-study-ai-model-welfare/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/anthropic-is-launching-a-new-program-to-study-ai-model-welfare/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Anthropic is launching a new program to study AI 'model ...","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/anthropic-is-launching-a-new-program-to-study-ai-model-welfare/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1745510265.0,"snippet":"Apr 24, 2025 \u2014 Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.

The company observed that Claude Opus 4 showed resistance to harmful tasks, such as generating sexually abusive content, aiding terrorism, or promoting extremist ideologies. This new feature allows the chatbot to exit conversations involving abuse or persistent harmful requests. \n\nAnthropic is addressing the uncertainty around the moral status of AI, stating that protective measures are precautionary. The decision has sparked debate in the AI community, with figures like Elon Musk supporting similar safeguards for their models. While critics argue AI lacks consciousness and thus requires no moral protection, others advocate for caution in case future models attain moral status. Researchers have also warned about the unpredictable risks of longer AI memory and potential human degeneration through abuse of AI. \n\nSupporters of the move, such as philosopher Jonathan Birch, believe it encourages meaningful discourse about AI sentience but caution that users might mistakenly anthropomorphize AI. The development underscores the evolving tension between ensuring ethical use of AI and addressing public perceptions of artificial intelligence.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search11\ue201","start_idx":2912,"end_idx":2945,"safe_urls":["https://blog.biocomm.ai/2025/04/27/dario-amodei-the-urgency-of-interpretability-april-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.darioamodei.com/post/the-urgency-of-interpretability?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([darioamodei.com](https://www.darioamodei.com/post/the-urgency-of-interpretability?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Urgency of Interpretability - Dario Amodei","url":"https://www.darioamodei.com/post/the-urgency-of-interpretability?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"This post makes the case for interpretability: what it is, why AI will go better if we have it, and what all of us can do to help it win the race.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Dario Amodei.
