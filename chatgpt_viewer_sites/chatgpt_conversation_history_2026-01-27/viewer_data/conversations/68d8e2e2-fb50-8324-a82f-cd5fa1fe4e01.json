The first half of the 20th century was amongst the bloodiest periods known to mankind. However, the victors of World War II were most unusual. Instead of collecting the spoils and imposing their wills on the vanquished, they decided that it was in their own enlightened self-interest to build and underwrite a system where sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and the political independence of each nation, big or small, would be protected; where the interactions of states in security, trade, and development were founded on a set of commonly agreed rules, international law, and trust. The ultimate goals were peace, prosperity, and progress for all. And the centerpiece of this was the United Nations and the UN Charter. The UN Charter provided the framework to govern the interactions between sovereign states. The International Court of Justice stood as the principal judicial organ of the UN, offering states a forum to settle disputes under the rule of law, peacefully.\r\n\r\nFor small states, it was a world that operated on principles and international law, where might did not make right. The stability and predictability offered by this system allowed all countries to develop their economies, to leverage one another's strengths, and to accelerate development. There was unparalleled dissemination of technology, of ideas, and of intellectual property. Trade grew significantly, and companies built global supply chains based on the principle of comparative advantage and efficiency. And Singapore is a tiny city-state in the heart of Southeast Asia, a small and open economy. We rode on these megatrends. That is why, in 60 years, a hardworking and disciplined people have built our per capita GDP from US$500 in 1965 to around US$85,000 today.\r\n\r\nThis multilateral system, founded on international law, also helped us to manage the global commons. For instance, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. It grants freedom of navigation and overflight as a universal right, crucial for an island city-state like Singapore, which depends on trade. It also provides the foundation for coordinating global efforts on sea-level rise, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. Meanwhile, specialized UN agencies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization set common rules and standards to enhance the safety and the efficiency of all these essential arteries.\r\n\r\nOf course, the system was not perfect. The rules were not always applied equally, and international law was not always respected. But nevertheless, there was a clear framework, and people and states knew what was right and what was wrong. The first few decades after 1945 were marked by decolonization and the expansion of the membership of the UN. The Cold War spawned several proxy wars around the world, including some in our region. But thankfully, as a world we avoided another world war between superpowers, and mutually assured destruction deterred the use of nuclear weapons, although we all know there were a few close shaves. For small, newly independent states\u2014and especially for those of us who were able to achieve national cohesion and effective governance\u2014the last 80 years, on the whole, was a favorable period of peace, prosperity, and progress.\r\n\r\n### The End of the Old Order and Current Conflicts\r\n\r\nMadame President, excellencies, however, the post\u2013World War order that I have just described has come to an end. The current distribution of economic weight, of technological sophistication, and of military strength today is very different from the world of 1945. And it is obvious that the UN and the other international organizations have not evolved to keep up with the times. Add another factor: the primary underwriters of the old world order have now decided to take a more transactional, narrower view of their national interest, and are less willing to provide public goods. And the sharper strategic contest between superpowers has also made them less able to cooperate, less able to underwrite, less able to manage the global commons.\r\n\r\nConsequently, today the world has become more turbulent, more uncertain, and, in some places, more violent. The erosion of respect for the principles of the UN Charter, the egregious violations of international law and of international humanitarian law have unfortunately become more common, as have violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The current wars which we all witness in the Middle East, in Ukraine, and parts of Africa reflect this tragedy. In all conflict zones, too many innocent lives are lost. Preventable famines occur and impunity abounds.\r\n\r\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire and shocking. Singapore hopes there will be an immediate ceasefire, an immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and for immediate access to humanitarian aid, food, and medical care for the civilians in Gaza. Singapore will recognize the state of Palestine when it has an effective government that accepts Israel's right to exist and categorically renounces terrorism. Singapore cannot recognize any unilateral annexation of occupied territory, because this would be a flagrant breach of international law. And if the situation continues to deteriorate, or if Israel takes further steps to extinguish a two-state solution, we will then have to reconsider our position on when to recognize a Palestinian state. In Ukraine, a permanent member of the Security Council has to comply with the UN Charter. And we must not forget the victims in Sudan and other conflict zones throughout the world.\r\n\r\n### Geopolitical Shifts and Strains on Multilateral Trade and Collective Action\r\n\r\nMadame President, excellencies, these geopolitical shifts have also disrupted the multilateral trading and economic system. Decades of progressive trade liberalization and investments expanded opportunities and prosperity all over the globe. But today those are at risk. Tariffs and export controls are being used as levers to secure unilateral advantage, including, sometimes, to address non-trade-related issues. The repudiation of the principle of most-favored-nation\u2014which is a cornerstone of the WTO and GATT systems\u2014erodes a transparent, rules-based multilateral system, giving way to a system where trade agreements approximate bilateral arm-wrestling matches. It is obvious that this will be to the detriment of small and trade-dependent states everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn such a fragmented world, we risk compounding the tragedy of the commons because collective action for long-term good becomes even more elusive. And climate change and pandemics are existential problems that no single country can resolve on its own. And if I may add, all of us need to base our decisions on scientific evidence and a commitment to fairness, both to current and future generations.\r\n\r\n### Recommitting to Multilateralism and Recent Successes\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this prevailing pessimism, Singapore believes that the multilateral system and international law, underpinned by the UN, still remain the best way to uphold global peace and prosperity in a fair and inclusive way. As a small state, we cannot afford to be passive or fatalistic and pessimistic. In fact, we are here to call on all of us to double down on multilateralism founded on international law. Even small states and middle powers have agency, and we have strategic autonomy to collectively protect our long-term national interests and the global commons. And Singapore will support the UN process to strengthen this institution and the multilateral system.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the multilateral system still works. And let me cite a few success stories. The BBNJ Agreement will enter into force on 17 January 2026. Earlier this week, we exceeded the 60 ratifications necessary to bring it into force. It is a legally binding treaty to conserve and to sustainably use marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. And we congratulate Ambassador for International Law Rena Lee from Singapore, who presided over these very difficult negotiations that led, ultimately, to a consensus\u2014emphasize the word consensus\u2014adoption of the historic BBNJ Agreement in June 2023.\r\n\r\nIn July, to cite another example, we achieved consensus on the final report of the Open-Ended Working Group on cybersecurity, which strengthened the normative framework for responsible state behavior in cybersecurity. We also agreed to establish the global mechanism on cybersecurity as a permanent home for this work at the UN. Mr. Burhan Gafoor, our Permanent Representative of Singapore to the UN, had the honor and the burden of chairing this Open-Ended Working Group over the past five years.\r\n\r\nTo give you a third example, in 2024, two World Intellectual Property Organization treaties\u2014the treaty on intellectual property, genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and the Design Law Treaty\u2014were concluded under the leadership of Mr. Darren Tang. These three examples demonstrate that, even in these fractured, fractious times, it is possible to come together to manage our global commons and to achieve agreement and consensus. Now, this does not mean that we will always reach agreement on every issue. But it is vital that the UN remains an arena for continued dialogue and discussions so that compromises can be reached, solutions can be found for even the most hotly contested issues.\r\n\r\n### Upholding International Law: Singapore\u2019s ICJ Nomination\r\n\r\nThe key to the multilateral system for small states is international law. And on this note, I am proud to share that Singapore will nominate Ambassador Rena Lee as a candidate for the International Court of Justice, which is the principal judicial organ of the UN. Our nomination underscores Singapore's deep commitment to upholding international law and support for the ICJ. If elected, Ambassador Lee will be only the second person and, in fact, the first woman from Southeast Asia to serve on this Court.\r\n\r\n### Reforming the UN to Be Fit for Purpose\r\n\r\nMadame President, excellencies, just as the world has changed dramatically in the last 80 years, it is also clear that the UN needs to reform to be fit for purpose for the next stretch. We need a more representative and a more inclusive UN that reflects current realities. The UN Charter confers on the UN Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It clearly needs reform to better fulfill this mandate. The increasing\u2014and, if I may add, cynical\u2014use of vetoes by the P5 must be constrained, and the wider UN membership must reach agreement on how this veto is to be exercised in the future. We commend the role played by the elected members of the Council, which gives the wider membership of the UN greater agency in addressing the pressing issues of the day. We also believe it is important to strengthen the relationship between the Security Council and the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nWe need a UN that delivers for real people on the ground: clean water, education, pandemic preparedness, social mobility, jobs, education, and an international financial architecture that delivers stability and prospects of progress for all. These are the building blocks for sustainable development and human dignity. The commitments made at the Summit of the Future last year signal our collective resolve to implement the SDGs. The UN needs to be future-ready and to harness the potential of emerging technologies like AI as a force for good for all. Early, constructive, and inclusive multilateral engagement is essential, and AI's transformative force can aid conflict prevention, peacekeeping, and humanitarian operations. But you all know there are also downsides and dangers, and it requires guardrails so that it can be harnessed responsibly.\r\n\r\n### Closing: Faith in the United Nations\r\n\r\nMadame President, excellencies, the first foreign minister of Singapore said it best 60 years ago in 1965: \u201cDespite cynics who focus attention on its many shortcomings, Singapore has faith in the future of the United Nations simply because, without it, there is no worthwhile future for humanity.\u201d These words still ring true today. So together, let us ensure that this institution continues to serve as humanity's best hope for peace and prosperity for all of us. Thank you, excellencies."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"986181a8eb89a5d8-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"73acfeb9-b2d5-4a08-97e9-d0d6d3574ca8","children":["6c9850db-a768-408b-82ae-85b73a3ab0de"]},"6c9850db-a768-408b-82ae-85b73a3ab0de":{"id":"6c9850db-a768-408b-82ae-85b73a3ab0de","message":{"id":"6c9850db-a768-408b-82ae-85b73a3ab0de","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759044325.2089744,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"986181a8eb89a5d8-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"246f08f4-1655-4191-b817-5e1b05b7beb2","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"246f08f4-1655-4191-b817-5e1b05b7beb2","children":["cf6b829f-0dad-41a1-ada1-2703347fb992"]},"cf6b829f-0dad-41a1-ada1-2703347fb992":{"id":"cf6b829f-0dad-41a1-ada1-2703347fb992","message":{"id":"cf6b829f-0dad-41a1-ada1-2703347fb992","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759044327.4334958,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"986181a8eb89a5d8-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"6c9850db-a768-408b-82ae-85b73a3ab0de","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6c9850db-a768-408b-82ae-85b73a3ab0de","children":["8dd6c26a-d787-4890-a93a-b734df645a93"]},"8dd6c26a-d787-4890-a93a-b734df645a93":{"id":"8dd6c26a-d787-4890-a93a-b734df645a93","message":{"id":"8dd6c26a-d787-4890-a93a-b734df645a93","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759044327.646528,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Critiquing Singapore's Speech at UNGA","content":"The user likely expects a comprehensive, balanced critique of Singapore's speech at the UNGA, focusing on its strengths, weaknesses, and consistency with their foreign policy.

to sanction Israeli settler leaders, supports Palestine statehood","snippet":"On September 22, 2025, Singapore announced plans to impose targeted sanctions on leaders of Israeli settler groups and expressed its willingness to recognize a Palestinian state under the right circumstances. In a parliamentary statement, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan criticized Israeli politicians for supporting annexation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza, and condemned ongoing settlement expansion such as the E1 project, asserting that it fragments Palestinian territories and undermines the viability of a two-state solution.\n\nSingapore\u2019s stance aligns with a broader international trend of opposition to Israeli settlements, widely considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Balakrishnan emphasized that Singapore's recognition of Palestinian statehood is inevitable, but dependent on conditions like the emergence of a capable Palestinian government that acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to exist and renounces terrorism. Despite close diplomatic and military ties with Israel since 1965, Singapore supported U.N. resolutions in 2024 favoring Palestinian statehood. The country is advocating for a peaceful, negotiated two-state solution ensuring security and dignity for both peoples. Details of the sanctions are expected to be released later.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758546968.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/reactions-growing-recognition-palestinian-state-2025-09-22/","title":"Reactions to growing recognition of a Palestinian state","snippet":"At a 2025 summit in New York convened by France and Saudi Arabia, several world leaders expressed support for formally recognizing a Palestinian state, sparking global debate. France\u2019s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot framed the move as isolating Hamas and reinforcing a peaceful two-state solution. Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide warned that while support for the two-state solution is growing, the situation in Gaza and the West Bank is dire due to violence and settlement expansion. UAE envoy Lana Nusseibeh emphasized continued backing for the Abraham Accords and an urgent need to end the war, especially due to humanitarian losses in Gaza. Russia reiterated its support for a two-state solution, calling the conflict at its most tragic stage. Singapore urged Israel to halt settlement expansion and pursue peace. However, Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Netanyahu and UN Ambassador Danny Danon, condemned the recognition, claiming it rewards terrorism and undermines security. In contrast, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed recent recognition from countries like the UK, Canada, and Australia, advocating peaceful coexistence between Palestinian and Israeli states.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758551772.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/b0248bcc-67ba-4c2e-86e0-8e14eeccf82e","title":"High Seas treaty looms over deep-ocean mining plans","snippet":"A newly ratified High Seas treaty, set to become international law in January 2026 after surpassing 60 ratifications with Morocco's support, is intensifying scrutiny over deep-sea mining. The treaty emphasizes a precautionary approach to seabed activities and aims to establish protected zones covering nearly a third of the world\u2019s international waters. It also mandates equitable distribution of profits derived from marine genetic resources. Although the U.S. has signed the treaty, it has not ratified it and has proposed issuing mining licenses without UN approval, raising concerns among environmental advocates. The treaty\u2019s implementation is seen as timely amid escalating threats from mining, overfishing, climate change, and pollution. France, a G7 member and treaty signatory, is strongly promoting a coalition against deep-sea mining. While not explicitly banning mining, the treaty promotes cooperation with the International Seabed Authority, which has yet to approve mining efforts. The treaty\u2019s ratification is expected to support broader climate initiatives, including those aimed at marine ecosystem restoration and decarbonizing maritime industries. It will take a central role in upcoming UN climate discussions in New York and Brazil.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758466451.769,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"highseasalliance.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://highseasalliance.org/2025/09/19/historic-milestone-for-global-ocean-protection-60th-ratification-triggers-entry-into-force-of-high-seas-treaty/","title":"60th ratification triggers entry into force of High Seas Treaty","snippet":"Sep 19, 2025 \u2014 HISTORIC MILESTONE FOR GLOBAL OCEAN PROTECTION: 60th ratification triggers entry into force of High Seas Treaty.

The treaty emphasizes a precautionary approach to seabed activities and aims to establish protected zones covering nearly a third of the world\u2019s international waters. It also mandates equitable distribution of profits derived from marine genetic resources. Although the U.S. has signed the treaty, it has not ratified it and has proposed issuing mining licenses without UN approval, raising concerns among environmental advocates. The treaty\u2019s implementation is seen as timely amid escalating threats from mining, overfishing, climate change, and pollution. France, a G7 member and treaty signatory, is strongly promoting a coalition against deep-sea mining. While not explicitly banning mining, the treaty promotes cooperation with the International Seabed Authority, which has yet to approve mining efforts. The treaty\u2019s ratification is expected to support broader climate initiatives, including those aimed at marine ecosystem restoration and decarbonizing maritime industries.

Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide warned that while support for the two-state solution is growing, the situation in Gaza and the West Bank is dire due to violence and settlement expansion. UAE envoy Lana Nusseibeh emphasized continued backing for the Abraham Accords and an urgent need to end the war, especially due to humanitarian losses in Gaza. Russia reiterated its support for a two-state solution, calling the conflict at its most tragic stage. Singapore urged Israel to halt settlement expansion and pursue peace. However, Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Netanyahu and UN Ambassador Danny Danon, condemned the recognition, claiming it rewards terrorism and undermines security.

The share of global trade conducted under WTO's 'most favoured nation' (MFN) terms has dropped from about 80% to 72%, and could decrease further. This decline marks the most significant disruption to the global trading system in 80 years. Okonjo-Iweala emphasized the ongoing value of the MFN principle but acknowledged growing concerns about the predictability of the global trading system. The WTO has revised its global trade growth forecast upward from 0.2% to 0.9% due to strong early-year activity, but the Director-General cautioned that the full impact of tariffs may manifest in 2026 as current inventories are depleted.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":8176,"end_idx":8176,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"High Seas treaty looms over deep-ocean mining plans","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/b0248bcc-67ba-4c2e-86e0-8e14eeccf82e?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Financial Times"},{"title":"10 July 2025 Excellency, I have the honour of addressing ...","url":"https://docs-library.unoda.org/Open-Ended_Working_Group_on_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_-_%282021%29/Letter_from_OEWG_Chair_10_July_2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"UNODA Docs Library"},{"title":"WIPO Member States Adopt Historic New Treaty on ...","url":"https://www.wipo.int/web/igc/w/news/2024/wipo-member-states-adopt-historic-new-treaty-on-intellectual-property-genetic-resources-and-associated-traditional-knowledge?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"WIPO"},{"title":"ICJ Candidate Rena Lee","url":"https://icj-candidate-rena-lee.mfa.gov.sg/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"icj-candidate-rena-lee.mfa.gov.sg"},{"title":"Singapore to sanction Israeli settler leaders, supports Palestine statehood","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-sanction-israeli-settler-leaders-supports-palestine-statehood-2025-09-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Appellate Body -

French President Emmanuel Macron's declaration was met with strong applause at the U.N. General Assembly, joining a growing list of nations\u2014including the U.K., Canada, Australia, Portugal, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and Monaco\u2014that have recently recognized a Palestinian state. However, countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan participated in the meeting without extending such recognition.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reaffirmed that Palestinian statehood is a right, not a reward, directly challenging Israeli arguments that recognition legitimizes Hamas. Amid pressure and conflict, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, speaking remotely after the U.S. revoked his visa, called for an end to violence and offered reforms, including changes to controversial social payments. The Palestinian Authority, widely criticized by some Palestinians, faces political rivalry with Hamas and limited control.\n\nDespite growing global support\u2014around three-quarters of U.N. member states now recognize Palestine\u2014the Israeli government remains firmly opposed, threatening annexation of parts of the West Bank.

This recognition significantly increased following announcements during the United Nations General Assembly in New York. On that day, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and Andorra declared recognition of Palestine, following similar decisions the previous day by the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Portugal. Earlier in 2024, Armenia and Slovenia, as well as Spain, Ireland, and Norway, had also extended recognition, largely motivated by efforts to revive peace negotiations amid the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in over 55,000 deaths.\n\nHistorically, Palestine declared independence in 1988 through the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), prompting recognition from 82 countries, mainly from Africa, the Middle East, and the former Soviet bloc. Major support came from South America in the early 2010s. Despite wide recognition, the European Union remains divided, with Sweden being the first EU member to recognize Palestine in 2014. Palestine holds non-member observer status at the UN since 2012, allowing limited participation but not full membership or voting rights.

Others support the recognition, pointing to historic parallels with Israel\u2019s founding and asserting it as a necessary moral stance amid alleged Israeli aggression in Gaza and the West Bank. Some letters question the political motivations behind Starmer\u2019s decision, while others boldly defend it as a symbolic but crucial step toward justice and diplomacy.\n\nThe letters also touch on unrelated topics: the decline of modern language education in British schools, the historic contribution of Polish air force squadrons during WWII, reflections on devolution in Scotland, the state of entrepreneurship and risk in the UK, aging, death-related euphemisms, speeding control technologies, seasonal reflection, territorial sensitivities in Scotland, and humor about political figures.

Foreign Minister Winston Peters voiced concerns that recognition could make ceasefire efforts more difficult by entrenching hardened positions on both sides. Israel's Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Sharren Haskel praised New Zealand for what she called a display of common sense and moral courage. In contrast, Australia has come under scrutiny for a different approach. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke received criticism for personally welcoming about 40 to 50 Palestinian refugees from Gaza at Sydney Airport, with some questioning the government\u2019s character screening process. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry expressed disappointment, comparing Australia unfavorably to countries like New Zealand, Belgium, Singapore, and Argentina, which have adopted more cautious stances toward Palestinian recognition.

Sheikh Abdullah emphasized the UAE\u2019s continued commitment to peace efforts based on a two-state solution.\n\nThe UAE, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 under the Abraham Accords, has recently expressed concern about Israeli policies, warning that further annexation in the occupied West Bank could jeopardize diplomatic ties. Strained relations come amid intensifying conflict in Gaza and growing international frustration. Several Western nations recently recognized a Palestinian state, a move condemned by Netanyahu, who opposes the creation of such a state.

The sentiment among many young Israelis surveyed in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem is largely skeptical and distrusting. The trauma of the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, which killed 1,200 people and led to the taking of over 250 hostages, remains a powerful influence on public opinion. Many see recognition of Palestine as a premature reward for Hamas, which still holds hostages and has not agreed to disarm.\n\nSupport for a two-state solution has sharply declined, dropping from around 37% before the attacks to 25-30%. Some liberal voices, like former pilot Guy Poran and student Noga Rothman, advocate for peace and change, but they are in the minority. Others, particularly in more religious areas like Jerusalem, express distrust and hostility toward such proposals. While there's theoretical openness to a Palestinian state if it\u2019s divorced from Hamas, widespread fear and trauma dominate the public mood, with many seeing international recognition as ill-timed and harmful. As a result, the prospect of a two-state resolution appears distant amid ongoing conflict and mistrust.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758992400.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-says-it-will-not-recognise-palestinian-state-this-time-2025-09-27/","title":"New Zealand says it will not recognise Palestinian state at this time","snippet":"As of September 27, 2025, New Zealand has decided not to recognize a Palestinian state at this time, according to Foreign Minister Winston Peters. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Peters cited ongoing conflict, Hamas's control of Gaza, and the lack of clear future plans as reasons for caution. He expressed concerns that premature recognition might further entrench the positions of both Israel and Hamas, complicating efforts to achieve a ceasefire.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon emphasized that recognition is a matter of \"when, not if,\" indicating that New Zealand remains committed to a two-state solution but is waiting for a more conducive environment for peace. This decision contrasts with the recent recognition of Palestinian statehood by traditional allies like Australia, Canada, and the UK, aligning them with over 140 countries supporting Palestinian aspirations for statehood.\n\nNew Zealand's opposition Labour Party criticized the move, calling it a missed opportunity and asserting that recognition is essential for genuine peace.

Albares emphasized the recent wave of countries recognizing Palestine \u2013 including France, Belgium, and the UK \u2013 and reaffirmed Spain\u2019s support for a two-state solution. Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, recognized Palestine in 2024, and Albares predicted further international recognition would push the peace process forward.\n\nSpain has taken a tough stance against Israeli military actions in Gaza, branding the prolonged conflict as unacceptable and labeling it a humanitarian crisis. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez recently called the war \u201ca genocide\u201d and announced measures such as an arms embargo and restrictions on Israeli-bound fuel shipments. These moves sparked diplomatic tensions, including mutual ministerial bans and accusations from Israel of antisemitism.\n\nAlbares also addressed Spain\u2019s defense spending, defending the country\u2019s decision not to meet former U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for 5% GDP defense expenditure, highlighting Spain\u2019s role in Europe\u2019s security with current spending at 2.1%.

Critics argue the move is premature and undermines peace negotiations, citing the lack of a functioning government or defined territory in Palestine, particularly Gaza, and warning it could legitimize terrorism.

The decision precedes the UN General Assembly and aligns with similar recognitions from Canada and Australia. Starmer emphasized that the move is not a reward for Hamas and affirmed that Hamas would have no role in a future Palestinian government, with UK sanctions targeting its leaders. The recognition is based on 1967 borders and paves the way for full diplomatic relations.\n\nThe Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, strongly condemned the decision, calling it destabilizing. Despite criticism from allies such as the U.S. and Israel, Starmer defended the recognition as a response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and a pushback against Israel\u2019s ongoing military campaign and occupation. The move also responds to internal political pressure within the Labour Party. Over 150 countries are expected to recognize Palestine, though the U.S. remains opposed. The UK government insists this step is a moral imperative and a commitment to peace, despite its limited immediate impact on the ground.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758539892.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/netanyahu-uk-palestinian-recogniton-absurd-prize-terrorism","title":"Netanyahu calls UK's Palestine recognition 'absurd prize for terrorism'","snippet":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu harshly criticized the UK's decision to recognize a Palestinian state, calling it \"an absurd prize for terrorism.\" He stated that this move rewards the jihadist group Hamas, which carried out the deadly October 7, 2023, attack that killed around 1,200 people. Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry echoed this view, arguing the UK\u2019s action legitimizes terror and undermines regional security. Israeli officials fear such recognition empowers Hamas politically.\n\nCriticism also came from within Israel, with opposition figure Yair Golan blaming Netanyahu and his far-right partners for the diplomatic fallout, warning it endangers Israeli security and leverage in future negotiations. Meanwhile, calls in Israel grow for a negotiated end to the Gaza conflict, as public support for Netanyahu\u2019s hardline coalition wanes. Tens of thousands protested over the weekend, demanding action to free the 48 hostages still held by Hamas.\n\nFar-right ministers like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have responded by advocating for annexation of the occupied West Bank, rejecting any recognition of Palestinian statehood. Analysts expect Netanyahu to finalize Israel's response after a forthcoming U.S. visit.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758475051.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-formally-recognises-palestinian-state","title":"UK formally recognises Palestinian State","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 The UK has formally recognised Palestine to protect the viability of a two-state solution and create a path towards lasting peace for the ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758409200.0,"attribution":"www.gov.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-the-recognition-of-palestine-21-september-2025","title":"PM statement on the recognition of Palestine","snippet":"7 days ago \u2014 PM statement on the recognition of Palestine: 21 September 2025 ...

Here\u2019s a cleaner, evidence-based cut.\n\n# 1) What recent recognitions are (and aren\u2019t)\n- **Stated intent (from the recognizers):** The UK, Canada and Australia all framed recognition as a step to *preserve* a two-state outcome and to anchor Palestinian self-determination\u2014not as a sanction. Read the UK\u2019s official line: recognition is to \u201cprotect the viability of a two-state solution,\u201d with Hamas excluded from governance and hostages to be released. Canada and Australia used near-identical language. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- **Yes, it also signals disapproval of Israeli policy.** That\u2019s unavoidable\u2014recognition arrived amid the Gaza war and ongoing settlement expansion, and leaders said so explicitly. It\u2019s pressure by *legitimizing the end-state* rather than by punishing per se. Reuters/AP coverage is unambiguous that the wave was coordinated and timed to UNGA. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search11\ue202turn1search6\ue201  \n- **Not just \u201cperformative\u201d:** Recognition enables embassies, treaty relations, and clearer legal standing in bilateral dealings. It doesn\u2019t conjure sovereignty on the ground\u2014but it *does* shift the diplomatic baseline. (That\u2019s why Israel\u2019s government condemned it so sharply.) \ue200cite\ue202turn3search11\ue201\n\n# 2) \u201cPalestinians have rejected a two-state solution\u201d \u2014 the record is mixed, not absolute\n- **Official Palestinian position (PLO/PA):** Since 1988 the PLO accepted UNSC 242/338 and declared a state on the 1967 lines\u2014i.e., the two-state track. Whatever one thinks about PA performance, its formal stance remains two states. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search3\ue202turn4search5\ue201  \n- **Public opinion:** After October 7, attitudes swung violently on both sides\u2014but recent Palestinian polling (May 2025) shows **plurality support** for a two-state outcome *when specified on 1967 borders* (\u224847% overall; West Bank 46%, Gaza 48%). Other PCPSR series show support fluctuating around 40% depending on wording and timing. That\u2019s not a blanket \u201crejection.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search4\ue201  \n- **Hamas \u2260 all Palestinians:** Hamas still refuses to recognize Israel, but its 2017 \u201cpolitical document\u201d explicitly accepted a state on 1967 lines as a \u201cnational consensus\u201d position (without recognition of Israel). That\u2019s not endorsement of two states, but it\u2019s not the same as categorical rejection either. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- **Israeli side for context:** Israeli support for a two-state outcome has also cratered since Oct 2023; surveys show low confidence that coexistence is possible (Pew, June 2025) and only minorities of Jewish Israelis backing a two-state pathway (IDI tracking). Meanwhile, the current Israeli government openly rejects a Palestinian state. The polarization runs both ways. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search10\ue201\n\n# 3) Is recognition \u201ccowardly\u201d or consequential?\n**Steelman your claim:**  \n- Recognition came *late*, after years of settlement growth; many capitals paired it with few concrete sticks. Absent enforcement (arms embargoes, settlement-related measures, legal follow-through), it risks symbolism over substance. Fair critique. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news21\ue201\n\n**Counterpoint:**  \n- It **changes the diplomatic grammar**: countries now speak to \u201cthe State of Palestine,\u201d can sign state-to-state agreements, and can align development, policing and reform programs with state-building benchmarks. That empowers non-Hamas actors and clarifies what \u201cendgame\u201d moderates are working toward. (This is exactly how the UK, Canada, Australia and others defended the move.) \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- It **widens legal avenues**: recognition can ease treaty access and jurisdictional hooks for state-to-state mechanisms and supervision\u2014notably alongside the UNGA\u2019s 2024 upgrade of Palestine\u2019s observer-state privileges and its push for full UN membership. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n- And it **sets a political cost** for permanent occupation/annexation logic: isolating that outcome isn\u2019t \u201ccowardly,\u201d it\u2019s a coherent\u2014if belated\u2014use of diplomatic leverage.\n\n# 4) How to tell if recognition is merely performative (6\u201318 month yardsticks)\n1) **Embassy & staffing:** Do recognizers open an embassy (or upgraded mission) in Ramallah/East Jerusalem with a real program budget?  \n2) **Treaties & aid conditionality:** Do they sign bilateral agreements (trade, policing, anti-corruption) with measurable reform conditions on the PA?  \n3) **Differentiation/enforcement:** Do they operationalize settlement differentiation (e.g., procurement guidance, customs codes) or arms export restrictions where law requires?  \n4) **Support for UN tracks:** Do they back UN membership steps procedurally and fund rule-of-law institutions (courts, audit bodies) in the West Bank/Gaza governance transition?  \n5) **Humanitarian \u2192 recovery bridge:** Do they move money from emergency aid to **infrastructure and governance** under a Hamas-free administration?\n\nIf these move, recognition is **instrumental**; if not, your \u201cperformative\u201d label sticks.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n- Much of the new recognition wave is framed\u2014explicitly\u2014around *Palestinian self-determination via two states*, not \u201cpunishing Israel.\u201d It *does* apply pressure on Israeli policy, but that\u2019s a feature, not the only motive. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search11\ue201  \n- The claim that \u201cPalestinians have rejected two states\u201d doesn\u2019t hold across institutions or polling.

Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, recognized Palestine in 2024, and Albares predicted further international recognition would push the peace process forward.\n\nSpain has taken a tough stance against Israeli military actions in Gaza, branding the prolonged conflict as unacceptable and labeling it a humanitarian crisis. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez recently called the war \u201ca genocide\u201d and announced measures such as an arms embargo and restrictions on Israeli-bound fuel shipments. These moves sparked diplomatic tensions, including mutual ministerial bans and accusations from Israel of antisemitism.\n\nAlbares also addressed Spain\u2019s defense spending, defending the country\u2019s decision not to meet former U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for 5% GDP defense expenditure, highlighting Spain\u2019s role in Europe\u2019s security with current spending at 2.1%.

Referring to a two-state solution as \"sheer madness,\" Netanyahu compared advocating Palestinian sovereignty near Jerusalem to giving al-Qaeda a state near New York after 9/11. His remarks came days after several Western nations, including the UK, France, Canada, and Australia, joined 157 UN members in recognizing a Palestinian state, breaking with the U.S. position.\n\nOver 100 diplomats exited the UN hall in protest as Netanyahu arrived. He faced strong criticism for continuing military operations in Gaza, where dozens of Palestinians were killed on the day of his address. Netanyahu dismissed genocide allegations, claiming Israel urges civilians to avoid harm and emphasized the aim to eliminate Hamas fighters in Gaza City.\n\nNotably absent from the speech was any mention of potential annexation of the West Bank, a move championed by his right-wing allies and opposed by Donald Trump. Netanyahu also issued an ultimatum to Hamas: surrender and release hostages or face further action. The speech, delivered to a sparse audience, drew large protests outside in New York.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758904818.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/88f3a87f7d79df02311f09b3e45560e9","title":"France recognizes Palestinian statehood at UN meeting to revive peace efforts","snippet":"At a high-level United Nations meeting held in Tanzania, France announced its official recognition of Palestinian statehood, marking a significant shift in international diplomacy amid ongoing conflict in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron's declaration was met with strong applause at the U.N. General Assembly, joining a growing list of nations\u2014including the U.K., Canada, Australia, Portugal, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and Monaco\u2014that have recently recognized a Palestinian state. However, countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan participated in the meeting without extending such recognition.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reaffirmed that Palestinian statehood is a right, not a reward, directly challenging Israeli arguments that recognition legitimizes Hamas. Amid pressure and conflict, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, speaking remotely after the U.S. revoked his visa, called for an end to violence and offered reforms, including changes to controversial social payments. The Palestinian Authority, widely criticized by some Palestinians, faces political rivalry with Hamas and limited control.\n\nDespite growing global support\u2014around three-quarters of U.N. member states now recognize Palestine\u2014the Israeli government remains firmly opposed, threatening annexation of parts of the West Bank. With peace talks stalled for over a decade, the international community continues to advocate for a two-state solution as the only viable path to long-term peace.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758557079.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine","title":"United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758474116.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Palestine","title":"International recognition of Palestine","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1759106415.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.pcpsr.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/997","title":"Press Release: Public Opinion Poll No (95)","snippet":"May 6, 2025 \u2014 Support for a Palestinian state rises to more than 60% when it is not linked to the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d and when the borders of the state are ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.pcpsr.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Poll%2095%20press%20release%206May2025%20ENGLISH.pdf","title":"Poll s","snippet":"May 6, 2025 \u2014 Support for the two-state solution: Support for the concept of the two-state solution remains stable, with 4 out of 10 Palestinians ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.pcpsr.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pcpsr.org/","title":"PCPSR: Home","snippet":"Support for the two-state solution remains unchanged but support for armed struggle drops ...

Israel in its war against Hamas, criticizing Labour PM Keir Starmer\u2019s recognition of a Palestinian state as a misguided and politically motivated gesture that rewards terrorism. Cohen, in an interview, stressed that Israel is battling Hamas alone despite global cooperation against other terrorist groups like ISIS and the Taliban. He pledged to eliminate all Hamas fighters in Gaza, portraying Israel\u2019s military actions as a just war aimed at neutralizing terror, not harming civilians.\n\nCohen accused Starmer of recognizing Palestinian statehood to appease domestic political factions rather than promote peace. He criticized the move, echoed by nations like France and Australia, as lacking legal legitimacy and undercutting the Oslo Accords, which require bilateral negotiation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHe also dismissed accusations of genocide and said Israel is doing its best to protect Gaza\u2019s civilians, though humanitarian concerns persist as casualties mount. Additionally, Cohen expressed support for a plan by former UK PM Tony Blair to govern Gaza temporarily post-conflict.

Israeli actions transform West Bank in shadow of Gaza war","snippet":"Israel is undergoing sweeping changes in the West Bank amid the Gaza conflict, advancing policies that aim to cement permanent control over the territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government has accelerated settlement expansion, legalized dozens of new outposts, and transferred administrative control to pro-settlement officials, notably Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The most transformative action includes the approval of the controversial E1 project, intended to connect Jerusalem to Ma\u2019ale Adumim, a move international critics say could block the territorial continuity of a future Palestinian state.\n\nThese developments, coupled with heightened settler violence and Israeli military operations in Palestinian areas like Tulkarm and Jenin, are systematically displacing thousands of Palestinians and fundamentally altering the region. The army has remained in areas previously under Palestinian Authority control, demolishing homes and reshaping refugee camps. Settler attacks\u2014often with apparent military complicity\u2014have surged, driving Palestinians from their land. Meanwhile, formal annexation of the West Bank is being considered despite widespread international opposition, including from Western governments that have recently recognized Palestinian statehood. These actions indicate an unprecedented Israeli drive to make its control over the West Bank irreversible, drastically impacting prospects for a two-state solution.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1759050035.346,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.lemonde.fr","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/09/22/israel-s-near-unanimous-rejection-of-the-recognition-of-palestine_6745624_4.html","title":"Israel's near-unanimous rejection of the recognition of Palestine","snippet":"In response to the recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK, Canada, Australia, Portugal, and France, Israel's political establishment has shown near-unanimous rejection across party lines. This recognition comes nearly two years after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, and is largely viewed in Israel as a symbolic move with dangerous implications. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the act as a reward for terrorism and reiterated his commitment to preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state west of the Jordan River. His government may accelerate settlement expansion in the West Bank and is considering diplomatic retaliation, such as expelling diplomats or asserting sovereignty over contested territories. Far-right leaders are pushing for the annexation of large parts of the West Bank and the dismantling of the Palestinian Authority. The opposition also aligns with the government's view, emphasizing the release of hostages held by Hamas as a prerequisite for any discussions on Palestinian statehood. As Israel approaches its 2026 elections, mainstream political figures remain opposed to a two-state solution, with public opinion similarly against it post-October 7.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758535205.0,"attribution":"www.lemonde.fr"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/f46ed742e69c2ad545b3544a1fb12b4f","title":"Spain's top diplomat dismisses Israeli leader's vow of no Palestinian state, saying it will happen","snippet":"In an interview at the United Nations, Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s vow against the creation of a Palestinian state, asserting that peace and coexistence are inevitable. Albares emphasized the recent wave of countries recognizing Palestine \u2013 including France, Belgium, and the UK \u2013 and reaffirmed Spain\u2019s support for a two-state solution. Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, recognized Palestine in 2024, and Albares predicted further international recognition would push the peace process forward.\n\nSpain has taken a tough stance against Israeli military actions in Gaza, branding the prolonged conflict as unacceptable and labeling it a humanitarian crisis. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez recently called the war \u201ca genocide\u201d and announced measures such as an arms embargo and restrictions on Israeli-bound fuel shipments. These moves sparked diplomatic tensions, including mutual ministerial bans and accusations from Israel of antisemitism.\n\nAlbares also addressed Spain\u2019s defense spending, defending the country\u2019s decision not to meet former U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for 5% GDP defense expenditure, highlighting Spain\u2019s role in Europe\u2019s security with current spending at 2.1%.

The proposed plan reportedly includes a 21-point framework which calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages held by Hamas within 48 hours, and a phased Israeli military withdrawal. Arab officials and Hamas confirmed they have been briefed but await formal proposals.\n\nNetanyahu reiterated his goal to dismantle Hamas, whose 2023 attack ignited the conflict. However, he expressed willingness to allow Hamas operatives to leave Gaza in exchange for an end to hostilities and hostage releases. Meanwhile, the war has taken a devastating toll, with over 66,000 Palestinians reported killed and around 168,000 wounded, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Amid escalating violence, international pressure, including potential EU sanctions and calls for boycott, has intensified against Israel.\n\nThe situation remains critical, with frequent Israeli airstrikes, massive displacement, infrastructure destruction, and famine in Gaza, alongside rising violence in the West Bank.

Israel did not respond directly to this request and continued advancing into densely populated districts. Humanitarian agencies and Gaza's health services indicated that rescue operations are hindered, with Israel reportedly denying multiple international requests for access.\n\nTrump's 21-point plan proposes the return of hostages, cessation of Israeli attacks on Qatar, and renewed Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. While Israeli and Arab leaders have responded positively to Trump\u2019s plan, Hamas stated it has yet to receive the proposal and reiterated its refusal to disarm or expel its leaders.

Netanyahu dismissed genocide allegations, claiming Israel urges civilians to avoid harm and emphasized the aim to eliminate Hamas fighters in Gaza City.\n\nNotably absent from the speech was any mention of potential annexation of the West Bank, a move championed by his right-wing allies and opposed by Donald Trump.

Pope Francis also met with local Catholics and urged them not to impose their faith on others.

Despite Indonesia's counterterrorism efforts, recidivism and radicalization in prisons remain significant issues. Critics argue that heavy-handed tactics by the counterterrorism force Densus 88 and poor deradicalization programs have contributed to the problem.

This follows the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act passed in October 2021, marking its first use to block social media content. Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs cited Guo and his organizations for spreading false narratives against national interests. Guo, a former Chinese real estate developer, fled China in 2014 amid an anti-corruption crackdown and was recently convicted in the U.S. for defrauding followers. Singapore's fourth Prime Minister, Lawrence Wong, was sworn in on May 15.

The UK's participation in the MPIA aligns with its updated trade strategy aimed at bolstering British businesses amid economic volatility and rising protectionism. With 56 members, including the EU, Canada, and Brazil, the MPIA serves as a temporary solution for handling WTO disputes.

The U.S. was expected to contribute about 11% of the WTO's 2024 budget, which totals 205 million Swiss francs.

Efforts to fix the system, inoperative since 2019 due to U.S. obstruction of Appellate Body judge appointments over concerns of judicial overreach, remain stalled. Additionally, the meeting did not yield fisheries agreements on excess fishing capacity and overfishing. Despite some progress, members are divided on the necessary structure for appeals.\n\nPagan noted a lack of U.S. willingness to change its stance on the Appellate Body, emphasizing the need for other members to take the U.S. position seriously. She declined to comment on any contact with Trump's transition team or offer advice to Trump's nominee Jamieson Greer, who previously assisted in imposing significant tariffs on Chinese goods and global metals. The broken appellate function has rendered WTO dispute rulings ineffective.

Marco Molina, the previous facilitator from Guatemala, was dismissed by his government, stalling progression. With no willing candidates from Botswana and Honduras, finding a replacement remains difficult. Agreements require unanimous consent from all 166 members, making negotiations challenging.

That creates both risks (spillover polarisation) and assets (trusted interlocutor to both sides). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n---\n\n# Twelve key areas to get right\n\n## 1) Anchor everything in multilateral law\u2014then operationalise it\n- **Lines to hold:** UN Charter, sovereign equality, territorial integrity, peaceful settlement; UNCLOS for navigation and straits; ICJ/ICC processes to apply consistently. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search14\ue201  \n- **Concrete actions:**  \n  - Support GA **veto-scrutiny** (Res. 76/262) and back **veto restraint** initiatives (French-Mexican; ACT Code) without making them anti-P5 projects.  \n  - Where the Council is jammed, use GA mechanisms and plurilateral groups to keep humanitarian/legal channels open. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue202turn2news56\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search4\ue201\n\n## 2) ASEAN-first execution\n- Keep **ASEAN centrality** in front: consult first, avoid solo megaphone diplomacy, and aim for workable lowest-common-denominator text when the region is split\u2014then add Singapore\u2019s national explanation of vote to preserve principle. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn2search1\ue201\n\n## 3) Calibrated positions on Israel\u2013Palestine (principled + sequenced)\n- **Principles:** condemn terror; insist on release of hostages; demand IHL compliance; keep two-state end-state viable; maintain ties with Israel **and** the PA; keep channels with key Arab capitals and the OIC.  \n- **Sequencing discipline:** state-building and security sector reform under a **non-Hamas** administration in parallel with humanitarian scale-up; recognition questions tied to objective governance and security benchmarks\u2014not to news-cycle pressure. (Use our humanitarian record to prove neutrality is not indifference.) \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search6\ue201\n\n## 4) Domestic social cohesion = national security\n- Use existing legal architecture **sparingly but visibly**:  \n  - **MRHA** (pre-empt sectarian incitement), **POFMA** (correct falsehoods), and **FICA** (disrupt foreign IOs/HICs).  \n  - Pair with transparent public comms (gov.sg/Factually) and community leadership (e.g., RRG) to avoid a purely coercive posture. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn4search1\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n- **Risk to watch:** over-correction (heavy-handed takedowns) can internationalise a local row and hand oxygen to foreign narratives; use **narrow, facts-specific** directions and publish reasons.\n\n## 5) Information environment & foreign interference\n- **Standing playbook:** rapid myth-busting (Factually), proportionate corrections (POFMA), and if origin is foreign/ coordinated, escalate to **FICA directions** on platforms. We\u2019ve already done this at scale; keep it procedural, not political. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn4news23\ue201\n\n## 6) Sanctions, export controls, finance hub risk\n- **Baseline:** implement UN measures; be extremely cautious with unilateral regimes\u2014but retain the option of **rare autonomous measures** where core norms are at stake (precedent: Russia 2022\u2014export controls + MAS financial notices). Keep guidance crystal-clear for FIs and traders. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn3search8\ue201  \n- **Strategic goods:** keep enforcement tight (SGCA) given our trans-shipment exposure. Run targeted outreach to freight forwarders and DPT/fintechs. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search7\ue201\n\n## 7) Trade-law realism (WTO) with minilateral ballast\n- The **WTO Appellate Body** remains non-functional; meanwhile Singapore is in the **MPIA**. Use it and help expand it, while backing DSU reform that restores two-tier adjudication. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6search5\ue201  \n- Regionally, build **ROO/digital** interoperability (CPTPP/RCEP) as a hedge against systemic drift.\n\n## 8) Maritime and aviation lifelines\n- Tie our UNCLOS message to specific deliverables: Straits navigation safety, green shipping corridors, IMO/ICAO standards, and readiness to implement the **BBNJ** treaty when it enters into force (Jan 17, 2026). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn5search2\ue201\n\n## 9) Counter-terrorism and radicalisation risk\n- Stay closely wired to Indonesia/Malaysia services; prioritise **prison and online** radicalisation vectors and travel screening. Leverage RRG for post-release aftercare and upstream messaging. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201\n\n## 10) Humanitarian credibility as strategic asset\n- Keep aid **needs-based, apolitical, and trackable** (SRC, RLAF, multilateral channels). Publicly report tranches, partners, and delivery routes; this inoculates the charge of partisanship. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search9\ue201\n\n## 11) Tech, cyber, and AI guardrails for conflict spillovers\n- Support the new **UN cyber mechanism** emerging from the OEWG (chaired by Singapore); propose concrete capacity-building for small states.  \n- Use **AI Verify** (IMDA/AI Verify Foundation) as a neutral template for \u201cresponsible AI\u201d in peacekeeping, humanitarian logistics, and online harms evaluation. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue202turn5search12\ue202turn5search1\ue201\n\n## 12) Crisis communications & diplomacy craft\n- **External:** avoid moral grandstanding; use **specific legal hooks** (hostages, civilians, settlements/IHL) and propose workable steps (e.g., monitored humanitarian corridors, hostage frameworks).  \n- **Internal:** repeat the triad\u2014**law, lives, long-term security**\u2014and stress that Singapore\u2019s positions are **for** our survival and cohesion, not a referendum on foreign politics.\n\n---\n\n# Practical guardrails & \u201cred lines\u201d\n- **UN undermining:** publicly support GA veto-scrutiny sessions and **veto restraint** in mass-atrocity contexts; call out attempts to bypass the UN where it harms small-state interests\u2014**but** pair with quiet bilateral demarches to limit diplomatic blowback. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n- **Domestic harmony:** zero tolerance for threats, doxxing, sectarian agitation; use MRHA/POFMA/FICA proportionately with published reasons and sunset reviews. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- **Economic coercion:** if partners seek extraterritorial compliance that materially harms our autonomy or hub status, escalate to plurilateral coordination (ASEAN+middle-powers) and seek tailored carve-outs\u2014while maintaining legal compliance for entities exposed to those jurisdictions.\n\n---\n\n# What to measure (so policy doesn\u2019t drift)\n- **Cohesion:** inter-communal incident rates, online-to-offline escalation, correction-notice acceptance rates.  \n- **Credibility:** uptake of Singapore-sponsored UN text/proposals; invitations to chair processes (as with OEWG). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search12\ue201  \n- **Economic risk:** sanctions/controls compliance incidents; trade flow resilience through PSA/Changi under stress.  \n- **Humanitarian impact:** $ value delivered, partners, delivery success rates, third-party audits. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n# Suggested \u201clines to take\u201d (tight, reusable)\n1) **On principle:** \u201cSingapore supports the UN Charter and international law because small states depend on them\u2014not because we are na\u00efve about power.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n2) **On Israel\u2013Palestine:** \u201cRelease all hostages, protect civilians, respect IHL, and build credible Palestinian governance that rejects terror. We will calibrate recognition/ties to concrete progress on these fronts.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \n3) **On cohesion:** \u201cWe will act against incitement and foreign IOs; disagreement is allowed, intimidation is not.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue201  \n4) **On trade order:** \u201cWe are working to restore binding dispute settlement. Until then, we use the MPIA and regional rule-making to keep commerce predictable.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\nHold fast to **law + capability + cohesion**. That means defending the UN system in concrete ways, insulating our multi-religious society from imported polarisation, keeping economic arteries open under sanctions duress, and offering **practical** pathways (hostages, humanitarian access, governance reform) rather than declaratory politics. It is entirely possible to call out attempts to erode the UN, **and** to keep relationships intact\u2014provided every public stance is coupled to a realistic plan and an open door in private."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":426,"end_idx":445,"safe_urls":["https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Overseas-Mission/Bangkok/About-Singapore/Foreign-Policy?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Home](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Overseas-Mission/Bangkok/About-Singapore/Foreign-Policy?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"singapore's foreign policy","url":"https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Overseas-Mission/Bangkok/About-Singapore/Foreign-Policy?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The fundamental principles of Singapore's foreign policy are as follows: As ...

has mandated five social media platforms, including X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, to block 95 accounts linked to exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui. The accounts published over 120 posts between April 17 and May 10, alleging foreign interference in Singapore\u2019s leadership selection. This follows the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act passed in October 2021, marking its first use to block social media content. Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs cited Guo and his organizations for spreading false narratives against national interests. Guo, a former Chinese real estate developer, fled China in 2014 amid an anti-corruption crackdown and was recently convicted in the U.S. for defrauding followers. Singapore's fourth Prime Minister, Lawrence Wong, was sworn in on May 15. The government believes Guo's network poses a threat to Singapore\u2019s sovereignty and social cohesion through coordinated hostile information campaigns.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Factually"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn3search8\ue201","start_idx":3701,"end_idx":3733,"safe_urls":["https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/amld-amendments---30-june-2025/mas-notice-snr-n01.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2022/03/20220305-sanctions?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Home](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2022/03/20220305-sanctions?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Sanctions and Restrictions Against Russia in Response to ...","url":"https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2022/03/20220305-sanctions?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Mar 5, 2022 \u2014 We will impose export controls on items that can be directly used as weapons to inflict harm on or to subjugate the Ukrainians, as well as items ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Notice SNR-N01 30 June 2025 NOTICE TO FINANCIAL ...","url":"https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/amld-amendments---30-june-2025/mas-notice-snr-n01.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"MAS Notice SNR-N01. 30 June 2025.

So I would say there is a risk of fracture, but the UN is still the only game in town, and it\u2019s our duty to lean in and to help this process of engagement,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nDr Balakrishnan said three big clusters of issues had emerged at the UNGA in 2025: war and peace; economic development and sustainable growth; and the global commons such as climate change, pandemics and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe underscored that Singapore, despite being a small state, has been present and active at the platform.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the work of Ambassador Rena Lee, who presided over negotiations for the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdictions (High Seas) Treaty, which earlier in September crossed the 60-ratification threshold and will enter into force in January 2026; Singapore\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN Burhan Gafoor, who chaired the UN\u2019s cyber-security working group that achieved consensus among major powers; and Mr Daren Tang, director-general of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, who oversaw the conclusion of two new treaties.\r\n\r\n\u201cSmall states like Singapore, or even medium powers, still have agency, still have strategic options, and the need for us to lean in, to support one another, and to keep multilateral processes and that mindset alive and well,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about Singapore\u2019s message at the UNGA, given his past remarks that a rules-based order is an existential necessity for small states, Dr Balakrishnan said the past 80 years after World War II had been a unique and productive phase of history.\r\n\r\nFor countries like Singapore, which achieved national identity, cohesion and good governance, the decades after the war were a time of opportunity, when many small states gained independence, built prosperity and benefited from global supply chains and the spread of technology and ideas.\r\n\r\nBut this old world order is now over, said Dr Balakrishnan, noting that the US, being \u201cthe superpower that underwrote this\u201d, has taken a narrower and more transactional approach, feeling that it was not adequately compensated and that others were free-riding.\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s rise, especially since its reform and opening up in 1978, has also sharpened contestation and reshaped the balance of power.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat sharper superpower contestation does make it more difficult for consensus to be achieved at the UN. It also does make it more difficult for multilateralism to work and to forge collective and effective responses to issues affecting the global commons such as climate change, pandemics and, in the future, artificial intelligence,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nHe added that there is anxiety about the effectiveness of the UN, with the Security Council still reflecting the realities of 1945 even though the distribution of power, technology and influence is now very different.\r\n\r\nEarlier on Sept 28, the minister delivered Singapore\u2019s national statement at the UNGA, where he highlighted the rising use of veto powers at the Security Council, cautioning that such actions risk undermining international security and peace.\r\n\r\nThe Security Council\u2019s five permanent members \u2013 China, France, Russia, Britain and the US \u2013 each have the power to veto, enabling them to block any substantive resolution no matter how much backing it receives from other members.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe increasing, and if I may add, cynical use of vetoes by the P5 must be constrained, and the wider UN membership must reach agreement on how this veto is to be exercised in the future,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nEarlier in September, America exercised this right for the sixth time on a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, with Washington arguing that the text was flawed as it did not condemn Hamas or affirm Israel\u2019s right to self-defence. The measure was, nevertheless, supported by all 14 other council members.\r\n\r\nDr Balakrishnan also emphasised how the world must double down on multilateralism founded on international law.\r\n\r\n\u201cNotwithstanding this prevailing pessimism, Singapore believes that the multilateral system and international law, underpinned by the UN, still remains the best way to uphold global peace and prosperity in a fair and inclusive way,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nDr Balakrishnan stressed in the interview that multilateralism and the rules-based order remain essential, especially for small states, which must \u201cinsist on our own agency and our own autonomy and work together\u201d.\r\n\r\nHe added that a healthy majority of members still believe in multilateralism and that a properly reformed UN can maintain peace, deliver public goods to protect the global commons, and provide hope for economic development.\r\n\r\nOn climate change, Dr Balakrishnan acknowledged scepticism from some quarters, including US President Donald Trump, who has questioned whether man-made activities are causing global warming.\r\n\r\nBut he noted that Mr Trump had also spoken of atmospheric and marine pollution and the transboundary effects of such problems, showing that even America recognises the global commons can come under threat.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a combination of keeping everybody focused on science, reminding everyone that no one country, even no single superpower, can solve all these problems on its own,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nTouching on the conflict in the Middle East in the interview, Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore\u2019s position is rooted in international law, and that it hopes to see an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid for Palestinians.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf one side is going to insist that might is right, and that the outcome must be based on military might in the long run, that is not how you get a solution that everyone will accept,\u201d he said, adding that such an approach would be \u201cinimical to small states in the long run\u201d.\r\n\r\nHe said the meetings at the UN had been a good opportunity for Singapore to explain its stance.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament on Sept 22, Dr Balakrishnan had said that Singapore will recognise the state of Palestine when it has an effective government that accepts Israel\u2019s right to exist and categorically renounces terrorism.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Singapore\u2019s support for a two-state solution means it will oppose any steps by Israel to extinguish or undermine such an outcome.\r\n\r\nHe reiterated this position during his speech at the UN, saying: \u201cIf the situation continues to deteriorate, or if Israel takes further steps to extinguish a two-state solution, we will then have to reconsider our position on when to recognise a Palestinian state.\u201d\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9868b582ece5f88a-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aea0c89c-3548-4134-9a00-f01a9ce83c7d","children":["46eada17-fa7c-45da-81ea-79b9a20450ea"]},"46eada17-fa7c-45da-81ea-79b9a20450ea":{"id":"46eada17-fa7c-45da-81ea-79b9a20450ea","message":{"id":"46eada17-fa7c-45da-81ea-79b9a20450ea","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759119848.0565813,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"9868b582ece5f88a-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"90343af5-804e-42a7-a938-8b9c77aafa57","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"90343af5-804e-42a7-a938-8b9c77aafa57","children":["d90e32f4-45d3-4cb1-afd5-4065f073818a"]},"d90e32f4-45d3-4cb1-afd5-4065f073818a":{"id":"d90e32f4-45d3-4cb1-afd5-4065f073818a","message":{"id":"d90e32f4-45d3-4cb1-afd5-4065f073818a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759119849.271756,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Reviewing key article points","content":"I'll analyze the user's article and connect it with our previous discussion.

The proposed plan reportedly includes a 21-point framework which calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages held by Hamas within 48 hours, and a phased Israeli military withdrawal. Arab officials and Hamas confirmed they have been briefed but await formal proposals.\n\nNetanyahu reiterated his goal to dismantle Hamas, whose 2023 attack ignited the conflict. However, he expressed willingness to allow Hamas operatives to leave Gaza in exchange for an end to hostilities and hostage releases. Meanwhile, the war has taken a devastating toll, with over 66,000 Palestinians reported killed and around 168,000 wounded, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Amid escalating violence, international pressure, including potential EU sanctions and calls for boycott, has intensified against Israel.\n\nThe situation remains critical, with frequent Israeli airstrikes, massive displacement, infrastructure destruction, and famine in Gaza, alongside rising violence in the West Bank.

Balakrishnan emphasized that Singapore's recognition of Palestinian statehood is inevitable, but dependent on conditions like the emergence of a capable Palestinian government that acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to exist and renounces terrorism. Despite close diplomatic and military ties with Israel since 1965, Singapore supported U.N. resolutions in 2024 favoring Palestinian statehood.

The resolution, backed by 14 of the 15 Council members, marks the sixth U.S. veto regarding the nearly two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas. Despite confirmed famine in Gaza and worsening humanitarian conditions due to Israel\u2019s military expansion in Gaza City, the U.S. maintained its diplomatic protection of Israel. The U.S. justified its veto by blaming Hamas for prolonging the war and rejecting ceasefire terms, though it recently supported a council statement condemning strikes on Qatar. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected to meet with President Trump in Washington on September 29, following his UN General Assembly address. The conflict, initiated by a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 64,000 Palestinian and 1,200 Israeli deaths, mostly civilians, according to respective sources.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":17},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue201","start_idx":1593,"end_idx":1625,"safe_urls":["https://press.un.org/en/2024/ga12593.doc.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.justsecurity.org/86140/the-u-n-general-assemblys-veto-initiative-turns-one-is-it-working/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([UN Press](https://press.un.org/en/2024/ga12593.doc.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Veto Must Not End UN Action, Speakers Stress in General ...","url":"https://press.un.org/en/2024/ga12593.doc.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Apr 23, 2024 \u2014 Under this initiative, the General Assembly has a standing mandate to convene within 10 working days of a veto being cast in the Council.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"The U.N.

The resolution, backed by 14 of the 15 Council members, marks the sixth U.S. veto regarding the nearly two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas. Despite confirmed famine in Gaza and worsening humanitarian conditions due to Israel\u2019s military expansion in Gaza City, the U.S. maintained its diplomatic protection of Israel. The U.S. justified its veto by blaming Hamas for prolonging the war and rejecting ceasefire terms, though it recently supported a council statement condemning strikes on Qatar. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected to meet with President Trump in Washington on September 29, following his UN General Assembly address. The conflict, initiated by a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 64,000 Palestinian and 1,200 Israeli deaths, mostly civilians, according to respective sources.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201","start_idx":4987,"end_idx":5006,"safe_urls":["https://www.oceancare.org/en/stories_and_news/high-seas-treaty-ratification-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([oceancare.org](https://www.oceancare.org/en/stories_and_news/high-seas-treaty-ratification-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"High Seas Treaty Ratification in place - OceanCare","url":"https://www.oceancare.org/en/stories_and_news/high-seas-treaty-ratification-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1758312050.0,"snippet":"Sep 19, 2025 \u2014 ... 60 ratifications required for the Agreement to enter into force. ...

In a parliamentary statement, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan criticized Israeli politicians for supporting annexation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza, and condemned ongoing settlement expansion such as the E1 project, asserting that it fragments Palestinian territories and undermines the viability of a two-state solution.\n\nSingapore\u2019s stance aligns with a broader international trend of opposition to Israeli settlements, widely considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Balakrishnan emphasized that Singapore's recognition of Palestinian statehood is inevitable, but dependent on conditions like the emergence of a capable Palestinian government that acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to exist and renounces terrorism. Despite close diplomatic and military ties with Israel since 1965, Singapore supported U.N. resolutions in 2024 favoring Palestinian statehood.
