These range from publicly traded companies **betting their treasury on crypto** to **nation-states** adopting Bitcoin as reserve or legal tender, as well as **billionaire investors and \u201cwhales\u201d** who have held large crypto positions across multiple market cycles. Below we detail these key players, discussing the scale of their investments, their credibility/track records in finance, and whether their approach is grounded or driven by speculative hype.\n\n## Corporate and Institutional Bitcoin Accumulators\n\n\u301045\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Illustration of physical Bitcoin representations; many public companies now hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasury.*\u301042\u2020L209-L217\u3011\u301042\u2020L223-L228\u3011\n\n- **MicroStrategy (USA)** \u2013 *Large corporate holder, visionary yet controversial.* Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, led by CEO Michael Saylor, is the **single largest public corporate owner of Bitcoin**, holding **~597,000 BTC** (over 2.7% of the total supply)\u301040\u2020L1-L4\u3011. By mid-2025 they had **601,550 BTC** at an average cost of ~$66,000 each\u301026\u2020L23-L27\u3011, doubling down even as prices rose. Saylor\u2019s track record is mixed \u2013 he built MicroStrategy into a successful tech company but infamously weathered a dot-com era crash. Since 2020 he\u2019s pursued an aggressive strategy of issuing debt/equity to buy Bitcoin, effectively turning MicroStrategy into a **Bitcoin holding company**\u30102\u2020L83-L91\u3011. *Credibility:* Saylor is respected for his conviction and in-depth rationale (he argues Bitcoin is superior to cash for long-term value storage), but critics note a **zealous, ultra-bullish tone**. He often makes outsize claims (e.g. advocating Bitcoin as \u201cdigital energy\u201d and predicting enormous future values), reflecting a **maximalist, hype-prone** psychology despite grounding his strategy in inflation-hedging theory\u30102\u2020L83-L91\u3011.\n\n- **Tesla (USA)** \u2013 *Mega-cap company with a cautious crypto experiment.* Electric car maker Tesla made headlines in early 2021 with a $1.5B Bitcoin buy. As of 2025, Tesla still holds **11,509 BTC** on its balance sheet\u301041\u2020L1-L4\u3011 (after selling a portion in 2022). Financially, Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin stake is **modest relative to its size** (\u2248$0.3B, tiny in a $800B+ company). *Credibility:* Tesla is a highly successful innovator, lending Bitcoin **mainstream legitimacy** when it invested. However, CEO Elon Musk\u2019s behavior introduces volatility \u2013 he has a **track record of whimsical and hype-driven actions in crypto**. For example, Musk touted Dogecoin on social media and made abrupt policy reversals (suspending Bitcoin payments over environmental concerns). His **psychological profile is unpredictable**: technically astute yet prone to meme-driven enthusiasm. Overall Tesla\u2019s approach to Bitcoin is more **grounded** (treating it as a treasury asset and test of liquidity\u301018\u2020L15-L23\u3011) compared to Musk\u2019s personal crypto antics.\n\n- **Other Public Companies:** Several other publicly traded firms also hold significant crypto:\n  - **Block, Inc. (USA)** \u2013 Jack Dorsey\u2019s fintech (formerly Square) holds **8,000\u20139,000 BTC**\u301042\u2020L173-L178\u3011. Dorsey is a credible tech founder with a **staunch Bitcoin advocacy** (seeing it as the future internet currency). He\u2019s factual and focused on utility (funding Bitcoin development), not known for wild price predictions.\n  - **Marathon Digital (USA)** \u2013 A Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company owning **40,435 BTC**\u301042\u2020L171-L174\u3011. Marathon\u2019s credibility lies in its core business (securing the network). Its communications are fairly factual (mining updates, treasury strategy), with little hype beyond bullish outlooks for mining.\n  - **Hut 8 Mining (Canada)** \u2013 Another mining firm, in top-10 public BTC holders (\u22489,000 BTC)\u301042\u2020L173-L178\u3011. Like Marathon, it\u2019s *invested by necessity* (retaining mined coins), and management is generally grounded, though the business itself is speculative on Bitcoin\u2019s future price.\n  - **Robinhood Markets (USA)** \u2013 The popular trading app **custodies ~136,000 BTC**\u301042\u2020L168-L176\u3011 (worth ~$4\u20135B) on behalf of users, making it an inadvertent large holder. While not Robinhood\u2019s own investment, this indicates substantial *retail* accumulation via the platform. Robinhood as a company is credible (despite past controversies) and tends toward factual reporting (e.g. quarterly crypto assets), not hype.\n  - **MassMutual (USA)** \u2013 In a notable conservative stamp of approval, 169-year-old insurance giant MassMutual bought **$100M of Bitcoin** for its general investment fund\u301032\u2020L25-L31\u3011 in late 2020. This represented a tiny slice of its ~$235B portfolio\u301032\u2020L25-L31\u3011, but it was groundbreaking. MassMutual\u2019s impeccable credibility (as a cautious insurer) and **long-term investment horizon** made this move significant. The company framed it in factual terms \u2013 as a **diversification and yield opportunity**, without any promotional hype.\n  - **Other Traditional Funds:** Legendary hedge fund managers have also allocated to Bitcoin. *Paul Tudor Jones*, for instance, revealed a few percent of his fund in BTC as an inflation hedge, famously calling it the \u201c**fastest horse**\u201d to outrun monetary inflation\u301034\u2020L13-L21\u3011. *Stanley Druckenmiller* similarly \u201cwarmed up\u201d to Bitcoin as a store of value in 2020, noting its potential as an asset class\u301036\u2020L13-L21\u3011. These investors carry top-tier credibility (decades of market success) and approach crypto with **analytical caution**. Their public statements are generally measured \u2013 Jones likened Bitcoin to gold in the 1970s\u301034\u2020L9-L17\u3011, while Druckenmiller said he owns some BTC but warned of volatility. *Bill Miller* (another famed investor) went even further, at one point putting **50% of his personal portfolio in Bitcoin**, citing confidence in its long-term upside. Miller, Jones, and Druckenmiller exemplify **grounded optimism**: they frame Bitcoin within macroeconomic and portfolio theory contexts, steering clear of the bombastic claims common among crypto evangelists.\n\n- **Private Companies and Institutional Holdings:** A few privately held firms and institutional vehicles have amassed notable Bitcoin stakes:\n  - **Block.one (China)** \u2013 The company behind EOS ICO, which reportedly holds **164,000 BTC** (0.7% of supply)\u301042\u2020L183-L191\u3011. This came from profits raised during its 2017\u201318 token sale. Block.one\u2019s founders (e.g. Brendan Blumer) are wealthy from crypto; they largely operate behind the scenes. *Credibility:* Medium \u2013 they delivered a controversial blockchain (EOS) but proved adept at treasury management by stockpiling Bitcoin. Their stance is more opportunistic than evangelical (little public hype; in fact, EOS drew criticism for under-delivering despite big claims).\n  - **Stone Ridge Holdings (USA)** \u2013 A finance firm whose subsidiary NYDIG offers Bitcoin services, holds ~**10,889 BTC**\u301042\u2020L187-L193\u3011. CEO\u00a0Ross Stevens has explicitly endorsed Bitcoin as a core long-term reserve. Stone Ridge is a credible Wall Street player blending into crypto; communications are **sober and institutional** (talk of risk management and \u201cstore-of-value\u201d rationale).\n  - **Tether, Ltd. (International)** \u2013 The issuer of the USDT stablecoin has begun **investing some reserve assets in Bitcoin**, holding **~82,454 BTC** (valued ~$8B)\u301042\u2020L189-L193\u3011. This is significant given Tether\u2019s global role. *Credibility:* Tether has been controversial regarding transparency, but it\u2019s delivered a liquid stablecoin for years. Its Bitcoin buys are framed as using excess profits to strengthen reserves \u2013 a pragmatic if debatable choice. The tone from Tether\u2019s team is typically **fact-of-business** (they report holdings in quarterly attestations) rather than promotional, though skeptics worry this *could* be risky hype if reserves fluctuate with BTC\u2019s price.\n  - **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Trusts:** Indirectly, **investment funds hold ~1.25 million BTC** on behalf of clients (\u22485.9% of supply)\u301042\u2020L209-L217\u3011. Notably, BlackRock\u2019s **iShares Bitcoin Trust** (a proposed spot Bitcoin ETF) would hold **~530,000 BTC**\u301042\u2020L207-L214\u3011 if approved \u2013 a signal of major institutional demand. BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and others filing for Bitcoin ETFs are **blue-chip asset managers** with stellar track records. Their interest in Bitcoin is driven by client demand and the view of Bitcoin as an *emerging asset class*. These firms approach crypto very **pragmatically and cautiously** \u2013 e.g. BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink (once a skeptic) now calls Bitcoin \u201cdigitally gold\u201d and an international asset, but couches this in careful terms, avoiding any wild price forecasts. The **credibility** they bring is immense (they manage trillions in traditional assets), and their psychological profile is highly **fact-based** and risk-aware (e.g. insisting on regulatory clarity, custodial security, etc., rather than promoting any get-rich-quick narrative).\n\n## Institutions Investing in Ethereum and Major Cryptos\n\nWhile Bitcoin is the principal reserve asset, **Ethereum (ETH)** and other major cryptos have also attracted institutional investors \u2013 especially as Ethereum\u2019s network has matured post-\u201cMerge\u201d (proof-of-stake). In 2024\u20132025 a mini-wave of **Ethereum treasury accumulation** emerged, echoing the Bitcoin strategy:\n\n- **SharpLink Gaming (USA)** \u2013 *Public company pivoting to ETH treasury.* In July 2025, SharpLink (Nasdaq: SBET) announced it had become the **largest corporate holder of Ether**, accumulating **280,706 ETH** (~$840M worth)\u301012\u2020L178-L187\u3011\u301012\u2020L180-L188\u3011. This small tech firm raised $413M via share issuance and bought ETH aggressively (74,656 ETH in one week at ~$2,852 each)\u301012\u2020L188-L196\u3011. It even overtook the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s holdings, after purchasing 10,000 ETH directly from the Foundation OTC\u301012\u2020L214-L222\u3011. Notably, **Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin joined SharpLink as Chairman**\u301012\u2020L221-L228\u3011, lending significant credibility. SharpLink\u2019s strategy mirrors Saylor\u2019s Bitcoin playbook: raise capital to buy crypto, then **stake the ETH for yield** (they run validators and earned 415 ETH in rewards so far)\u301012\u2020L223-L231\u3011. *Credibility:* The involvement of Lubin (a highly respected figure in Ethereum\u2019s history) boosts trust, but the company itself is new to this space. Its stock price surged after the ETH pivot\u301012\u2020L209-L217\u3011, suggesting market buy-in. Psychologically, SharpLink\u2019s management appears **bold and speculative** \u2013 embracing high risk for high reward \u2013 yet also **grounded in Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals** (they emphasize staking income and long-term network growth, not just price). This blend of vision and risk means they **teeter between factual planning and speculative bet**; however, public communications (SEC filings, press releases) remain factual about amounts raised and acquired, avoiding flamboyant promises.\n\n- **Other Institutional ETH Buyers:** SharpLink is part of a broader trend in 2024\u201325 of institutions looking \u201cbeyond Bitcoin\u201d:\n  - **Bitmine Immersion and Bit Digital (USA)** \u2013 Crypto mining/tech firms that shifted treasury focus to Ethereum, each announcing hundreds of millions in ETH buys\u301012\u2020L229-L236\u3011. These are smaller cap companies following SharpLink\u2019s lead. Their credibility is evolving \u2013 they are *leveraging crypto expertise (mining)* to justify holding ETH. They present the move as a **strategic diversification** and attempt to capture staking yield, not mere speculation.\n  - **Tesla and Others:** Though most corporate crypto treasuries are Bitcoin-only, a few hold Ethereum. Tesla reportedly accumulated **about 29,000 ETH** in 2021 for its reserves (alongside Bitcoin)\u301011\u2020L15-L23\u3011. Tesla never hyped this quietly-held ETH, and it did not feature in their public statements in the way Bitcoin did (e.g. no announcement akin to the BTC buy). This suggests any ETH exposure by Tesla was **small-scale and experimental**, fitting the company\u2019s cautious stance after the initial crypto foray.\n  - **Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE):** An investment trust for ETH (much like GBTC for Bitcoin) holds roughly **1.2 million ETH** for investors\u301015\u2020L125-L133\u3011\u301015\u2020L147-L155\u3011. While not a single \u201cinvestor,\u201d this large holding reflects institutional demand via traditional vehicles. The trust is managed by Grayscale (owned by Digital Currency Group, led by Barry Silbert). Grayscale/DCG have a strong track record in crypto asset management. Silbert himself is an early crypto investor with a credible history (though DCG faced challenges in 2022, they remain influential). Grayscale\u2019s communications are formal and regulatory-focused, not promotional \u2013 e.g. lobbying the SEC to allow ETF conversion, citing market data, rather than hyping ETH\u2019s future price.\n  - **Traditional Finance Entrants:** 2024 saw **U.S. futures-based Ethereum ETFs** launch and filings for spot ETH ETFs, indicating that major players like **BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco** intend to offer ETH exposure. This **validates Ethereum\u2019s credibility** as an investable asset. These firms are highly **fact-driven**; their interest is pitched in terms of **client demand for diversification and ETH\u2019s evolving use-cases** (not because they themselves are \u201cbelievers\u201d). For example, Fidelity Digital Assets has been quietly mining Ethereum and offering custody for years \u2013 an approach rooted in **technical understanding and due diligence** rather than public fanfare.\n\n- **Why Institutions Value Ethereum:** Unlike Bitcoin (often treated purely as \u201cdigital gold\u201d), Ethereum is seen as a **productive asset**. With the shift to proof-of-stake, institutions note that **ETH can generate yield through staking** \u2013 making it akin to a **bond or interest-bearing investment**\u301038\u2020L258-L266\u3011\u301038\u2020L261-L268\u3011. Companies holding ETH can earn ~5% annual rewards, so the asset **\u201cworks\u201d for them while on the balance sheet**. Moreover, Ethereum underpins *Web3 and DeFi ecosystems*; forward-looking investors view owning ETH as a stake in the future of decentralized finance, NFT platforms, and tokenized real-world assets. This rationale is **grounded in technology adoption trends** rather than short-term hype. For instance, the **tokenization of real-world assets (RWA)** on Ethereum and its Layer-2s is accelerating in 2025\u301038\u2020L261-L270\u3011. Banks and even governments are issuing bonds and currencies on Ethereum, lending it gravitas. By holding ETH, institutions gain exposure to this innovation wave. Generally, corporate buyers of ETH present a **measured, strategic justification** (yield, tech integration, network growth) and have **track records of patience**. That said, pockets of hype exist \u2013 e.g. during the 2025 rally, some Ethereum advocates (even a new \u201cCommunity Foundation\u201d) openly targeted a \u201c$10,000 ETH\u201d price\u301038\u2020L273-L279\u3011. Those claims echo typical crypto exuberance, but they come *after* real institutional steps were taken. In summary, Ethereum is attracting institutions who **blend factual optimism with some speculation** on its continued success as the dominant smart contract platform.\n\n## Governments and Central Banks in Crypto\n\nSeveral national governments and even central banks are now directly or indirectly involved in crypto accumulation. Their financial heft ranges from **small-country treasuries to superpower seizures**, and their credibility spans from experimental to highly conservative institutions:\n\n\u301048\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Aerial view of Thimphu, Bhutan\u2019s capital. Bhutan\u2019s sovereign fund mines Bitcoin with hydropower, illustrating a small nation\u2019s strategic crypto investment\u301031\u2020L169-L177\u3011\u301031\u2020L181-L189\u3011.*\n\n- **El Salvador (Government)** \u2013 *The first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.* El Salvador\u2019s government, led by President Nayib Bukele, has been **actively buying Bitcoin for its treasury** since 2021. It holds **5,963 BTC** to date\u301042\u2020L223-L228\u3011. Financially this is a **small investment (~$180M)**, but significant relative to El Salvador\u2019s economy. *Credibility:* Bukele\u2019s administration is a mix of populist politics and bold experiments \u2013 he has a strong domestic approval but is viewed warily by international financial institutions. Making Bitcoin legal tender (in Sept 2021) was unprecedented. The government\u2019s track record on this investment is still unfolding: they bought many coins at high prices, weathered a deep bear market in 2022, but continue to hold and even **\u201cbuy the dip\u201d** (at one point Bukele announced purchasing 1 BTC per day). **Psychologically**, Bukele leans into **hype and optimism** \u2013 branding El Salvador as \u201cBitcoin Land\u201d, proposing a \u201cBitcoin City\u201d and volcano-powered mining. His tweets often cheerlead Bitcoin\u2019s future. Yet, aspects of the approach are grounded: the country has used Bitcoin to attract tourism and tech talent, and issued a Bitcoin-backed bond. Overall, El Salvador is *a small but symbolically important player*, with a **high-risk, high-reward bet** and a promotional style tempered by the realities of governance (they still rely on the USD and IMF for stability).\n\n- **Kingdom of Bhutan (Sovereign Wealth Fund)** \u2013 *Stealth accumulation via green mining.* The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan quietly built a sizeable crypto position as part of its sovereign investments. The state-owned fund (Druk Holding & Investments) **mines Bitcoin using hydropower** and began adding crypto to its portfolio in 2019\u301031\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301031\u2020L181-L189\u3011. Bhutan\u2019s holdings are reportedly **12,578 BTC**\u301042\u2020L223-L228\u3011 (worth ~$380M), which astonishingly equals ~15% of its GDP\u301029\u2020L1-L9\u3011. They also held other coins and engaged with crypto firms (it came to light in 2023 that Bhutan had loans with BlockFi and Celsius). *Credibility:* Bhutan\u2019s government has a reputation for prudent, long-term planning (famous for its \u201cGross National Happiness\u201d development philosophy). The revelation that it was betting on cryptocurrency was surprising but showed **strategic foresight**: officials say **Bitcoin mining revenues paid for two years of public services**\u301031\u2020L169-L177\u3011. They pitch their crypto as **\u201cgreen\u201d coins (100% hydro-powered)** and explore selling green mining credits to corporations\u301031\u2020L171-L179\u3011\u301031\u2020L199-L207\u3011. Bhutan\u2019s tone is measured and pragmatic. The fund\u2019s CEO described Bitcoin as a *\u201cgamechanger\u201d for a small economy*, providing liquidity and value to excess hydroelectric capacity\u301031\u2020L201-L209\u3011. There is little hype in Bhutan\u2019s approach \u2013 much was done quietly until media uncovered it. The psychological profile is **fact-based and opportunistic**: they saw an edge (cheap renewable energy) and capitalized on it without making grandiose claims to the public. Bhutan is now openly expanding these efforts as a pillar of its economic strategy, indicating confidence backed by results so far.\n\n- **United States (Government and Seized Assets)** \u2013 *Largest holder via forfeiture, now formalizing reserves.* Uniquely, the U.S. federal government has amassed a large trove of Bitcoin not by intentional investment, but through **law enforcement seizures** (from darknet markets, fraud busts, etc.). As of early 2025, the U.S. is estimated to hold **around 200,000 BTC**\u301028\u2020L147-L155\u3011 \u2013 the **largest state holder globally** \u2013 mainly in custody from cases like Silk Road, PlusToken, and hacker seizures. Historically, the U.S. auctioned off seized Bitcoin (famously, Tim\u00a0Draper bought ~30,000 BTC from a 2014 Marshals auction\u30102\u2020L101-L109\u3011). However, the political tide may be turning: in 2025, President Donald Trump (newly re-elected) signed an Executive Order to establish a **\u201cStrategic Bitcoin Reserve\u201d** using these forfeited bitcoins\u301028\u2020L139-L147\u3011\u301028\u2020L147-L155\u3011. The plan aims to **treat Bitcoin as a national reserve asset** alongside gold. If implemented, this would shift the U.S. from an inadvertent holder to an *active strategic investor* in crypto. *Credibility:* The idea of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve is controversial. Proponents argue it\u2019s forward-thinking financially; critics say it\u2019s risky and politically motivated. The U.S. government\u2019s general track record with crypto has been cautious or even hostile (regulators like the SEC often crack down on the industry). Trump himself was once a crypto skeptic, but by 2024 he claimed a personal **Ethereum holding ($1\u20135 million)**\u301028\u2020L173-L181\u3011 and positioned himself as pro-crypto. The **psychology here is partly political theater** \u2013 branding the U.S. as \u201ccrypto capital of the world\u201d\u301028\u2020L199-L207\u3011 \u2013 and partly a genuine hedge strategy. Some officials like Senator Cynthia Lummis (an avid Bitcoiner) lend grounded credibility, pushing for sound policy. Others may be riding hype, given Trump\u2019s flair for bold, crowd-pleasing moves. Overall, if the U.S. follows through, it adds immense legitimacy to Bitcoin, though the **messaging oscillates** between *factual* (e.g. reports to Congress on crypto\u2019s role in reserves) and *speculative nationalist boosterism*. \n\n  - *Note:* The **Federal Reserve and major central banks** (ECB, BoJ, etc.) currently do **not hold crypto on their balance sheets**, citing risk and lack of regulatory framework\u30106\u2020L225-L233\u3011. In fact, top central bankers often deride crypto (e.g. calling it \u201ctulip mania\u201d\u30106\u2020L225-L233\u3011). The U.S. case is unique because the holdings come from seizures and a political directive, not from the central bank\u2019s initiative. Some smaller central banks are exploring it: e.g. the **Czech National Bank\u2019s governor** publicly said they\u2019ll consider putting **up to 5% of reserves into Bitcoin** (billions of dollars worth)\u30106\u2020L183-L191\u3011\u30106\u2020L185-L192\u3011, although no decision has been made and caution was emphasized (\u201cno decision is imminent\u2026 Bitcoin\u2019s volatility makes it challenging\u201d\u30106\u2020L189-L197\u3011). This indicates a **tentative openness** in at least one Western central bank. Likewise, Swiss crypto advocates tried (unsuccessfully so far) to push the **Swiss National Bank** to hold Bitcoin\u301045\u2020L221-L228\u3011. These developments show that while **most central banks remain skeptical and conservative**, the idea of crypto as a reserve asset is gaining a foothold in mainstream policy discussions \u2013 a remarkable shift from just a few years ago.\n\n- **Other Countries:** \n  - **Central African Republic (CAR)** \u2013 This small African nation followed El Salvador in 2022 to declare Bitcoin legal tender. However, CAR\u2019s foray was mired in controversy and logistical issues. It launched a crypto token project (Sango Coin) that faltered. CAR\u2019s government, with limited financial clout and ongoing instability, is not a major accumulator of Bitcoin (no significant reserves reported). Their credibility in this move was low \u2013 many saw it as a publicity stunt or influenced by outside crypto entrepreneurs. Indeed, the **psychology was hype-driven**, with talk of attracting investment via crypto, but little on-ground adoption has occurred.\n  - **Ukraine** \u2013 While not \u201cinvesting\u201d in crypto per se, Ukraine\u2019s government in 2022\u20132023 **embraced crypto donations** during the war effort. They received tens of millions in Bitcoin, Ether, and other coins from supporters worldwide and quickly learned to custody and convert crypto to support defense and humanitarian needs. Ukraine\u2019s use of crypto showed **pragmatism and innovation** under duress, earning credibility for effectively integrating crypto into national fundraising. Though they likely liquidated much of it for immediate needs, some officials there have been vocal about holding crypto and pushing pro-crypto legislation. The *psychological stance* from Ukraine was very factual/utilitarian: crypto was a neutral tool to achieve funding, with zero hype \u2013 a stark contrast to others touting crypto as a cure-all.\n  - **China (government)** \u2013 Officially, China\u2019s central government has banned crypto trading and mining, but ironically, it ended up with a sizeable Bitcoin cache from cracking down on scams. **Chinese authorities seized** a reported **194,000 BTC (plus other coins)** from the 2019 PlusToken Ponzi bust\u301042\u2020L223-L228\u3011 \u2013 though Chinese media suggest only **15,000 BTC** were retained by the government after proceedings\u301042\u2020L223-L228\u3011. It\u2019s unclear if China still holds those or quietly sold them. Given China\u2019s antipathy to crypto, it\u2019s likely not actively investing more; any current holding is a byproduct of law enforcement. *Credibility:* China\u2019s government is financially powerful, but in crypto its stance is **hostile** (promoting its own CBDC instead). The presence of Bitcoin in its coffers is thus an anomaly, and Beijing\u2019s psychological profile here is purely **pragmatic** \u2013 any coins held would be viewed as seized assets, not strategic reserves. There is **no promotion or narrative** from China of Bitcoin\u2019s value; if anything, they downplay or hide it.\n\nIn summary, **governments\u2019 involvement in crypto ranges widely**. Small nations like El Salvador and Bhutan have **credible if experimental strategies**, blending idealism (or hype) with real investment and innovative use-cases (legal tender, green mining). Large economies are mostly **cautious**, but the U.S. may legitimize Bitcoin by officially stockpiling seized coins. Central bankers mostly remain skeptics publicly, though a few are analyzing the idea. On the whole, when governments invest in or hold crypto, there is a tendency either toward **pragmatic silence** (Bhutan, China\u2019s seizures) or **political grandstanding** (El Salvador\u2019s president tweeting \u201cwe just bought the dip\u201d). Each reflects the unique incentives of public sector actors in this arena.\n\n## Prominent Individual Investors and Long-Term \u201cWhales\u201d\n\nFrom early \u201ccrypto whales\u201d to famous billionaires, many individuals with high net worth have accumulated Bitcoin or Ethereum \u2013 some as **long-term believers** since early cycles, others as **new converts** during recent booms. Here we profile notable figures, their investment size, credibility, and whether they\u2019re grounded or promotional in mindset:\n\n- **The Winklevoss Twins (USA)** \u2013 *Early adopters turned exchange founders.* Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss famously invested in Bitcoin after settling with Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg in 2008. By 2013, they disclosed having **~$11 million in BTC at ~$120 per coin**, and today they\u2019re estimated to own **~70,000 BTC**\u301043\u2020L5-L10\u3011\u301043\u2020L7-L10\u3011 (over $2 billion). Financially, this makes them large holders (\u201cBitcoin billionaires\u201d). They\u2019ve since built the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, aiming to bring regulatory compliance to crypto. *Credibility:* The twins have a decent track record \u2013 they were prescient on Bitcoin and have run Gemini responsibly (though it faced setbacks like a recent lending program failure). They generally maintain a **measured, principled tone**: they advocate Bitcoin as \u201cgold 2.0\u201d and have made bullish long-term price targets (e.g. $500K/BTC someday), but in a reasoned framework (comparing market caps of gold and Bitcoin). Their psychological profile is **optimistic but relatively sober** \u2013 far from ranting maximalists, they often speak about fostering trust and integration with traditional finance. They continue to **hold their BTC through cycles** (no indication of major selling), signaling genuine long-term conviction rather than short-term hype.\n\n- **Tim Draper (USA)** \u2013 *Venture capitalist with bold predictions.* Tim Draper is a well-known tech investor (early in Skype, Tesla, etc.) who ventured into Bitcoin very early. He first bought **40,000 BTC** on Mt. Gox, which unfortunately he lost when that exchange collapsed\u30102\u2020L101-L107\u3011. Undeterred, he famously purchased **29,656 BTC** for $18.7M in a 2014 U.S. Marshals auction (cost basis ~$632/BTC)\u30102\u2020L103-L107\u3011. Those coins alone are worth ~$900M today, and Draper likely added more later, making him a significant whale. *Credibility:* Draper has an excellent track record in venture investing. In crypto, he\u2019s a true believer who put money in when few would. However, he\u2019s also **prone to outlandish predictions** \u2013 for example, he repeatedly forecasted Bitcoin reaching $250,000 by 2022 or 2023, which did not materialize (he has since extended the timeline, still confident it will happen). Draper\u2019s style is **energetic and promotional**; he wears a Bitcoin tie, sings Bitcoin songs in public, and encourages governments to adopt crypto. While his enthusiasm is genuine, it often crosses into **hype territory**. That said, he remains **fully invested and hasn\u2019t capitulated**. His credibility as an investor lends some weight to his claims (people recall he was right to buy at $600), but the hyperbole means his comments are taken with a grain of salt by the wider financial community.\n\n- **Michael Saylor (USA)** \u2013 *Personal holdings and evangelism.* Apart from MicroStrategy\u2019s corporate stash, Saylor himself revealed he personally owned **17,732 BTC** as of October 2020\u30102\u2020L109-L115\u3011 (then worth ~$240M). He\u2019s likely added more since, though he hasn\u2019t disclosed updates. Saylor is thus a whale individually, not just via his company. His credibility and psychology mirror MicroStrategy\u2019s discussion above: he\u2019s an articulate advocate with almost messianic zeal for Bitcoin. He tends to speak in **grand philosophical terms** (\u201cBitcoin is a Thermodynamic Miracle\u201d type of language) and has made very aggressive statements (implying holding Bitcoin is a moral or fiduciary imperative). While he cites data and history (e.g. inflation of fiat) \u2013 giving a *veneer of factual reasoning* \u2013 the fervor of his beliefs is undeniable. In sum, Saylor-the-individual is *highly credible in technology and business*, yet in crypto he\u2019s seen as a **maximalist evangelist**, praised by some and considered overly fanatical by others. \n\n- **\u201cCrypto OG\u201d Whales:** Beyond those public figures, a substantial portion of Bitcoin\u2019s supply is held by anonymous early adopters and crypto industry pioneers:\n  - **Satoshi Nakamoto** \u2013 The creator of Bitcoin holds the biggest fortune of all: roughly **968,000 BTC** mined in 2009\u20132010\u30102\u2020L61-L69\u3011 (worth >$29B today). These coins remain completely untouched. While Satoshi\u2019s identity is unknown, this stash represents the ultimate \u201clong-term hold\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s never been sold in any cycle, effectively removed from circulation. Satoshi\u2019s psychological profile can only be inferred from writings: *ideologically driven, not profit-motivated*, given the coins haven\u2019t moved. This giant dormant holding contributes to the heavy long-term holder statistics (and effectively boosts everyone else\u2019s relative share due to its inactivity).\n  - **Other Early Whales:** Many individuals who mined or invested in Bitcoin from 2010\u20132013 have held large amounts through multiple booms and busts. Blockchain data shows **four addresses hold between 100k and 1M BTC each** (likely exchanges or early whales), and the next ~90 largest addresses (10k\u2013100k BTC each) collectively hold over 2.28 million BTC\u30102\u2020L127-L135\u3011. Importantly, **long-term holders now control roughly 69%\u201374% of all Bitcoin supply**, a record high in 15 years\u30109\u2020L26-L33\u3011\u301010\u2020L924-L932\u3011. This means that coins are increasingly in the hands of those who have held for many months or years, rather than recent speculators. Such data implies **many early-cycle investors are *still in***, not \u201cout of the market.\u201d In previous bull runs (2017, 2021) long-term holders did sell some at peaks, but each trough sees them accumulating back\u30109\u2020L35-L43\u3011. Notably, during the latest rally (2024\u20132025), long-term holders as a group did *not* massively reduce positions as they had in past manias\u30109\u2020L43-L49\u3011 \u2013 a sign of **strengthened conviction**. Some famous names in this category:\n    - *Roger Ver:* Nicknamed \u201cBitcoin Jesus,\u201d he was an early investor who amassed tens of thousands of BTC. Ver later advocated Bitcoin Cash (selling some BTC for it), denting his credibility among Bitcoin purists. He remains a crypto whale, but his public persona shifted to altcoins. His communications became somewhat promotional for BCH, and a recent dispute over debts tarnished his reputation. He exemplifies an early whale who **partly cashed out or pivoted**, arguably *diminishing* his long-term influence in Bitcoin.\n    - *Barry Silbert:* Founder of Digital Currency Group (parent of Grayscale and other ventures), he was an early Bitcoin investor and has likely held a significant personal stake (though exact numbers are private). Silbert successfully built a crypto empire, suggesting he maintained belief. However, DCG faced financial troubles in 2022 (after a subsidiary\u2019s bankruptcy), which led to some unwinding. Silbert\u2019s style is fairly **professional/low-key**; he doesn\u2019t make outrageous public claims. He\u2019s more of a builder than a vocal evangelist these days.\n    - *Chamath Palihapitiya:* A Silicon Valley venture capitalist who in the early 2010s said he owned a large Bitcoin stash (he once said **\u201cBitcoin has effectively replaced gold\u201d** in his portfolio). Chamath rode the 2020\u20132021 boom, but by April 2023 he declared **\u201cCrypto is dead in America\u201d**\u301033\u2020L0-L8\u3011 due to regulatory crackdowns. He indicated he had dramatically scaled back exposure. This marks a case of a high-profile early bull *exiting* (or at least stepping away) in later cycles. Chamath\u2019s initial stance was rational (he saw Bitcoin as insurance against money printing), but his later commentary turned pessimistic and critical of the industry\u2019s hype. It illustrates that **not all previous cycle holders remain \u2013 some have cashed out or lost faith**, especially amid legal/regulatory setbacks.\n    - *\u201cHODL\u201d Mentality:* Many anonymous long-term holders simply hold without fanfare. For instance, addresses associated with early mining or dormant for 10+ years occasionally surface moving a small portion (which grabs news headlines, e.g. a whale from 2011 moving coins in 2023 after a decade of inactivity). These moves are rare. By and large, **the majority of early bitcoins appear to be in very strong hands or lost**, contributing to the statistic that ~**14.5 million BTC (about 69% of supply) are held long-term**\u30109\u2020L26-L33\u3011. Their psychological profile is literally \u201cHODL\u201d \u2013 extreme patience, apparently *unmoved by short-term price swings*. This patient cohort often acts as a stabilizing force, whereas newer entrants trade in and out.\n\n- **Crypto Industry Leaders:** Figures like *Brian Armstrong* (CEO of Coinbase) and *Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao* (CEO of Binance) likely personally hold significant crypto (both Bitcoin and others). They rarely disclose their portfolios in detail, but CZ has said he holds almost 100% of his net worth in crypto, mostly in his exchange\u2019s coin and some BTC \u2013 a **remarkably high-risk stance** that shows strong personal conviction (or overconfidence, depending on view). CZ\u2019s track record is building the largest exchange, but he\u2019s faced regulatory crackdowns; he tweets actively, sometimes in a promotional vein (\u201cFunds are SAFU\u201d memes, etc.). Armstrong is more understated \u2013 Coinbase as a company holds ~**~5,000 BTC and ~17,000 ETH** on its balance sheet (as of 2023) as a liquidity and investment reserve\u301015\u2020L125-L133\u3011\u301015\u2020L139-L147\u3011, and Armstrong himself likely holds plenty, given he\u2019s an early adopter. *Credibility:* Both are respected as entrepreneurs, though their **public communications differ** \u2013 Armstrong is policy-focused and factual, whereas CZ often engages in industry boosterism on social media. Nonetheless, each in their way has *talked up* crypto adoption globally. They represent the class of insiders who **got wealthy from crypto businesses and continue to hold large stakes** as a sign of faith in the ecosystem\u2019s growth.\n\n- **Traditional Billionaires Joining In:** In recent years, more well-known investors and even celebrities dipped into crypto:\n  - *Mark Cuban* (entrepreneur and NBA team owner) shifted from skeptic to enthusiast, stating he holds more ETH than BTC. He got involved in DeFi and NFTs on Ethereum. Cuban has a credible business background but has been candid about learning through small failures (he lost money on some DeFi rug-pulls). He does promote crypto use-cases (blockchain for ticketing, etc.) and sometimes hypes meme coins (he once boosted Dogecoin\u2019s merits for payments). So his approach mixes **pragmatic exploration with a bit of fad-chasing**. He remains invested but also *critical of over-speculation* after experiencing the volatility.\n  - *Kevin O\u2019Leary* (Canadian investor from Shark Tank) went from calling Bitcoin \u201cgarbage\u201d to allocating ~5% of his portfolio to crypto by 2021. He became an outspoken advocate for regulation in crypto. However, his credibility took a hit with the FTX scandal (he was a paid spokesperson and initially defended the failed exchange). O\u2019Leary\u2019s stance is mostly **pragmatic** (he emphasizes compliance and stablecoins), but the flip-flop and involvement with a hype-driven exchange showed the **perils of chasing trends**. He claims to still hold Bitcoin/ETH, but with more caution.\n  - *Howard Lutnick* (CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald) isn\u2019t a household crypto name, but notably he was tapped for a U.S. government role and it came out he owns \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in Bitcoin\u301028\u2020L175-L183\u3011. Lutnick is a veteran of traditional finance \u2013 that he accumulated such a stake is a strong vote of confidence. He\u2019s not publicly hyping Bitcoin; this seems a **personal reserve strategy**, indicating some *quiet belief* among Wall Street elites.\n  - *Celebrities*: A few entertainment or sports figures invested in Bitcoin (e.g. rapper Jay-Z, NFL player Tom Brady with some crypto deals, etc.), but these are generally small relative to their net worth and often tied to endorsements. Their credibility as investors is usually low (some promotions ended in lawsuits), so while they add to crypto\u2019s cultural buzz, they aren\u2019t major \u201caccumulators\u201d shaping the market.\n\n**Long-Term Holders \u2013 In or Out?** By and large, evidence suggests *many of the long-term players remain in*. The record high share of Bitcoin in long-term holder wallets (roughly **74% held >155 days** as of mid-2025\u301010\u2020L924-L932\u3011) implies that earlier cycle investors did not all cash out \u2013 instead, many **increased their holdings over time**\u30109\u2020L37-L45\u3011. Those who believed in Bitcoin/crypto as a paradigm shift (Winklevoss, Saylor, Draper, etc.) have mostly held or added through each bear market, showing steadfast (if at times stubborn) conviction. Some have **partially exited or reduced exposure** (Chamath P., or some anonymous whales selling a portion after 10+ years\u30107\u2020L3-L8\u3011), but a wholesale exodus of early believers is not apparent. In fact, *on-chain data indicates* that during recent price surges, fewer old coins were spent than in past peaks\u30109\u2020L43-L49\u3011 \u2013 suggesting a maturation where longtime investors aren\u2019t eager to trade away their crypto for short-term profit, possibly due to strengthened confidence in its future value.\n\nHowever, the **psychological evolution** is noteworthy: early on, enthusiasm often led to unrealistic promises (every cycle saw figures claiming Bitcoin or Ether would \u201ctake over the world\u201d imminently). Over time, many veteran investors have become **more level-headed**. They still promote crypto\u2019s potential, but often with caveats about volatility, regulation, and proper risk management. Even maximalists have refined their arguments beyond memes to institutional-grade theses (e.g. addressing pension funds about portfolio allocation benefits). On the other side, those drawn in purely by hype (without understanding) often fell out when bubbles burst \u2013 leaving a core of more **resilient, knowledgeable long-term holders** in each cycle\u2019s aftermath.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** *The landscape of crypto accumulation today is diverse.* We have **public companies like MicroStrategy and SharpLink** making unprecedented large bets, **institutional giants** dipping in via funds and ETFs, **governments** from the U.S. to Bhutan holding coins for reasons ranging from strategic reserves to crime seizures, and **high-profile individuals** who range from evangelists to pragmatists. Financial positions vary widely \u2013 from trillion-dollar asset managers to small nations\u2019 treasuries \u2013 but collectively they signal that **Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies have entered the portfolios of serious, credible investors globally**. Many of these investors bring **strong track records and fact-driven approaches**, lending legitimacy to crypto. At the same time, the **culture of speculative hype** has not disappeared: some players undeniably exhibit promotional zeal or overly rosy predictions. Yet, the trend is that as the stakes get higher, more of these investors temper hype with realism (e.g. central bankers analyzing volatility, hedge funders stressing risk limits).\n\nFinally, **long-term holders from previous cycles remain a backbone** of the market \u2013 the data shows they\u2019re largely still \u201cin,\u201d having held or even grown their positions. Their continued presence (and the entrance of new long-term-minded institutions like insurance companies and sovereign funds) indicates that the **credibility of cryptocurrency as a long-duration asset** has only strengthened. While short-term sentiment will ebb and flow, these accumulators \u2013 big and small, public and private \u2013 suggest a rising baseline of committed interest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto asset class, now and for the long run\u30109\u2020L26-L33\u3011\u301010\u2020L924-L932\u3011.\n\n**Sources:** Connected inline throughout the text for reference to data and statements."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":763,"end_ix":779,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"image_inline","asset_pointer_links":[],"clicked_from_url":null,"clicked_from_title":null}},{"start_ix":899,"end_ix":913,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Who Owns the Most Bitcoin in 2025? | River","url":"https://river.com/learn/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin/#:~:text=ETFs%20and%20other%20funds%20own,approximately%20530%2C831%20BTC%20under%20management","text":"ETFs and other funds own a combined 1,250,000 BTC, 5.90% of the total bitcoin supply.
