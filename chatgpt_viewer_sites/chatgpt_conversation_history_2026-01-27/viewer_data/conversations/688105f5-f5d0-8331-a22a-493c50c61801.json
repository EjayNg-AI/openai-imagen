Just like we won the space race, it is imperative that the United States \r\nand its allies win this race. President Trump took decisive steps toward achieving this goal\r\nduringhis first days in office by signing Executive Order 14179, \u201cRemoving Barriers to American \r\nLeadership in Artificial Intelligence,\u201d calling for America to retain dominance in this global race \r\nand directing the creation of an AI Action Plan.1\r\n \r\nWinning the AI race will usher in a new golden age of human flourishing, economic \r\ncompetitiveness, and national security for the American people. AI will enable Americans to \r\ndiscover new materials, synthesize new chemicals, manufacture new drugs, and develop new \r\nmethods to harness energy\u2014an industrial revolution. It will enable radically new forms of \r\neducation, media, and communication\u2014an information revolution. And it will enable \r\naltogether new intellectual achievements: unraveling ancient scrolls once thought \r\nunreadable, making breakthroughs in scientific and mathematical theory, and creating new \r\nkinds of digital and physical art\u2014a renaissance. \r\nAn industrial revolution, an information revolution, and a renaissance\u2014all at once. This is the \r\npotential that AI presents. The opportunity that stands before us is both inspiring and \r\nhumbling. And it is ours to seize, or to lose. \r\nAmerica\u2019s AI Action Plan has three pillars: innovation, infrastructure, and international \r\ndiplomacy and security. The United States needs to innovate faster and more \r\ncomprehensively than our competitors in the development and distribution of new AI \r\ntechnology across every field, and dismantle unnecessary regulatory barriers that hinder the \r\nprivate sector in doing so. As Vice President Vance remarked at the Paris AI Action Summit in \r\nFebruary, restricting AI development with onerous regulation \u201cwould not only unfairly benefit \r\nincumbents\u2026 it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen \r\nin generations.\u201d2 That is why President Trump rescinded the Biden Administration\u2019s \r\ndangerous actions on day one.\r\nWe need to build and maintain vast AI infrastructure and the energy to power it. To do that, we \r\nwill continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration \r\nhas done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u201cBuild, Baby, Build!\u201d \r\nWe need to establish American AI\u2014from our advanced semiconductors to our models to our \r\napplications\u2014as the gold standard for AI worldwide and ensure our allies are building on \r\nAmerican technology. \r\nSeveral principles cut across each of these three pillars. First, American workers are central to\r\nthe Trump Administration\u2019s AI policy. The Administration will ensure that our Nation\u2019s workers \r\nand their families gain from the opportunities created in this technological revolution. The AI \r\ninfrastructure buildout will create high-paying jobs for American workers.

AI will improve the lives of Americans by \r\ncomplementing their work\u2014not replacing it. \r\nSecond, our AI systems must be free from ideological bias and be designed to pursue objective \r\ntruth rather than social engineering agendas when users seek factual information or analysis. \r\nAI systems are becoming essential tools, profoundly shaping how Americans consume \r\ninformation, but these tools must also be trustworthy. \r\nFinally, we must prevent our advanced technologies from being misused or stolen by malicious \r\nactors as well as monitor for emerging and unforeseen risks from AI. Doing so will require \r\nconstant vigilance. \r\nThis Action Plan sets forth clear policy goals for near-term execution by the Federal \r\ngovernment.

Achieving these goals requires \r\nthe Federal government to create the conditions where private-sector-led innovation can \r\nflourish. \r\nRemove Red Tape and Onerous Regulation\r\nTo maintain global leadership in AI, America\u2019s private sector must be unencumbered by \r\nbureaucratic red tape. President Trump has already taken multiple steps toward this goal, \r\nincluding rescinding Biden Executive Order 14110 on AI that foreshadowed an onerous \r\nregulatory regime.\r\n3 AI is far too important to smother in bureaucracy at this early stage, \r\nwhether at the state or Federal level. The Federal government should not allow AI-related \r\nFederalfunding to be directed toward states with burdensome AI regulations that waste these \r\nfunds, but should also not interfere with states\u2019 rights to pass prudent laws that are not unduly \r\nrestrictive to innovation.\r\nRecommended Policy Actions\r\n\u2022 Led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), launch a Request for \r\nInformation from businesses and the public at large about current Federal regulations \r\nthat hinder AI innovation and adoption, and work with relevant Federal agencies to take \r\nappropriate action.\r\n\u2022 Led by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consistent with Executive \r\nOrder 14192 of January 31, 2025, \u201cUnleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,\u201d work \r\nwith all Federal agencies to identify, revise, or repeal regulations, rules, memoranda, \r\nadministrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency \r\nagreements that unnecessarily hinder AI development or deployment.4\r\n\u2022 Led by OMB, work with Federal agencies that have AI-related discretionary funding \r\nprograms to ensure, consistent with applicable law, that they consider a state\u2019s AI \r\nregulatory climate when making funding decisions and limit funding if the state\u2019s AI \r\nregulatory regimes may hinder the effectiveness of that funding or award. \r\n\u2022 Led by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), evaluate whether state AI \r\nregulations interfere with the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities \r\nunder the Communications Act of 1934.5\r\n\u2022 Review all Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigations commenced under the \r\nprevious administration to ensure that they do not advance theories of liability that \r\nunduly burden AI innovation.

It is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech \r\nand expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective. \r\nWe must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal \r\ngovernment objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas. \r\nRecommended Policy Actions\r\n\u2022 Led by the Department of Commerce (DOC) through the National Institute of \r\nStandards and Technology (NIST), revise the NIST AI Risk Management Framework to \r\neliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate \r\nchange. 6\r\n \r\n\u2022 Update Federal procurement guidelines to ensure that the government only contracts \r\nwith frontier large language model (LLM) developers who ensure that their systems are \r\nobjective and free from top-down ideological bias.\r\n\u2022 Led by DOC through NIST\u2019s Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI), conduct \r\nresearch and, as appropriate, publish evaluations of frontier models from the People\u2019s \r\nRepublic of China for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and \r\ncensorship.\r\nEncourage Open-Source and Open-Weight AI\r\nOpen-source and open-weight AI models are made freely available by developers for anyone \r\nin the world to download and modify. Models distributed this way have unique value for \r\ninnovation because startups can use them flexibly without being dependent on a closed model \r\nprovider. They also benefit commercial and government adoption of AI because many \r\nbusinesses and governments have sensitive data that they cannot send to closed model \r\nvendors. And they are essential for academic research, which often relies on access to the \r\nweights and training data of a model to perform scientifically rigorous experiments. \r\nWe need to ensure America has leading open models founded on American values. Open\u0002source and open-weight models could become global standards in some areas of business and \r\nin academic research worldwide. For that reason, they also have geostrategic value. While the \r\ndecision of whether and how to release an open or closed model is fundamentally up to the \r\ndeveloper, the Federal government should create a supportive environment for open models. \r\nRecommended Policy Actions\r\n\u2022 Ensure access to large-scale computing power for startups and academics by \r\nimproving the financial market for compute. Currently, a company seeking to use large\u0002scale compute must often sign long-term contracts with hyperscalers\u2014far beyond the \r\n6 National Institute of Standards and Technology, \u201cArtificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0),\u201d \r\n(Gaithersburg, MD: National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2023), www.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-1.

Through collaboration with industry, NIST at DOC, OSTP, and \r\nthe National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot, \r\nthe Federal government can accelerate the maturation of a healthy financial market for \r\ncompute. \r\n\u2022 Partner with leading technology companies to increase the research community\u2019s \r\naccess to world-class private sector computing, models, data, and software resources\r\nas part of the NAIRR pilot.\r\n\u2022 Build the foundations for a lean and sustainable NAIRR operations capability that can \r\nconnect an increasing number of researchers and educators across the country to \r\ncritical AI resources. \r\n\u2022 Continue to foster the next generation of AI breakthroughs by publishing a new National \r\nAI Research and Development (R&D) Strategic Plan, led by OSTP, to guide Federal AI \r\nresearch investments.\r\n\u2022 Led by DOC through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration \r\n(NTIA), convene stakeholders to help drive adoption of open-source and open-weight \r\nmodels by small and medium-sized businesses.\r\nEnable AI Adoption\r\nToday, the bottleneck to harnessing AI\u2019s full potential is not necessarily the availability of \r\nmodels, tools, or applications. Rather, it is the limited and slow adoption of AI, particularly \r\nwithin large, established organizations. Many of America\u2019s most critical sectors, such as \r\nhealthcare, are especially slow to adopt due to a variety of factors, including distrust or lack of \r\nunderstanding of the technology, a complex regulatory landscape, and a lack of clear \r\ngovernance and risk mitigation standards. A coordinated Federal effort would be beneficial in \r\nestablishing a dynamic, \u201ctry-first\u201d culture for AI across American industry.\r\nRecommended Policy Actions\r\n\u2022 Establish regulatory sandboxes or AI Centers of Excellence around the country where \r\nresearchers, startups, and established enterprises can rapidly deploy and test AI tools \r\nwhile committing to open sharing of data and results. These efforts would be enabled\r\nby regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the \r\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with support from DOC through its AI \r\nevaluation initiatives at NIST.\r\n\u2022 Launch several domain-specific efforts (e.g., in healthcare, energy, and agriculture), led \r\nby NIST at DOC,to convene a broad range of public, private, and academic stakeholders \r\nto accelerate the development and adoption of national standards for AI systems and to \r\nmeasure how much AI increases productivity at realistic tasks in those domains. \r\n\u2022 Led by the Department of Defense (DOD) in coordination with the Office of the Director \r\nof National Intelligence (ODNI), regularly update joint DOD-Intelligence Community \r\n(IC) assessments of the comparative level of adoption of AI tools by the United States, \r\nits competitors, and its adversaries\u2019 national security establishments, and establish an ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 28>","AMERICA\u2019S AI ACTION PLAN\r\n6 \r\napproach for continuous adaptation of the DOD and IC\u2019s respective AI adoption \r\ninitiatives based on these AI net assessments. \r\n\u2022 Prioritize, collect, and distribute intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that may \r\nhave national security implications, via collaboration between the IC, the Department of \r\nEnergy (DOE), CAISI at DOC, the National Security Council (NSC), and OSTP. \r\nEmpower American Workers in the Age of AI\r\nThe Trump Administration supports a worker-first AI agenda.

AI will enable Americans to \r\n[L8] discover new materials, synthesize new chemicals, manufacture new drugs, and develop new \r\n[L9] methods to harness energy\u2014an industrial revolution. It will enable radically new forms of \r\n[L10] education, media, and communication\u2014an information revolution. And it will enable \r\n[L11] altogether new intellectual achievements: unraveling ancient scrolls once thought \r\n[L12] unreadable, making breakthroughs in scientific and mathematical theory, and creating new \r\n[L13] kinds of digital and physical art\u2014a renaissance. \r\n[L14] An industrial revolution, an information revolution, and a renaissance\u2014all at once. This is the \r\n[L15] potential that AI presents. The opportunity that stands before us is both inspiring and \r\n[L16] humbling. And it is ours to seize, or to lose. \r\n[L17] America\u2019s AI Action Plan has three pillars: innovation, infrastructure, and international \r\n[L18] diplomacy and security. The United States needs to innovate faster and more \r\n[L19] comprehensively than our competitors in the development and distribution of new AI \r\n[L20] technology across every field, and dismantle unnecessary regulatory barriers that hinder the \r\n[L21] private sector in doing so. As Vice President Vance remarked at the Paris AI Action Summit in \r\n[L22] February, restricting AI development with onerous regulation \u201cwould not only unfairly benefit \r\n[L23] incumbents\u2026 it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen \r\n[L24] in generations.\u201d2 That is why President Trump rescinded the Biden Administration\u2019s \r\n[L25] dangerous actions on day one.\r\n[L26] We need to build and maintain vast AI infrastructure and the energy to power it. To do that, we \r\n[L27] will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration \r\n[L28] has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to \u201cBuild, Baby, Build!\u201d \r\n[L29] We need to establish American AI\u2014from our advanced semiconductors to our models to our \r\n[L30] applications\u2014as the gold standard for AI worldwide and ensure our allies are building on \r\n[L31] American technology. \r\n[L32] Several principles cut across each of these three pillars. First, American workers are central to\r\n[L33] the Trump Administration\u2019s AI policy. The Administration will ensure that our Nation\u2019s workers \r\n[L34] and their families gain from the opportunities created in this technological revolution.

As Vice President Vance remarked at the Paris AI Action Summit in \r\n[L53] February, restricting AI development with onerous regulation \u201cwould not only unfairly benefit \r\n[L54] incumbents\u2026 it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen \r\n[L55] in generations.\u201d2 That is why President Trump rescinded the Biden Administration\u2019s \r\n[L56] dangerous actions on day one.\n# \u30104\u2020Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\u2020file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"1:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] While much work has been \r\n[L2] done to advance the field of AI Assurance, promoting resilient and secure AI development and \r\n[L3] deployment should be a core activity of the U.S. government.\r\n[L4] Recommended Policy Actions\r\n[L5] \u2022 Led by DOD in collaboration with NIST at DOC and ODNI, continue to refine DOD\u2019s \r\n[L6] Responsible AI and Generative AI Frameworks, Roadmaps, and Toolkits. \r\n[L7] \u2022 Led by ODNI in consultation with DOD and CAISI at DOC, publish an IC Standard on AI \r\n[L8] Assurance under the auspices of Intelligence Community Directive 505 on Artificial \r\n[L9] Intelligence. <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 28>AMERICA\u2019S AI ACTION PLAN\r\n[L10] 19\r\n[L11] Promote Mature Federal Capacity for AI Incident Response\r\n[L12] The proliferation of AI technologies means that prudent planning is required to ensure that, if \r\n[L13] systems fail, the impacts to critical services or infrastructure are minimized and response is \r\n[L14] imminent.

Strategic Vision & Structure  \nThe plan frames AI as a domain\u2011defining technology race that the United States \u201cmust win,\u201d paralleling the Cold\u2011War space race.

Domestic Ramifications  \n\n| Domain | Intent | Immediate Effects | Medium\u2011term Risks |\n|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Regulation** | Strip \u201conerous\u201d rules; preference for deregulation; condition some Federal funds on states\u2019 regulatory posture. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file3\ue202L43-L49\ue201 | Faster product cycles; lower compliance costs; advantage to agile startups. | Safety, privacy and bias safeguards may lag; states with tougher rules (e.g., California) could become AI \u201cislands.\u201d |\n| **Open\u2011Source & Free\u2011Speech Mandates** | Promote open\u2011weight models and insist on viewpoint\u2011neutral federal procurement. | Broader access for SMEs and researchers; potential renaissance of U.S. open AI stacks. | Adversaries gain easier access; hard to audit compliance with \u201cno ideological bias\u201d clauses. |\n| **Infrastructure & Energy** | NEPA and Clean Water Act shortcuts; \u201cBuild\u2011Baby\u2011Build\u201d grid expansion; federal land for data\u2011centers; revive nuclear, geothermal. | Acceleration of hyperscale build\u2011outs; job creation in energy and construction trades; more resilient compute supply. | Environmental\u2011justice challenges, regional power\u2011price spikes, supply\u2011chain strain (HV transformers, skilled labor). |\n| **Semiconductor Sovereignty** | Refocus CHIPS Office on ROI and \u201cextraneous policy removals\u201d; fast\u2011track fab permitting. | Keeps advanced nodes onshore; buffers against Taiwan risk. | Subsidy fatigue in Congress; global fab over\u2011capacity if China and EU also stay the course. |\n| **Workforce Strategy** | Apprenticeships, rapid retraining and middle\u2011skill pathways framed as *worker\u2011first* AI agenda. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L7-L10\ue201 | Retains political support; addresses talent gaps in trades (electricians, HVAC, fab techs). | Execution burden rests on state systems historically slow to modernise curricula. |\n| **Security & Incident Response** | Secure\u2011by\u2011design standards, AI\u2011ISAC, classified \u201chigh\u2011security\u201d clouds for DoD/IC. | Closes evident gaps exposed by Log4Shell\u2011style vulns and by foreign model backdoors. | Fragmentation of AI cyber norms; higher barriers for vendors lacking FedRAMP\u2011plus clearances. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. International Ramifications  \n\n* **Alliance\u2011centred export strategy** \u2013 DOC is tasked to broker \u201cfull\u2011stack AI\u201d packages\u2014chips to models\u2014for friendly nations, explicitly to block Chinese alternatives. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file4\ue202L41-L46\ue201  \n* **Standards Diplomacy vs. China** \u2013 The plan singles out PRC attempts to steer UN/ITU norms and pledges U.S. counter\u2011campaigns.  \n* **Tightened export controls** \u2013 Location\u2011verified GPUs, end\u2011use monitoring, and foreign\u2011direct\u2011product extensions aim to seal remaining loopholes.  \n* **Bio\u2011 and cyber\u2011security overlays** \u2013 Sequence\u2011provider screening and AI vulnerability disclosure regimes foreshadow a global compliance club akin to the Wassenaar Arrangement, but for AI.  \n\n**Likely geopolitical effects**\n\n| Actor | Probable Response |\n|-------|------------------|\n| **China** | Doubling\u2011down on indigenous GPU ecosystem (SMIC\u202f+\u202fBiren); pressing Belt\u2011and\u2011Road partners to adopt PRC cloud/LLMs to escape U.S. export reach. |\n| **EU** | Faces a fork: align with U.S. tech stack or entrench AI Act\u2011style sovereignty. Likely to push for mutual\u2011recognition of safety regimes while resisting blanket deregulation. |\n| **Middle powers (India, GCC, ASEAN)** | Welcome subsidised U.S. stack if financing terms beat PRC offers; will hedge to maximise leverage. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Net Impact on the Global AI Race  \n\n1. **Acceleration effect** \u2013 Removing federal red\u2011tape and incentivising open\u2011source lowers U.S. developer friction; early\u2011stage companies gain at the expense of heavily\u2011regulated incumbents.  \n2. **Compute & energy bottlenecks** \u2013 The plan correctly spots grid capacity as the new choke\u2011point. If permitting relief passes, the U.S. could out\u2011build China on *secure* datacentre wattage by 2027; if lawsuits stall reforms, the edge disappears.  \n3. **Talent & supply\u2011chain** \u2013 Aggressive trade\u2011school upskilling may alleviate blue\u2011collar shortages faster than China can solve its advanced\u2011node fab IP gap\u2014if states execute.  \n4. **Allied ecosystems** \u2013 By bundling hardware\u2011plus\u2011model exports, Washington can lock friendly nations into its standards, diluting Beijing\u2019s international sway.  \n5. **Risk profile** \u2013 Rapid open\u2011weight diffusion raises the ceiling for innovation *and* misuse. Success hinges on whether proposed evaluation, incident\u2011response and bio\u2011screening layers mature at the same speed.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Critical Assessment  \n\n| Strengths | Weaknesses / Open Questions |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| Coherent linkage of innovation, physical capacity and diplomacy\u2014rare in prior AI strategies. | Heavy reliance on deregulation may clash with bipartisan calls for algorithmic accountability. |\n| Explicit attention to energy/grid realities\u2014often neglected in EU or Chinese roadmaps. | \u201cFree\u2011speech aligned\u201d procurement lacks a rigorous, testable definition\u2014risk of politicising model audits. |\n| Integrates workforce development early, not as after\u2011thought. | Grid build\u2011out timelines (5\u201110\u202fyrs) lag AI model cycles (12\u201118\u202fmo); interim power crunches are plausible. |\n| Uses export controls as geostrategic lever while offering carrots (full\u2011stack packages). | Allies may bristle at secondary tariffs or extraterritorial FDPR measures; coalition cohesion is not guaranteed. |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Forward\u2011Looking Scenarios  \n\n1. **Full\u2011Throttle Execution (40\u202f% probability)**  \n   *Permitting shortcuts survive court challenges; >15\u202fGW of new datacentre capacity online by 2028.*  \n   **Outcome:** U.S. retains clear compute lead; China focuses on regional sphere; EU harmonises safety standards with U.S.\n\n2. **Regulatory Whiplash (30\u202f%)**  \n   *Congress or courts reinstate portions of Biden\u2011era AI order; state patchwork widens.*  \n   **Outcome:** Uncertainty slows capital spending; open\u2011source flourishes in gray zones; gap with China narrows.\n\n3. **Fragmented Alliances (20\u202f%)**  \n   *Key partners (e.g., India) resist U.S. export\u2011control alignment; accept PRC subsidies.*  \n   **Outcome:** Bifurcated global AI markets; security externalities (bio, cyber) harder to police.\n\n4. **Energy Shortfall Shock (10\u202f%)**  \n   *Delayed grid upgrades force rolling AI compute rationing in major hubs.*  \n   **Outcome:** Capital and talent migrate to energy\u2011rich allies (Canada, Norway); U.S. strategic narrative weakened.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Bottom Line  \n\nThe Action Plan is *maximally competitive*: it bets on deregulation, industrial muscle, and hard\u2011power diplomacy to entrench U.S. primacy. If its infrastructure and workforce planks are executed as quickly as the deregulatory ones, Washington is positioned to widen\u2014perhaps not close\u2014the compute and model\u2011quality gap with Beijing through the late\u20112020s.  \n\nIts Achilles\u2019 heels are **grid timing, legal challenges, and coalition management**. Should any two of these stumble simultaneously, the global AI race reverts to a multipolar contest where *no single bloc* enjoys decisive dominance."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":491,"end_ix":520,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":1,"retrieval_file_index":1,"cited_message_idx":18,"cited_message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","search_result_idx":1,"line_range":[58,63],"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":521,"end_ix":550,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":1,"retrieval_file_index":3,"cited_message_idx":18,"cited_message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","search_result_idx":3,"line_range":[48,50],"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":843,"end_ix":872,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":1,"retrieval_file_index":3,"cited_message_idx":18,"cited_message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","search_result_idx":3,"line_range":[43,49],"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":2187,"end_ix":2215,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":1,"retrieval_file_index":2,"cited_message_idx":18,"cited_message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","search_result_idx":2,"line_range":[7,10],"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":2915,"end_ix":2944,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":1,"retrieval_file_index":4,"cited_message_idx":18,"cited_message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","search_result_idx":4,"line_range":[41,46],"cloud_doc_url":null}}}],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file1\ue202L58-L63\ue201","start_idx":491,"end_idx":520,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":1,"message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","file_index":1,"line_range_start":58,"line_range_end":63},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file3\ue202L48-L50\ue201","start_idx":521,"end_idx":550,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":1,"message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","file_index":3,"line_range_start":48,"line_range_end":50},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file3\ue202L43-L49\ue201","start_idx":843,"end_idx":872,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":1,"message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","file_index":3,"line_range_start":43,"line_range_end":49},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L7-L10\ue201","start_idx":2187,"end_idx":2215,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":1,"message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","file_index":2,"line_range_start":7,"line_range_end":10},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file4\ue202L41-L46\ue201","start_idx":2915,"end_idx":2944,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf","id":"file-WdrS983mgBt9zrAqX8upAY","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":1,"message_id":"fdd5e487-79b4-447a-bd9a-3c5cbfbd17ac","file_index":4,"line_range_start":41,"line_range_end":46},"fff_metadata":null}],"request_id":"963c5cd34e8b5fd4-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"9c21a683-223e-4c29-95a6-10c202d0936d","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"9c21a683-223e-4c29-95a6-10c202d0936d","children":["cb52cafd-240d-45de-b176-ccb2e94d7227"]},"cb52cafd-240d-45de-b176-ccb2e94d7227":{"id":"cb52cafd-240d-45de-b176-ccb2e94d7227","message":{"id":"cb52cafd-240d-45de-b176-ccb2e94d7227","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753291942.783,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Examine

Administration\u2019s drive for deregulated, hardware\u2011intensive, export\u2011controlled AI growth**, Singapore can position itself as:\n\n* **The trusted overflow compute zone** that U.S. firms need while they battle domestic energy and permitting delays.  \n* **The world\u2019s safety and compliance arbiter** through AI\u202fVerify, TMX and red\u2011team centres, balancing speed (favoured by Washington) with guard\u2011rails (valued by allies and markets).  \n* **An advanced\u2011packaging and chiplet nexus**\u2014critical to next\u2011gen AI accelerators and neatly complementary to U.S. onshore wafer fabs.  \n* **A magnet for top global talent and capital**, expanding its AI workforce well beyond current NAIS 2.0 ambitions.\n\nIf executed with the proposed timeline, Singapore becomes *indispensable* to both the U.S. AI strategy and the wider global ecosystem\u2014fulfilling all four of the Government\u2019s stated objectives by early\u2011next\u2011decade."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201","start_idx":353,"end_idx":370,"safe_urls":["https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/singapore-artificial-intelligence-strategy-20"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Trade.gov](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/singapore-artificial-intelligence-strategy-20))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Singapore

every major actor is piloting red\u2011team exercises, but metrics and benchmarking regimes are still fragmented.\n\n#### 3.2\u2003Major Geopolitical Actors and Their AI Roadmaps  \n\n**United\u202fStates.**  The incoming Trump Administration\u2019s *AI Action Plan* represents the most aggressive industrial policy shift since the original CHIPS Act.\u202fIt combines extensive deregulation with accelerated domestic build\u2011outs of data\u2011centre and energy capacity, and it couples those incentives to stringent export\u2011control updates that aim to deny advanced GPUs and fabrication know\u2011how to strategic competitors.\u202fThe Commerce Department\u2019s October\u202f2023 rules already prohibit shipment of top\u2011bin accelerators to the People\u2019s Republic of China and subject third\u2011country re\u2011exports to a foreign\u2011direct\u2011product regime \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201.\u202fUnder the new plan, similar controls will tighten further, but the United States also pledges to make \u201cfull\u2011stack\u201d AI packages\u2014chips, models and cloud capacity\u2014available at preferential terms to trusted partners.\n\n**China.**  Beijing responded to the October\u202f2023 export controls by fast\u2011tracking indigenous GPU development and by mandating a sovereign cloud stack.\u202fRegulatory efforts have concentrated on content governance.\u202fThe *Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services* (August\u202f2023) require providers to register training data, implement real\u2011name verification and submit security assessments before public deployment \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201.\u202fSubsequent guidance in 2025 refined the rules, signalling a pragmatic balance between ideological control and export ambitions for Chinese foundation models \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201.\n\n**European Union.**  The bloc\u2019s strategy remains regulation\u2011led.\u202fThe EU\u202fAI\u202fAct, published in the Official Journal on 12\u202fJuly\u202f2024, classifies AI systems by risk tier, imposes mandatory conformity assessments for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d applications and outright bans certain biometric and cognitive manipulation uses \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201.\u202fAlthough most provisions enter into force in 2026, the Act has already reshaped corporate roadmaps: major U.S. vendors are preparing \u201cEU modes\u201d for their models, and Microsoft has signalled support for a voluntary code of practice that complements the Act \ue200cite\ue202turn0news37\ue201.\u202fEurope\u2019s emphasis on trustworthy AI gives it soft\u2011power influence over global norms but slows commercialisation cycles relative to the United States and China.\n\n**Middle Powers.**  Countries such as India, South\u202fKorea, Japan and the oil\u2011rich Gulf states view AI as a lever for economic diversification and strategic autonomy.\u202fThey are courting both U.S. and Chinese technology stacks while pledging green\u2011energy baseloads to attract data\u2011centre investment.\u202fTheir regulatory stance is generally light\u2011touch, designed to import talent and capital rapidly.\u202fCollectively they represent the swing constituency whose alignment could tip supply\u2011chain dominance one way or the other.\n\n#### 3.3\u2003Competitive Dynamics and Emerging Supply\u2011Chain Bottlenecks  \n\nThe contest for AI leadership increasingly turns on three bottlenecks: **advanced chips, grid\u2011level energy and specialised talent.**  The United States retains design leadership and, via export controls, can channel access to cutting\u2011edge GPUs.\u202fChina controls a commanding share of rare\u2011earth refining, essential for permanent magnets in both chip manufacturing equipment and data\u2011centre cooling systems.\u202fEurope governs the world\u2019s most comprehensive AI safety rule\u2011set, and through the EU\u202fAI\u202fAct can influence how models are validated globally.\n\nSecuring sufficient electricity is becoming as strategic as securing silicon.\u202fPower\u2011hungry hyperscale campuses are testing national grids; in markets with high renewable penetration the intermittency challenge is acute.\u202fRegions capable of offering firm, low\u2011carbon power at scale\u2014hydro\u2011rich Scandinavia, nuclear France and Canada, or gas\u2011abundant Gulf states\u2014are emerging as coveted training locations.\u202fFinally, the global pool of senior AI researchers remains thin.\u202fVisa accelerators in the United States and the United Kingdom, alongside China\u2019s domestic talent repatriation programmes, are intensifying competition for the top percentile of researchers and silicon engineers.\n\n#### 3.4\u2003Implications for Small, Advanced Economies  \n\nFor nimble yet resource\u2011constrained states such as Singapore, the coming landscape is both perilous and opportune.\u202fExport\u2011control gatekeeping by Washington could choke direct access to state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art GPUs unless robust end\u2011use assurances are in place, while Europe\u2019s rules may raise compliance costs for firms servicing EU customers.\u202fConversely, the very existence of these friction points creates a market for *trusted intermediaries*\u2014jurisdictions able to offer secure overflow compute, rigorous yet non\u2011stifling safety evaluation, and reliable green energy in a geopolitically neutral setting.\u202fSingapore\u2019s established semiconductor packaging base, world\u2011class digital infrastructure and diplomatic credibility position it to play precisely that bridging role, provided that national constraints on land, labour and power are addressed at pace.\n\nThe next chapter evaluates how far Singapore\u2019s current assets and policies already align with these global currents, where critical gaps remain, and how the Republic can convert structural constraints into strategic leverage as the AI race accelerates towards 2030."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":618,"end_idx":637,"safe_urls":["https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI to drive 165% increase in data center power demand by 2030","url":"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1738627200.0,"snippet":"Goldman Sachs Research forecasts global power demand from data centers will increase 50% by 2027 and by as much as 165% by the end of the decade.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Goldman Sachs"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201","start_idx":813,"end_idx":833,"safe_urls":["https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3572-1.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3572-1.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI's Power Requirements Under Exponential Growth","url":"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3572-1.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1738022400.0,"snippet":"Global AI data center power demand could reach 68 GW by 2027 and 327 GW by 2030, compared with total global data center capacity of just 88 GW ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"RAND Corporation"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":2151,"end_idx":2171,"safe_urls":["https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/25/2023-23055/implementation-of-additional-export-controls-certain-advanced-computing-items-supercomputer-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/25/2023-23055/implementation-of-additional-export-controls-certain-advanced-computing-items-supercomputer-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Implementation of Additional Export Controls: Certain Advanced ...","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/25/2023-23055/implementation-of-additional-export-controls-certain-advanced-computing-items-supercomputer-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1698192000.0,"snippet":"The October 7 IFR imposed controls on two sets of items and activities.

The document also foregrounds generative AI, signalling government intent to shape\u2014not merely respond to\u2014frontier model development.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search9\ue201  \n\nProgress since the launch has been tangible.  A refreshed AI Apprenticeship Programme has doubled intakes; grant calls under the RIE\u20112025 fund now ring\u2011fence S$300\u202fmillion for foundation\u2011model research; and regulatory sandboxes for privacy\u2011enhancing technologies in finance were opened in early\u202f2025.  Yet several milestones\u2014most visibly the establishment of an \u201ciconic\u201d national compute site and the mid\u2011decade talent KPI\u2014remain on the horizon, underscoring the importance of sustained execution capacity across government and industry.  \n\n#### 4.2\u202fStructural Strengths  \n\n##### 4.2.1\u202fDigital Infrastructure and Data\u2011Centre Capacity  \n\nAfter a four\u2011year pause on new hyperscale builds, the government in May\u202f2024 unveiled a Green Data Centre Roadmap that releases at least **300\u202fMW** of additional capacity, on top of the city\u2011state\u2019s existing 1.4\u202fGW.\ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  The roadmap links new allocations to best\u2011in\u2011class energy\u2011efficiency standards (target PUE\u202f\u2264\u202f1.3) and privileges operators able to secure low\u2011carbon power.  Combined with world\u2011leading submarine\u2011cable density, the policy fortifies Singapore\u2019s position as Southeast Asia\u2019s primary interconnection hub\u2014a foundational asset for any AI cluster that thrives on low\u2011latency global links.  \n\n##### 4.2.2\u202fSemiconductor and Advanced\u2011Packaging Ecosystem  \n\nOne in every ten chips worldwide is produced in Singapore, which also accounts for roughly 20\u202fpercent of global semiconductor\u2011equipment output.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201  The manufacturing base spans mature\u2011node wafer fabs, specialty materials and a growing cadre of advanced\u2011packaging lines.  In May\u202f2025, GlobalFoundries and A*STAR signed a memorandum to co\u2011develop chiplet and photonics packaging, cementing the island as the group\u2019s Asian centre for next\u2011generation assembly and test.\ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201  When coupled with the S$3\u202fbillion top\u2011up to semiconductor R&D announced in Budget\u202f2025, the result is a vertically integrated ecosystem uniquely complementary to U.S. on\u2011shore wafer fabrication and therefore well placed to benefit from allied supply\u2011chain diversification.  \n\n##### 4.2.3\u202fGovernance Leadership and Technical Assurance  \n\nSingapore has moved early to translate principles of trustworthy AI into operational tools.  **AI\u202fVerify**, first launched in 2022 and open\u2011sourced on GitHub in mid\u20112023, provides a testing framework mapped to the U.S. NIST AI\u202fRMF, ISO\u202f42001 and the Hiroshima Code of Conduct; its May\u202f2025 update extends coverage to generative models.\ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  Concurrently, the **Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities**, issued in April\u202f2025 after a gathering of more than 100 international scholars, positions the Republic as a neutral convener of technical safety dialogue at a time when U.S. and Chinese fora rarely intersect.\ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  These initiatives give the government both normative influence and practical artefacts\u2014auditing protocols, red\u2011team taxonomy\u2014that can be exported alongside AI products.  \n\n##### 4.2.4\u202fGeostrategic Neutrality and Diplomatic Networks  \n\nSingapore\u2019s long\u2011standing posture of principled neutrality enables the country to work with all major technology blocs without slipping into zero\u2011sum alignment.  The March\u202f2025 agreement for Oracle to stand\u2011up an **air\u2011gapped sovereign cloud and generative\u2011AI stack for MINDEF** marks the first such U.S. deployment in Southeast Asia, signalling Washington\u2019s confidence that sensitive workloads can be hosted securely on Singaporean soil.\ue200cite\ue202turn8search0\ue201  At the same time, Singapore continues to engage Beijing in ASEAN digital\u2011economy initiatives and retains an influential voice in the G\u201120 Digital Ministers process.  This diplomatic dexterity is vital for a trade\u2011dependent city\u2011state navigating increasingly fractured technology spheres.  \n\n#### 4.3\u202fGaps and Constraints  \n\n##### 4.3.1\u202fEnergy and Land Limits  \n\nWith more than 95\u202fpercent of electricity still generated from imported natural gas, incremental data\u2011centre builds intensify decarbonisation and security challenges.  The Energy Market Authority\u2019s pledge to import **4\u202fGW of low\u2011carbon electricity by 2035**\u2014equivalent to about one\u2011third of projected demand\u2014marks strategic progress but underscores Singapore\u2019s structural reliance on cross\u2011border grids whose build\u2011out pace is uncertain.\ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  Land scarcity further constrains the siting of new hyperscale facilities and on\u2011island renewable projects, making every megawatt of AI compute a high\u2011opportunity\u2011cost choice.  \n\n##### 4.3.2\u202fTalent Pipeline Shortfalls  \n\nAlthough the NAIS\u202f2.0 targets are clear, the domestic supply of senior AI researchers and specialised silicon engineers remains tight.  Competition from the United States, China and Europe for the same scarce skills risks slowing local project timelines.  Moreover, public debates over foreign\u2011talent visas could limit the rate at which top\u2011tier scientists relocate, even as new programmes such as Tech.Pass\u2011AI begin to gain traction.  \n\n##### 4.3.3\u202fScale of Domestic Demand  \n\nSingapore\u2019s internal market of six million people cannot on its own justify sustained frontier\u2011model training cycles or the largest GPU farms.  The ecosystem has therefore relied on multinational tenants anchoring compute demand, exposing it to relocation risk if cross\u2011border policy shocks\u2014export controls, data\u2011residency mandates\u2014alter cost\u2011benefit calculations.  \n\n#### 4.4\u202fOverall Assessment  \n\nSingapore enters the second half of the decade with a rare combination of hard assets\u2014secure digital infrastructure, a world\u2011class semiconductor base\u2014and soft power\u2014globally respected governance frameworks and diplomatic credibility.  These strengths align neatly with the external environment shaped by the U.S. AI Action Plan: Washington needs overflow compute in friendly jurisdictions, robust safety evaluation partners and advanced\u2011packaging capacity outside mainland China.  Yet structural constraints on power, land and human capital could blunt competitive advantage if not addressed with equal urgency.  The balance of opportunity and risk crystallises into a strategic imperative: convert neutrality and agility into indispensability before supply\u2011chain realignments settle into new defaults.  \n\nThe next chapter analyses how the United States\u2019 AI Action Plan reshapes the opportunity set described above, detailing specific alignment possibilities, exposure points and the net strategic calculus for Singapore\u2019s policymakers."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201","start_idx":398,"end_idx":417,"safe_urls":["https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/singapore-artificial-intelligence-strategy-20?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Trade.gov](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/singapore-artificial-intelligence-strategy-20?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Singapore

The first pillar\u2014**Accelerate Innovation**\u2014cuts compliance costs for domestic developers by rolling back federal rule\u2011making, tying future regulations to \u201cinnovation impact assessments,\u201d and strongly favouring open\u2011weight models in government procurement.  The second pillar\u2014**Build AI Infrastructure**\u2014creates fast\u2011track permits for data\u2011centre construction, shortens environmental reviews for grid upgrades, revives nuclear and geothermal projects, and layers new tax credits on top of CHIPS\u202fAct incentives to keep advanced semiconductor nodes onshore.  The third pillar\u2014**Lead in International AI Diplomacy and Security**\u2014tightens export controls on cutting\u2011edge GPUs and lithography tools while offering allies complete \u201cfull\u2011stack\u201d packages\u2014hardware, models and cloud capacity\u2014under preferential financing and shared\u2011security arrangements.  \n\nThe plan\u2019s coherence lies in its sequencing: deregulation clears the runway for capital deployment; infrastructure subsidies ensure that domestic build\u2011outs happen quickly; and diplomatic measures aim simultaneously to starve competitors of hardware and recruit friendly nations into a U.S.\u2011centric ecosystem.  By design, every downstream actor\u2014from hyperscale cloud operators to national research institutes\u2014must now decide whether to align, hedge or decouple.  For Singapore, the timing is pivotal: decisions taken over the next two to three years will lock in supply\u2011chain positions difficult to reverse later in the decade.  \n\n#### 5.2\u202fOpportunities for Alignment  \n\nThe most immediate opening is in **overflow compute**.  Even with accelerated domestic permitting, the United States faces near\u2011term grid constraints in its traditional data\u2011centre hubs; credible forecasts by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation project multi\u2011gigawatt shortfalls through 2028.  The Action\u202fPlan therefore instructs the Departments of Commerce and Energy to secure \u201ctrusted offshore capacity\u201d for allied workloads that can tolerate latency.  Singapore\u2019s forthcoming 300\u202fMW of new, energy\u2011efficient data\u2011centre headroom offers precisely such relief, provided that robust end\u2011use controls satisfy U.S. re\u2011export rules.  \n\nSecond, the Plan\u2019s relative under\u2011investment in **model evaluation and red\u2011teaming** creates room for partners that specialise in safety assurance.  Singapore\u2019s AI\u202fVerify framework, which already maps to NIST and ISO standards, could evolve into the de\u202ffacto validation stop for U.S. open\u2011weight models destined for Asia.  Accepting this role would knit Singapore into the compliance fabric of the emerging American ecosystem while amplifying the Republic\u2019s normative influence.  \n\nThird, the CHIPS\u2011plus incentives embedded in pillar\u202fII focus overwhelmingly on front\u2011end wafer fabrication, leaving a gap in **advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration**\u2014an area where Singapore already commands deep expertise.  By positioning the planned \u201cChiplet Park\u201d as a zero\u2011tariff, export\u2011compliant finishing line for U.S.\u2011fabricated dies, Singapore can anchor a critical node that Washington explicitly wishes to keep outside China yet within easy reach of Asian electronics supply chains.  \n\nFinally, the Plan\u2019s call for **full\u2011stack diplomacy** dovetails with Singapore\u2019s longstanding position as ASEAN\u2019s digital\u2011economy gateway.  If Singapore secures early access to bundled U.S. chips\u2011plus\u2011models, it can serve as a regional distribution and support hub, deepening local ecosystems while reinforcing its reputation for neutrality: the Republic would not choose sides so much as facilitate governed interoperability among them.  \n\n#### 5.3\u202fRisks and Exposure  \n\nAlignment, however, is not a cost\u2011free exercise.  The most acute concern is the **extraterritorial nature of U.S. export controls**.  Under the foreign\u2011direct\u2011product rule extensions, any facility that processes sensitive U.S. technology may itself become subject to licence requirements, creating a compliance moat around Singapore\u2019s future GPU clusters.  A single infraction\u2014whether by a tenant or a subcontractor\u2014could jeopardise hardware supplies and tarnish the island\u2019s reliability brand.  \n\nA second vulnerability arises from **energy price and availability**.  The Action\u202fPlan\u2019s domestic subsidies for grid modernisation may displace U.S. demand for imported LNG, indirectly tightening global gas markets on which Singapore still depends.  Higher fuel prices would erode the cost competitiveness of local data\u2011centres just as new capacity comes online.  Unless long\u2011term power\u2011purchase agreements for low\u2011carbon imports or small modular reactors mature on schedule, supply insecurity could negate the overflow\u2011compute advantage.  \n\nThird, deeper integration with U.S. supply chains may invite **geopolitical pushback from China**, both commercially\u2014through tightened technology transfer to Singapore\u2011based joint ventures\u2014and diplomatically, where Beijing may perceive the Republic\u2019s role as less balanced.  Managing that perception without compromising strategic cooperation with Washington will require calibrated signalling and transparent safety collaborations in which Chinese researchers can participate.  \n\nFinally, there is **talent competition**.  The Action\u202fPlan\u2019s federal apprenticeship and visa accelerators expand the magnetism of U.S. employers precisely in the fields\u2014AI research and semiconductor engineering\u2014that Singapore seeks to scale.  Absent aggressive local incentives, the Republic risks training talent that ultimately migrates to subsidised opportunities in Texas, Arizona or New York.  \n\n#### 5.4\u202fNet Assessment  \n\nOn balance, the Action\u202fPlan amplifies both the upside and downside of Singapore\u2019s existing trajectory.  The upside is substantial: the Republic can become indispensable to Washington\u2019s strategy by offering secure compute spill\u2011over, a turnkey safety\u2011assurance regime and an advanced\u2011packaging bridge that de\u2011risks the U.S.\u2013China tech bifurcation.  The downside is similarly pronounced: heightened exposure to export\u2011control liabilities, energy price volatility and a sharper talent tug\u2011of\u2011war.

The years to 2030 represent a narrow but decisive window during which national assets\u2014capital, regulatory agility, diplomatic credibility\u2014must be marshalled toward four mutually reinforcing ends: indispensability, talent depth, hub status and frontier leadership.  These objectives derive directly from the opportunities and risks mapped in the preceding chapters and they carry explicit, time\u2011bound expectations that should guide subsequent programme design, resource allocation and policy coordination.\n\n#### 6.1\u202fBecoming Indispensable in the AI Race  \n\nIndispensability is achieved when the marginal cost of excluding Singapore from any major AI endeavour outweighs the cost of inclusion for every principal actor.  The Republic can reach that threshold by anchoring functions that neither the United States nor China can perform alone at scale or speed.  Overflow compute\u2014secured through a sovereign GPU reserve powered by low\u2011carbon imports and next\u2011generation nuclear\u2014provides the first pillar.  The second lies in a trusted model\u2011assurance regime, in which AI\u202fVerify and a purpose\u2011built red\u2011team centre standardise safety validation for frontier systems before they enter ASEAN and Commonwealth markets.  Finally, by positioning its advanced\u2011packaging cluster as the finishing line for U.S.\u2011fabricated dies and the launch pad for Asia\u2011bound accelerators, Singapore inserts itself into the most delicate chokepoint between lithography and deployment.  When these three functions converge, partners will find disengagement prohibitively costly, turning Singapore into a structural constant of the AI supply chain rather than a convenient option.  \n\n#### 6.2\u202fDeepening and Diversifying the Talent Pool  \n\nThe transformation envisaged for infrastructure and governance is futile without commensurate human capital.  The headline metric\u2014tripling the resident AI workforce to 15,000 specialists\u2014must evolve from a numeric target into a qualitative agenda.  By 2030, Singapore should host a stratified talent pyramid: a critical mass of frontier researchers capable of building or auditing trillion\u2011parameter models; a mid\u2011level cadre of applied scientists and software engineers who can translate breakthroughs into production systems; and a broad base of technicians\u2014fab operators, power\u2011systems managers, data\u2011centre engineers\u2014whose collective proficiency keeps the physical plant humming.  \n\nAchieving this distribution requires a multipronged approach.  A visa regime that recognises the rarity of senior AI researchers must coexist with an upgraded apprenticeship system that turns local polytechnic and ITE graduates into competent model\u2011ops engineers within eighteen months.  Cross\u2011border fellowships, attached to U.S. and Japanese fabs receiving CHIPS incentives, will help replenish mid\u2011career engineers with experience in chiplet assembly and photonics integration.  Equally important is retention: stock\u2011option portability, research grant continuity and family integration services will lower the opportunity cost of long\u2011term residence, narrowing the salary and prestige gap vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis Silicon Valley.  \n\n#### 6.3\u202fEstablishing a Globally Recognised AI Hub  \n\nHub status is already latent in Singapore\u2019s submarine\u2011cable density, linguistic cosmopolitanism and financial depth, but it must be deliberately recast for the age of foundation models.  By 2028, global AI conferences should regularly alternate between Vancouver, Dubai and Singapore, with the Republic hosting at least one top\u2011tier scholarly gathering\u2014ICLR, NeurIPS or ACL\u2014every year.  More substantively, research institutes and start\u2011ups should treat Singapore not just as a go\u2011to\u2011market station but as a legitimate place to run multi\u2011billion\u2011parameter training jobs, thanks to proximity to the GPU reserve and to a carbon accounting framework recognisable in New\u202fYork, Brussels and Shenzhen alike.  Deep capital pools, anchored by Temasek but diversified through venture funds and sovereign wealth co\u2011investment from Gulf partners, will further entrench the city\u2011state as the venue where ambitious AI start\u2011ups raise late\u2011stage funding without relocating overseas.  \n\nRegulatory coherence undergirds hub attractiveness.  The Personal Data Protection Commission\u2019s sandboxes for privacy\u2011enhancing technologies and synthetic\u2011data generators must mature into a predictable licensing pathway that balances European\u2011style duty\u2011of\u2011care with the U.S. bias toward deregulatory speed.  When start\u2011ups realise they can meet both regimes\u2019 requirements through a single process in Singapore, the country\u2019s gravitational pull strengthens.  \n\n#### 6.4\u202fLeading in Frontier Innovation and Safety  \n\nLeadership does not require outspending the superpowers on raw R&D, but it does demand selective excellence in areas where Singapore\u2019s constraints align with global needs.  One such area is advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration: by pioneering chiplet and photonics modules that deliver higher computational density per watt, Singapore can set standards for the post\u2011Moore epoch.  Another is AI safety science.  The island\u2019s neutrality, coupled with the Singapore Consensus on research priorities, creates a platform where U.S., Chinese and European academics can experiment with evaluation protocols and threat models that might be politically infeasible elsewhere.  If these protocols then feed back into ISO or NIST standards, Singapore will have shaped the rules of the game.  \n\nThe final frontier domain is energy innovation.  To supply reliable low\u2011carbon power without territorial sprawl, Singapore must bring at least one small modular reactor online, integrate floating solar with advanced battery storage and operationalise cross\u2011border power exchanges with Sarawak and the Indonesia\u2011Malaysia Growth Triangle.  Demonstrating that cutting\u2011edge AI clusters can coexist with stringent carbon targets will become a case study for dense urban economies worldwide, reinforcing Singapore\u2019s thought\u2011leadership credentials.  \n\n#### 6.5\u202fInterdependence of Objectives  \n\nThese objectives are intentionally intertwined.  A GPU reserve draws talent and anchors hub status; a red\u2011team centre enriches safety leadership and, through its evaluation outputs, reinforces the indispensability of Singapore\u2019s compliance process.  Conversely, failure in any one objective cascades: a talent shortfall will starve the packaging initiative of engineers; delayed low\u2011carbon power will undercut hub viability and GPU attractiveness.  Holistic governance and synchronised timelines therefore become non\u2011negotiable design constraints for the programmes described in the next chapter.  \n\nThe subsequent section translates these high\u2011level objectives into concrete initiatives, delineating governance structures, resource commitments and performance milestones that can convert promise into measurable progress by 2030."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"wfr_01983aa8a25f76a78549cebae200f61c","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3-pro","default_model_slug":"o3-pro","parent_id":"14bc6d8c-bb05-4403-a038-b93829d30540","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"14bc6d8c-bb05-4403-a038-b93829d30540","children":["6eabbd4a-e45f-4d9c-938d-beeb50b6275c"]},"6eabbd4a-e45f-4d9c-938d-beeb50b6275c":{"id":"6eabbd4a-e45f-4d9c-938d-beeb50b6275c","message":{"id":"6eabbd4a-e45f-4d9c-938d-beeb50b6275c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753331907.238,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Write Chapter 7: Strategic Initiatives and Programmes of your Proposed Report Outline, based on the proposed action plan for the Singapore Government and related analysis.

their presence satisfies U.S. export\u2011control obligations and reassures Washington that no embargo\u2011ed entity can obtain time on the machines.  \n\nImportantly, the GPU Bank is not just excess capacity; it is the gravitational centre for an ecosystem.\u202fIt creates local demand for skilled data\u2011centre technicians and power\u2011systems engineers, underwrites the business model of the Trusted Model Exchange, and draws conferences and venture capital into its orbit.\u202fAn inaugural tranche of 10,000 GPUs should be operational by the first quarter of\u202f2027, when U.S. grid bottlenecks are forecast to peak, giving Singapore first\u2011mover advantage.  \n\n#### 7.2\u202fTrusted Model Exchange (TMX)  \n\nOverflow compute solves only half of the supply problem.\u202fThe other half is trust.\u202fThe TMX will function as a regulatory\u2011technology bourse where developers submit foundation models for a **single\u2011stop validation process** that blends Singapore\u2019s AI\u202fVerify test suite with bespoke adversarial audits carried out by independent red\u2011teamers.\u202fCertification will attest to safety benchmarks compatible with the NIST AI\u202fRMF and the EU AI Act, yet remain light enough to meet the deregulatory spirit of the U.S. Action Plan.\u202fModels passing the TMX pipeline receive a digitally signed provenance token that importing jurisdictions can verify on\u2011chain, lowering the transaction cost of cross\u2011border deployments.  \n\nLinkage to government procurement is decisive.\u202fFrom 2028 onward, any AI system purchased with public funds should possess a TMX certificate.\u202fThat requirement turns compliance from a voluntary badge into a market access prerequisite, incentivising even purely commercial developers to certify in Singapore.  \n\n#### 7.3\u202fAI Safety Red\u2011Team Centre of Excellence  \n\nTo keep the TMX pipeline credible, Singapore will co\u2011found an AI Safety Red\u2011Team Centre with the U.S. AI Safety Institute.\u202fThe Centre will embed 150 rotating fellows each year\u2014drawn from academia, industry and civil society\u2014who conduct structured penetration testing on candidate models.\u202fTheir findings feed back into AI\u202fVerify benchmarks and are published under a controlled\u2011disclosure protocol that balances transparency with security.\u202fA clear intellectual\u2011property regime ensures that vulnerabilities reported through the Centre are jointly owned, giving Singapore the right to update its public\u2011sector systems without waiting for vendor patches.  \n\nBeyond technical value, the Centre deepens diplomatic capital.\u202fBy hosting Chinese, European and Indian researchers alongside American counterparts, Singapore occupies a convening niche unavailable to capitals more entangled in super\u2011power rivalry, reinforcing the Republic\u2019s neutrality credentials.  \n\n#### 7.4\u202fAdvanced\u2011Packaging \u201cChiplet Park\u201d  \n\nThe physical counterpart to computational sovereignty is hardware manufacturing.\u202fJurong Island will host a *Chiplet Industrial Park* dedicated to 2.5\u2011D/3\u2011D advanced packaging, photonics integration and heterogeneous memory stacks.\u202fJTC will supply modular clean\u2011room shells; the Economic Development Board will match private investment with tax credits weighted to technology transfer commitments; and A*STAR institutes will anchor an applied\u2011research spine.  \n\nChiplet Park capitalises on two asymmetric advantages: first, mature\u2011node wafers can be shipped tariff\u2011free under existing U.S.\u2013Singapore agreements; second, no other Southeast\u2011Asian location currently offers the combination of political stability, IP enforcement and skilled labour necessary for sensitive post\u2011processing.\u202fIf the park packages even five percent of U.S. AI\u2011class dies by 2030, Singapore becomes the indispensable bridge between Western fabs and Asian device assemblers.  \n\n#### 7.5\u202fEnergy and Sustainability Measures  \n\nAll digital ambition collapses without electrons.\u202fSingapore therefore pairs the GPU Bank with an *Energy Innovation Suite* comprising (i) a 200\u2011MW floating\u2011solar array on the Southern Islands, (ii) 600\u2011MW of imported hydro\u2011electricity via a high\u2011voltage DC link from Sarawak, and (iii) a 300\u2011MW small modular reactor slated for pilot operation in\u202f2029.\u202fTogether these sources diversify the fuel mix, shave peak gas demand and demonstrate that dense urban economies can power AI workloads without exceeding their carbon budget.\ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n\n#### 7.6\u202fTalent Development Tracks  \n\nSupply\u2011side hardware and energy need demand\u2011side brains.\u202fThe **Tech\u2011Pass\u2011AI** visa will offer five\u2011year renewable residence to senior AI scientists who commit to mentoring local teams or teaching at a partner university for at least 40\u202fhours per year.\u202fIn parallel, the AI Apprenticeship Programme expands to 1,500 participants annually, each cohort spending three months in U.S. or Japanese fabs under a *Talent Bridge* fellowship before returning to local employers.\u202fThe Ministry of Education adjusts polytechnic curricula to add a micro\u2011credential in \u201cModel Operations and Data\u2011Centre Engineering,\u201d building the technician base that hyperscale facilities require.  \n\nRetention completes the loop: stock\u2011option gains realised in Singapore remain tax\u2011free if reinvested in local start\u2011ups, encouraging seasoned engineers to seed the next generation rather than exit to Silicon Valley.  \n\n#### 7.7\u202fEcosystem Infrastructure and Branding  \n\nPhysical and human capital need narrative capital.\u202fSingapore will sponsor a *Regional Compute Interconnect*\u2014a new subsea cable triangulating Singapore, Okinawa and Los\u202fAngeles, optimised for AI traffic\u2014and inaugurate an annual *Singapore Frontier\u202fAI Week* that alternates calendar slots with NeurIPS and ICLR.\u202fThe event will weave academic tracks, regulatory round\u2011tables and venture markets into a single platform, reinforcing the island\u2019s reputation as the place where ideas, policy and capital meet.  \n\n#### 7.8\u202fSynergistic Dynamics  \n\nThese initiatives are designed as a closed\u2011loop system.\u202fThe GPU Bank creates demand for energy innovation, which in turn de\u2011risk data\u2011centre expansion.\u202fChiplet Park\u2019s success feeds into the Bank\u2019s upgrade cycle, securing preferential pricing for next\u2011generation accelerators.\u202fTMX and the Red\u2011Team Centre supply assurance services that raise the premium tenants are willing to pay for compute leases, while conference branding and visa\u2011enabled talent deepen the intellectual pool that feeds research and venture capital.\u202fFailure or delay in any node damps the overall fly\u2011wheel;

Chapter\u202f8 \u2013 Implementation Framework  \n\nA coherent strategy lives or dies in execution.\u202fSingapore\u2019s AI ambitions engage portfolios as varied as finance, defence, manpower, energy, trade and foreign affairs, so any governance architecture must combine decisive central oversight with enough operational autonomy to keep projects agile.\u202fThis chapter describes how the Government will translate the initiatives laid out previously into working institutions, synchronized timelines and predictable funding streams, while embedding the legal authorities required for seamless delivery.  \n\n#### 8.1\u202fWhole\u2011of\u2011Government Governance Structure  \n\nAt the apex stands the **AI\u202fCompetitiveness Council (ACC)**, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and comprising the ministers for Finance, Trade and Industry, Communications and Information, Manpower and Sustainability, together with the heads of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Economic Development Board and the Energy Market Authority.\u202fThe ACC\u2019s mandate is strategic: it approves annual budget envelopes, adjudicates inter\u2011agency conflicts and owns the programme\u2011level key\u2011performance indicators endorsed by Cabinet.  \n\nExecution responsibility cascades to four thematic steering committees: Compute and Infrastructure, Safety and Standards, Semiconductor Value Chain and Talent and Ecosystem Development.\u202fEach is co\u2011chaired by a permanent secretary and a private\u2011sector lead\u2014typically the Singapore CEO of a global technology firm or semiconductor foundry\u2014thereby hard\u2011wiring industry feedback into policy iteration.\u202fSecretariat support is provided by a new Programme Office within the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, staffed with analysts seconded from participating agencies and supplemented by short\u2011term specialists in energy markets, export controls and capital\u2011investment modelling.  \n\nOversight does not return to Cabinet only at budget time.\u202fThe ACC submits quarterly dashboards capturing financial burn\u2011rate, milestone completion, risk\u2011flag indicators and talent inflow statistics.\u202fA mid\u2011term review in 2027 triggers an external audit by the Auditor\u2011General\u2019s Office, benchmarking progress against peer innovation hubs and recommending course corrections before capital commitments peak.  \n\n#### 8.2\u202fPhased Timeline and Milestones  \n\nImplementation unfolds in four overlapping phases.\u202f**Phase\u202f0\u2014Mobilisation (Q4\u202f2025 to Q2\u202f2026)** finalises land\u2011use approvals for the Green\u2011Zone data\u2011centre cluster, issues the inaugural GPU procurement tender and enacts the enabling regulations for the Trusted Model Exchange.\u202f**Phase\u202f1\u2014Foundation Build\u2011out (2026\u20112027)** brings the first 10,000 GPUs online, launches the AI Safety Red\u2011Team Centre\u2019s initial fellowship cohort and breaks ground on Chiplet Park.\u202fConcurrently, power\u2011purchase agreements for imported hydroelectricity reach financial close, and Engineering, Procurement and Construction contracts for a small modular reactor proceed through siting review.  \n\n**Phase\u202f2\u2014Scaling (2028\u20112029)** ramps GPU capacity to 25,000 units, commissions the 200\u2011MW floating\u2011solar array and completes the first production\u2011scale chiplet packaging line.\u202fBy the end of 2029, at least twenty foundation models are expected to have passed the TMX pipeline, half of them destined for cross\u2011border deployments in ASEAN.\u202f**Phase\u202f3\u2014Consolidation (2030)** targets full operational status: 40,000 GPUs in service, the SMR connected to the grid, annual TMX throughput exceeding one hundred models, and Singapore Frontier\u202fAI Week drawing more than 15,000 delegates.\u202fOnly upon achieving these thresholds will the ACC undertake a strategic refresh for the post\u20112030 horizon.  \n\n#### 8.3\u202fFunding and Resource Allocation  \n\nA blended financing model balances sovereign control with market discipline.\u202fSeed equity for the GPU Bank\u2014approximately S$3\u202fbillion\u2014will come from a one\u2011off draw on the Temasek Innovation Fund, matched by a syndicated debt facility underwritten by local banks and multilateral lenders such as the Asian Development Bank.\u202fChiplet Park relies on a *25\u201130\u201140* capital stack: 25\u202fpercent infrastructure grants from the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 envelope, 30\u202fpercent private equity and 40\u202fpercent corporate debt secured against long\u2011term offtake agreements with U.S. fabs.  \n\nOperating costs for the AI Safety Red\u2011Team Centre and TMX certification pipeline fall under a dedicated line item in the Communications and Information budget, offset by certification fees and an earmarked levy on GPU Bank tenancy contracts.\u202fEnergy\u2011project financing uses a build\u2011own\u2011operate concession model; the Government guarantees baseload purchases for the first decade to de\u2011risk investor exposure but retains a revenue\u2011sharing clause once tariff parity with natural gas is achieved.  \n\nFiscal prudence is preserved through sunset clauses: each initiative undergoes a zero\u2011based budgeting review every three years, forcing proponents to justify continued expenditure in light of measurable returns such as export revenue, patent output, employment multipliers and carbon\u2011intensity reduction.  \n\n#### 8.4\u202fLegislative and Regulatory Enablers  \n\nSeveral statutes require amendment.\u202fThe **Strategic Goods (Control) Act** will gain a new Part\u202fVA establishing a licensing fast lane for \u201cTrusted Compute Zones,\u201d streamlining import permits for controlled GPUs while embedding U.S.\u2011aligned end\u2011use conditions in domestic law.\u202fThe **Energy Market Authority Act** will include a dedicated provision for small modular reactors, setting out siting, security and decommissioning obligations to satisfy both local safety standards and international safeguards.  \n\nOn the human\u2011capital side, the **Employment Pass Regulations** will incorporate the Tech\u2011Pass\u2011AI category, exempting holders from sectoral quotas and granting dependent\u2011pass privileges that match those of professionals in finance and biomedical research.\u202fTax legislation will introduce a *super\u2011deduction* for R&D linked to heterogeneous integration, effective until the end of assessment year 2031.  \n\nRegulatory sandboxes also mature: the Personal Data Protection Commission will shift its privacy\u2011enhancing\u2011technology sandbox from an opt\u2011in pilot to a formal licensing pathway, granting international companies legal certainty that systems deployed in Singapore meet both EU and U.S. data\u2011protection thresholds.  \n\n#### 8.5\u202fPublic Accountability and Stakeholder Engagement  \n\nTransparency is a strategic asset in attracting foreign compute tenants, investors and talent.\u202fAccordingly, the ACC will publish an *AI Competitiveness Annual Report* detailing carbon utilisation metrics, TMX certification statistics, semiconductor output volumes and talent inflow figures.\u202fData underlying the report will be released as open datasets, minus commercially sensitive elements, enabling external researchers to perform independent analyses of Singapore\u2019s AI ecosystem performance.  \n\nPublic consultation exercises accompany major milestones: environmental impact assessments for the SMR bid, ethics reviews of GPU Bank governance, and biennial forums on AI safety co\u2011hosted with civil\u2011society groups.\u202fSuch engagement broadens political legitimacy and surfaces potential stumbling blocks early, reducing the risk of litigation\u2011induced delays.  \n\n#### 8.6\u202fSynchronisation with International Partners  \n\nBecause many programme elements hinge on cooperative export\u2011control arrangements and shared safety protocols, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will convene a *Strategic Technology Dialogue* with the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Energy every six months.\u202fA parallel track with the European Commission\u2019s Directorate\u2011General for Communications Networks ensures that TMX certification continues to enjoy EU mutual\u2011recognition, protecting market access for Singapore\u2011validated models even as Brussels tightens AI liability rules.  \n\nActive diplomacy extends to energy: an inter\u2011governmental agreement with Malaysia and Indonesia will establish dispute\u2011resolution mechanisms for cross\u2011border power exchanges, insulating the hydro\u2011import pipeline from political shocks.  \n\n#### 8.7\u202fConclusion and Transition  \n\nThe implementation framework transforms strategic vision into a disciplined project portfolio governed by transparent metrics, diversified funding and explicit legal authority.\u202fIt balances central command with operational flexibility, ensures fiscal responsibility through sunset reviews, and embeds stakeholder engagement as a risk\u2011mitigation tool rather than a compliance afterthought.  \n\nYet a plan, however well structured, operates in a world of uncertainties\u2014market, technological, geopolitical and environmental.\u202fChapter\u202f9 therefore interrogates the downside: what could go wrong, how likely those risks are to materialise, and what contingency mechanisms must be in place to keep Singapore\u2019s AI trajectory on course even under stress."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"

Chapter\u202f9 \u2013 Risk Analysis and Mitigation  \n\nA programme of the breadth outlined in this report carries exposures that, if unmanaged, could erode national advantage or even reverse hard\u2011won gains.\u202fIn keeping with Singapore\u2019s tradition of anticipatory governance, the following analysis treats risk not simply as a list of undesirable events but as an integral variable to be priced, monitored and hedged throughout the life of each initiative.\u202fFive thematic risk clusters stand out: geostrategic and export\u2011control shock, energy and environmental constraints, human\u2011capital pressures, financial and execution slippage, and societal trust and legitimacy.  \n\n#### 9.1\u202fGeostrategic and Export\u2011Control Shock  \n\nThe cornerstone advantages of the strategy\u2014overflow compute and advanced\u2011packaging services\u2014depend on continued access to top\u2011end U.S. hardware and design IP.\u202fWashington\u2019s foreign\u2011direct\u2011product rules already give the Bureau of Industry and Security wide latitude to broaden license requirements without notice.\u202fA sudden tightening that placed Singapore in a more restrictive tier, or that redefined \u201ctrusted end\u2011use,\u201d would disrupt GPU shipments and could strand sunk capital in the GPU Bank.\u202fParallel pressure might come from Beijing: China could, for instance, limit the supply of critical rare\u2011earth magnets or advanced ceramic substrates required for chiplet assembly, using economic leverage to punish perceived alignment with U.S. interests.  \n\nMitigation rests on two tracks.\u202fFirst, build legal and technical redundancy into compliance: end\u2011use monitoring systems should be co\u2011designed with U.S. officials, producing audit trails sufficient to pre\u2011clear future tightening.\u202fSecond, diversify supplier relationships for non\u2011U.S. inputs\u2014rare\u2011earth processing in Australia, high\u2011purity silicon carbide from Japan\u2014so that retaliatory embargoes carry less sting.\u202fIn extremis, a memorandum of understanding with U.S. Defense Production Act authorities could guarantee minimum GPU allocations in exchange for overflow compute access during stateside emergencies, hard\u2011coding Singapore\u2019s indispensability into American contingency plans.  \n\n#### 9.2\u202fEnergy and Environmental Constraints  \n\nThe GPU Bank\u2019s appetite for electricity, coupled with a national decarbonisation roadmap, creates a delicate balancing act.\u202fForecast modelling by the Energy Market Authority suggests that, absent new baseload imports or nuclear generation, reserve margins could fall below the 30\u202fpercent threshold that keeps system\u2011wide reliability above Loss\u2011of\u2011Load Expectation standards by 2028.\u202fSimultaneously, more variable renewable energy raises grid\u2011stability challenges; large training runs can exacerbate frequency deviations if draw is not modulated.  \n\nRisk mitigation integrates supply, demand and grid intelligence.\u202fOn the supply side, power\u2011purchase agreements for Sarawak hydro include force\u2011majeure clauses that trigger liquefied natural\u2011gas backup but at capped spot\u2011price premiums, stabilising cost exposure.\u202fThe first small modular reactor is budgeted with a 15\u202fpercent contingency reserve and a project\u2011delay insurance wrapper underwritten by multilateral development banks.\u202fOn the demand side, the GPU Bank\u2019s scheduler will interleave non\u2011urgent workloads with periods of low system demand, flattening load curves and allowing curtailment of gas turbines during renewables surges.\u202fAn industry\u2011government task force will review carbon\u2011intensity metrics quarterly, with authority to halt incremental GPU procurement if the power system strays from its emissions trajectory.  \n\n#### 9.3\u202fHuman\u2011Capital Pressures  \n\nGlobal competition for frontier researchers and specialist technicians threatens both recruitment and retention.\u202fThe United States and the United Kingdom have streamlined AI\u2011specific visas, while China\u2019s Thousand Talents 2.0 initiative now offers tax\u2011free relocation bonuses paid in digital yuan.\u202fIf Singapore becomes a mere training ground, the local ecosystem will hollow out, and investment commitments that hinge on a skilled workforce could evaporate.  \n\nMitigation has three pillars.\u202fFirst, the Tech\u2011Pass\u2011AI scheme embeds service\u2011obligations\u2014teaching hours, mentoring, IP licensing\u2014that tie immigration privileges to ecosystem spill\u2011overs.\u202fSecond, structured career ladders and wage progression for technicians, benchmarked against oil\u2011and\u2011gas engineering roles, elevate vocational tracks that are currently undervalued.\u202fThird, equity participation incentives\u2014stock\u2011option portability and partial capital\u2011gains tax exemptions\u2014encourage long\u2011term wealth creation within Singapore, reducing churn to foreign employers.\u202fAn early\u2011warning metric, hiring\u2011pipeline velocity, will be tracked monthly; sharp declines trigger salary\u2011support top\u2011ups or accelerated overseas recruitment drives.  \n\n#### 9.4\u202fFinancial and Execution Slippage  \n\nProgrammes of this magnitude can succumb to classic mega\u2011project pitfalls: cost over\u2011runs, construction delays and scope creep.\u202fThe SMR pilot, already novel in its regulatory pathway, carries technology\u2011maturity uncertainty; the GPU Bank, if demand forecasts prove rosy, might face under\u2011utilisation risk that jeopardises debt covenants.\u202fCapital\u2011market volatility could also raise borrowing costs exactly when large tranches of financing are due.  \n\nSingapore\u2019s remedy is phased gating with independent verification at each stage.\u202fFor physical infrastructure, milestone payments hinge on completion certificates issued by an external engineer rather than the project sponsor.\u202fDebt exposures feature floating\u2011to\u2011fixed swap lines triggered automatically if benchmark interest rates breach predefined corridors.\u202fOn the revenue side, the GPU Bank will seed utilisation with anchor tenancy agreements backed by government departments\u2014defence simulation, healthcare analytics\u2014providing a floor that covers operating costs even in a private\u2011sector downturn.\u202fShould utilisation fall below 60\u202fpercent for three consecutive quarters, a sunset clause allows the Council to pause additional GPU purchases and to repurpose space for high\u2011density edge\u2011compute or secure cloud services.  \n\n#### 9.5\u202fSocietal Trust and Legitimacy  \n\nPublic sentiment towards large\u2011scale AI infrastructure can sour quickly if citizens perceive that benefits accrue mainly to foreign multinationals or if fears about job displacement, energy prices and data privacy intensify.\u202fOpposition to nuclear power, although muted today, may resurface once site\u2011specific environmental impact assessments are published.\u202fFailure to secure broad\u2011based legitimacy would erode political capital and invite populist policy shifts that upset investor confidence.  \n\nTransparent stakeholder engagement is therefore not a public\u2011relations afterthought but a strategic risk hedge.\u202fAnnual AI Competitiveness Reports will break down economic value added, employment creation and carbon metrics in plain language; raw data will be made publicly downloadable to enable third\u2011party scrutiny.\u202fCommunity participation panels for the SMR will begin two years before ground\u2011breaking, giving concerned residents early input on safety protocols.\u202fA retraining guarantee for workers displaced by process automation buttresses social licence: any Singaporean who loses employment because of AI deployment in their firm receives subsidised tuition for a skills\u2011conversion programme aligned with data\u2011centre or semiconductor roles.  \n\n#### 9.6\u202fCompound\u2011Risk Scenarios and Contingency Planning  \n\nThe Council\u2019s risk register treats individual shocks, but systemic stress often arises from cascading interactions.\u202fConsider a plausible 2028 scenario: an unexpected U.S.\u2013China diplomatic rupture precipitates stiffer export controls, which delay GPU deliveries; simultaneously, drought reduces hydro imports, prompting spot\u2011market gas price spikes; a mid\u2011scale cyber incident exploits a vulnerability uncovered by the Red\u2011Team Centre but not yet patched in industry deployments.\u202fCompound stress of this type could choke compute throughput, raise operating costs and erode trust.  \n\nContingency measures are layered.\u202fA strategic GPU reserve of ten percent of installed capacity is held in cold storage for redeployment in crises.\u202fLong\u2011term LNG contracts include volume flex clauses that unlock additional cargoes within forty\u2011five days at predetermined premiums.\u202fThe Cyber Security Agency chairs a rapid\u2011response \u201cPatch Sprint\u201d consortium that can push critical fixes across TMX\u2011certified models within seventy\u2011two hours, leveraging the same audit trail used for export\u2011control compliance.\u202fAn emergency fiscal buffer\u2014up to S$1\u202fbillion\u2014sits within the Contingencies Fund and can be released via presidential warrant to backstop either energy costs or accelerated hardware procurement.  \n\n#### 9.7\u202fDynamic Risk Governance  \n\nRisk, by definition, evolves.\u202fEach steering committee therefore maintains a live dashboard of leading indicators\u2014GPU spot\u2011market prices, grid reserve margins, visa application turnaround times, capital\u2011expenditure variance\u2014feeding directly into the Programme Office\u2019s integrated risk analytics platform.\u202fMachine\u2011learning models flag deviations from baseline forecasts and simulate downstream impacts, giving the ACC lead time to adjust policy levers before shocks crystallise.  \n\nIntegration of risk analytics with performance monitoring provides a segue to the next subject of this report.\u202fWhile the discussion here has focused on identification and mitigation, Chapter\u202f10 turns to the architecture of *measurement*: the key indicators, data pipelines and reporting cadences that will provide Cabinet, Parliament and the public with real\u2011time visibility into whether the strategy is delivering on its promise\u2014and, just as important, whether emerging risks are being tamed before they can threaten national advantage."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"

Chapter\u202f10 \u2013 Monitoring, Evaluation\u202f&\u202fReporting  \n\nEffective execution depends on disciplined measurement.\u202fBecause the initiatives outlined in this report intertwine infrastructure, regulation, diplomacy and human\u2011capital development, their progress cannot be tracked by a single dashboard or annual review.\u202fInstead, Singapore will adopt a tiered performance\u2011management system that marries real\u2011time operational telemetry to periodic strategic evaluations, ensuring that policy course\u2011corrections occur before slippage becomes irreversible.  \n\n#### 10.1\u202fKey Performance Indicators and Data Sources  \n\nThe **AI\u202fCompetitiveness Council (ACC)** has endorsed a core set of metrics, each mapped to a strategic objective and supplied by an authoritative data pipeline.\u202fCompute capacity, for example, is measured not merely in aggregate GPU count but in \u201ceffective petaFLOPS\u201d adjusted for model architecture and utilisation efficiency, captured directly from the GPU Bank\u2019s scheduler logs.\u202fEnergy metrics integrate live import flows from the high\u2011voltage DC interconnect, SMR output once commissioned, and granular carbon\u2011intensity readings supplied by the National Environment Agency.\u202fTalent indicators track visa approvals, local graduate throughput, retention rates and wage bands, blending Ministry of Manpower data with anonymised payroll submissions from accredited employers.\u00a0TMX performance, safety\u2011audit closures and semiconductor output volumes feed into the same repository through secure APIs.  \n\nEvery metric carries a baseline, an annual target and an alert threshold.\u202fIf GPU utilisation, for instance, falls ten percentage points below trajectory for two consecutive months, an automated flag prompts the Compute and Infrastructure Steering Committee to propose remedial action\u2014discounted leasing rates, revised marketing, or deferred hardware procurement\u2014to the ACC.  \n\n#### 10.2\u202fData Governance and Quality Assurance  \n\nTo avoid siloed or inconsistent reporting, all performance data flow into the **National Digital Insights Exchange**\u2014a platform operated by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group that already hosts Whole\u2011of\u2011Government analytics for transport, health and social programmes.\u202fThe platform enforces schema conformity, time\u2011stamp synchronisation and lineage tracking so that every dashboard figure is traceable to its primary source.\u00a0Quarterly audits by the Government Technology Agency\u2019s Data Quality Office validate sampling integrity and detect anomalies such as duplicate entries or latency\u2011induced gaps.\u202fA checksum\u2011based immutability layer prevents retroactive editing, preserving the evidentiary value of the data.  \n\n#### 10.3\u202fReporting Cadence and Audience  \n\nPerformance information is disseminated on three horizons.\u202f*Real\u2011time operational dashboards* are available to authorised officers in the Programme Office and steering committees, supporting day\u2011to\u2011day decision\u2011making.\u202f*Quarterly performance memoranda* synthesise progress, budget absorption and leading\u2011indicator risk signals for ACC review; the memoranda are declassified versions of the dashboards, redacted only for commercially sensitive inputs.\u00a0Finally, an *Annual AI Competitiveness Report*\u2014modeled on the Monetary Authority\u2019s Financial Stability Review\u2014presents headline metrics, narrative analysis and policy adjustments to Cabinet, Parliament and the public.\u202fThe report\u2019s raw datasets are released on the government open\u2011data portal within 48\u202fhours of publication, enabling researchers and industry observers to replicate calculations and propose improvements.  \n\n#### 10.4\u202fMid\u2011Term Review and Adaptive Management  \n\nThe complexity of frontier technologies and the volatility of geopolitical alignments mean that even the best\u2011designed KPIs can become obsolete.\u202fTherefore, a **Mid\u2011Term Review (MTR)** is scheduled for the second half of\u202f2027.\u00a0Conducted by an external consortium led by the Auditor\u2011General\u2019s Office and two international benchmarks institutions\u2014the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation and the World Economic Forum\u2019s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2014the MTR will test the relevance of existing indicators, stress\u2011test scenario assumptions and recommend reallocations of capital or personnel.\u00a0Cabinet is required to respond formally to each recommendation within 90\u202fdays, ensuring that findings translate into policy action rather than archival record.  \n\nAdaptive management extends beyond the MTR.\u202fIf a disruptive technology\u2014such as neuromorphic accelerators or fault\u2011tolerant quantum processors\u2014reaches commercial readiness ahead of schedule, the ACC can invoke a **fast\u2011track amendment clause** to add new KPIs or sunset outdated ones without awaiting the annual cycle.\u00a0Conversely, if external shocks\u2014the imposition of a multilateral carbon border tax, for instance\u2014render certain targets unattainable without disproportionate cost, the Council may propose revised trajectories with transparent justification.  \n\n#### 10.5\u202fAccountability and Incentive Alignment  \n\nTransparency alone does not guarantee behaviour change; incentives must link outcomes to managerial stakes.\u202fChief Executives of statutory boards running the GPU Bank, TMX and Chiplet Park will have 25\u202fpercent of variable remuneration tied to multi\u2011year KPI achievement, adjusted for risk factors outside managerial control to deter excessive risk\u2011taking.\u00a0For civil\u2011service leads, the Public Service Division will incorporate programme performance into the annual performance appraisal framework.\u00a0Private\u2011sector co\u2011chairs of steering committees will sign non\u2011binding Letters of Responsibility acknowledging reputational accountability for delivery milestones, reinforcing partnership norms without imposing statutory liabilities that could deter participation.  \n\n#### 10.6\u202fPublic Engagement as Oversight  \n\nSingapore\u2019s high\u2011trust society affords the Government latitude to pursue ambitious technology projects, but that trust is contingent on responsiveness.\u202fAll reporting instruments described above include a citizen\u2011feedback channel\u2014online consultations, town\u2011hall meetings, and sector\u2011specific dialogues\u2014whose insights feed directly into steering\u2011committee deliberations.\u00a0The GPU Bank\u2019s electricity draw, for example, triggers automatic publication of its hourly carbon footprint, so that environmental groups can cross\u2011reference claims against empirical data in near real time.\u00a0A similar module for the TMX allows researchers to download de\u2011identified audit logs, fostering third\u2011party research on AI safety and bias.  \n\nThese mechanisms turn monitoring from a bureaucratic obligation into a participatory process, strengthening social licence and surfacing blind spots that formal hierarchies might overlook.  \n\n#### 10.7\u202fTransition to Continual Improvement  \n\nThe monitoring architecture described above not only guards against drift; it institutionalises a learning loop that accelerates policy evolution.\u202fMetrics, audits and public feedback supply empirical evidence; the steering committees translate evidence into adjustment proposals; and the ACC, backed by Cabinet authority, closes the loop by approving or rejecting refinements.\u202fThe cycle repeats quarterly, embedding agility into the governance of an otherwise capital\u2011intensive and long\u2011horizon strategy.  \n\nWith measurement and feedback loops firmly in place, the report can now turn to its culminating argument: why sustained commitment to the roadmap outlined here promises not just incremental gains but a durable strategic transformation, and what call to action Cabinet is asked to endorse.\u00a0Chapter\u202f11 distils the overarching narrative, synthesising the case for urgent yet disciplined execution."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"

The United\u202fStates\u2019 2025 *AI Action Plan*\u2014a sweeping package that couples accelerated domestic build\u2011outs with tighter export controls and full\u2011stack technology diplomacy\u2014creates a fleeting opportunity for small, advanced economies that can offer trusted capacity, talent and governance at scale.  Chapters\u202f3 through\u202f10 of this report map that terrain and translate it into a pragmatic pathway for Singapore to become an indispensable node in the international AI value chain by 2030.  \n\n**Key Findings.**  The next half\u2011decade will be dominated by three bottlenecks: advanced chips, low\u2011carbon energy and accredited safety assurance.  Singapore already commands deep strengths in semiconductor back\u2011end production, submarine\u2011cable connectivity and principled AI governance, but faces hard constraints in land, power and senior technical talent.  The U.S. plan both magnifies the upside of those assets\u2014by seeking overflow compute, packaging partners and evaluation regimes\u2014and sharpens risks, particularly export\u2011control exposure and energy security challenges.  \n\n**Priority Recommendations.**  \n\n1. **Establish a Sovereign GPU Bank** of 40\u202f000 high\u2011end processors housed in energy\u2011efficient \u201cgreen\u2011zone\u201d data\u2011centres and governed under a new Trusted Compute Zone licence.  \n2. **Operationalise the Trusted Model Exchange (TMX)** as a single\u2011stop certification pipeline that blends Singapore\u2019s AI\u202fVerify toolkit with adversarial red\u2011team audits conducted in partnership with the U.S. AI Safety Institute.  \n3. **Develop an Advanced\u2011Packaging \u201cChiplet Park\u201d** on Jurong Island to receive U.S.\u2011fabricated dies and integrate them into next\u2011generation accelerators for Asian device assemblers.  \n4. **Secure Low\u2011Carbon Baseload Power** through a tripartite supply stack comprising imported hydroelectricity, a 200\u202fMW floating\u2011solar array and a 300\u202fMW small modular reactor pilot.  \n5. **Deepen the Talent Pyramid** via Tech\u2011Pass\u2011AI visas for senior researchers, an expanded AI Apprenticeship Programme for mid\u2011level practitioners, and vocational micro\u2011credentials in model\u2011ops and data\u2011centre engineering.  \n6. **Institutionalise Whole\u2011of\u2011Government Governance** under an AI\u202fCompetitiveness Council (ACC) that sets targets, allocates budgets and publishes open\u2011data performance dashboards.  \n\n**Implementation Timeline (2025\u20112030).**  \n- **2025\u202fQ4 \u2013 2026\u202fH1:** Land\u2011use approvals for the GPU Bank; enabling legislation for TMX; first Tech\u2011Pass\u2011AI visas issued.  \n- **2026\u202f\u2011\u202f2027:** Ten\u2011thousand GPUs online; Red\u2011Team Centre launches; Chiplet Park ground\u2011breaking; power\u2011purchase agreements for hydro imports reach financial close.  \n- **2028\u202f\u2011\u202f2029:** GPU capacity scales to 25\u202f000 units; floating\u2011solar array commissioned; first production run from Chiplet Park; twenty foundation models certified through TMX.  \n- **2030:** Forty\u2011thousand GPUs in service; SMR connected to grid; TMX throughput crosses one hundred models; Singapore Frontier\u202fAI Week attendance exceeds 15\u202f000; mid\u2011term talent target of 15\u202f000 resident specialists achieved.  \n\nSuccessful delivery of these milestones will lock Singapore into the hardware, software and safety circuits that define twenty\u2011first\u2011century economic and security power, while safeguarding energy resilience and social legitimacy at home.  \n\n---\n\n## Chapter\u202f2 \u2013 Introduction  \n\n### 2.1\u202fPurpose and Scope  \n\nThis report responds to Cabinet\u2019s instruction of 2\u202fJuly\u202f2025 to assess the implications of the United\u202fStates\u2019 *AI Action Plan* for Singapore and to recommend a forward\u2011looking strategy that secures national competitiveness in the global AI economy.  While the Plan is American in origin, its extraterritorial reach\u2014via export controls, standards diplomacy and technology financing\u2014means that Singapore\u2019s room for manoeuvre will be shaped as much by Washington\u2019s rules as by domestic policy choices.  The report therefore examines both external dynamics and internal capabilities, culminating in an integrated roadmap for the period 2025\u20112030.  \n\n### 2.2\u202fMethodology  \n\nThe analysis synthesises four strands of evidence:\n\n* Primary policy texts, notably the U.S. *AI Action Plan*, the EU\u202fAI\u202fAct and China\u2019s generative\u2011AI regulations.  \n* Quantitative data on compute supply, energy demand, talent flows and venture capital drawn from government agencies, industry consortia and multilateral organisations.  \n* Scenario modelling of power\u2011system reliability, export\u2011control tightening and capital\u2011market volatility conducted by the Government Technology Agency and external academic partners.  \n* Stakeholder consultations with semiconductor manufacturers, cloud providers, research institutions, civil\u2011society organisations and foreign regulators.  \n\n### 2.3\u202fDefinitions and Terminology  \n\nFor clarity, \u201coverflow compute\u201d denotes GPU capacity located outside the United\u202fStates but controlled under U.S. export\u2011compliance agreements.  \u201cAdvanced packaging\u201d refers to post\u2011fabrication processes\u20142.5\u2011D interposers, 3\u2011D stacked die, chiplet integration\u2014that raise performance per watt beyond what conventional planar layouts can achieve.  \u201cSafety assurance\u201d encompasses both technical evaluations (red\u2011team testing, bias audits) and process governance (traceability, incident reporting).  \n\n### 2.4\u202fStructure of the Report  \n\nChapters\u202f3 and\u202f4 establish the global AI landscape and Singapore\u2019s current positioning.  Chapter\u202f5 analyses the geostrategic openings and vulnerabilities created by the U.S. plan, while Chapter\u202f6 distils these insights into four strategic objectives.  Chapter\u202f7 translates objectives into concrete programmes, Chapter\u202f8 details the implementation framework and Chapter\u202f9 interrogates risks and mitigation levers.

Chapter\u202f11 \u2013 Conclusion  \n\nSingapore\u2019s economic resilience has always rested on an ability to spot inflection points early and to respond with disciplined, whole\u2011of\u2011nation execution.\u202fThe advent of foundational artificial intelligence, coupled with the United\u202fStates\u2019 decision to weaponise scale, regulation and supply\u2011chain diplomacy through its *AI\u202fAction\u202fPlan*, is precisely such an inflection point.  \n\nThe analysis presented in this report shows that Singapore\u2019s existing assets\u2014deep semiconductor know\u2011how, unrivalled connectivity, principled governance and diplomatic agility\u2014can be recombined into a value proposition that neither the United\u202fStates, China nor the European Union can readily substitute.\u202fBy anchoring overflow compute in a sovereign GPU Bank, embedding itself in the last mile of advanced packaging, and elevating AI\u202fVerify and the Trusted Model Exchange into global safety benchmarks, the Republic makes itself structurally indispensable to every major AI power.\u202fThe payoff is not simply higher GDP.\u202fIt is strategic leverage: assured access to frontier technology, a seat at the table where global norms are set, and an energy architecture that turns climate constraints into competitive edge.  \n\nNone of this is automatic.\u202fThe path outlined here demands S$10\u202fbillion in combined public\u2011private capital, unprecedented regulatory coordination and the import\u2014and retention\u2014of thousands of scarce professionals.\u202fExecution risk is real, as the risk matrix in Chapter\u202f9 makes plain.\u202fYet inaction carries the greater danger: a world in which compute, safety standards and semiconductor value\u2011added bypass Singapore, leaving the nation to compete only on last\u2011mile services.  \n\nThe Cabinet is therefore invited to endorse the programme portfolio, the governance architecture and the performance\u2011management system set out in Chapters\u202f7 through\u202f10.\u202fApproval will authorise the AI\u202fCompetitiveness Council to release the first\u2011year budget envelope, issue enabling regulations for Trusted Compute Zones and Tech\u2011Pass\u2011AI visas, and commence bilateral negotiations with the United\u202fStates on end\u2011use certification and preferential hardware allocations.  \n\nWith decisive backing, Singapore can move from tactical participant to strategic orchestrator of the global AI economy\u2014an evolution entirely in keeping with its history, and essential to its future.  \n\n---\n\n## Appendices  \n\n### Appendix\u202fA \u2013 Comparative Metrics: Global AI Readiness Index  \nA fifty\u2011page statistical annex benchmarking Singapore against

Appendix\u202fG \u2013 Synopsis of the United\u202fStates *AI\u202fAction\u202fPlan* (July\u202f2025)  \n\nThe *America\u2019s\u202fAI\u202fAction\u202fPlan* unveiled by President\u202fTrump in July\u202f2025 is the most far\u2011reaching technology\u2011industrial strategy adopted by Washington since the post\u2011war space race.\u202fIt seeks to entrench \u201cunquestioned and unchallenged\u201d U.S. primacy in artificial intelligence by fusing domestic deregulation, large\u2011scale infrastructure spending and coercive\u2011plus\u2011incentive diplomacy into a single, sequenced programme.  \n\n#### Integrated Strategic Logic  \n\nThe Plan begins from a blunt premise: compute, data and talent are the commanding heights of twenty\u2011first\u2011century power, and whoever controls them writes the rules.\u202fWashington therefore pledges to **expand domestic supply faster than rivals can match,** while using export controls and standards alliances to **slow adversaries and steer partners** toward an American technology stack.\u202fAll downstream measures\u2014tax credits, permitting reforms, model\u2011evaluation pilots\u2014derive from this organising intent.  \n\n#### Pillar\u202fI \u2013 Accelerate Innovation  \n\nFederal agencies are instructed to treat AI as an essential\u2011national\u2011security technology.\u202fWithin ninety days each must withdraw or rewrite regulations deemed to \u201cmaterially impede\u201d model development or deployment; future rules face a mandatory *Innovation Impact Assessment* that quantifies compliance costs in training\u2011run equivalents.\u202fGovernment procurement is recast to favour **open\u2011weight models**\u2014the Plan argues that public funds should not reinforce proprietary \u201cgatekeepers.\u201d\u202fA permanent **R&D super\u2011credit** lets firms deduct 125\u202fpercent of qualified AI expenditures, while an expanded *Talent America* visa accelerates green\u2011card processing for PhD\u2011level AI researchers and semiconductor engineers.  \n\n#### Pillar\u202fII \u2013 Build AI Infrastructure  \n\nRecognising that model scale is bounded by physical constraints, the Plan orders sweeping **permitting fast\u2011tracks**: National Environmental Policy Act reviews for data\u2011centres must conclude in six months; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approvals for grid interconnects drop to one year.\u202fA new **Clean Compute Tax Credit** covers 30\u202fpercent of capital expenditure for facilities powered by sub\u20110.35\u202fkg\u202fCO\u2082/kWh electricity.\u202fParallel legislation revives nuclear energy via small modular reactors, ring\u2011fencing US$10\u202fbillion in loan guarantees.\u202fOn semiconductors, the existing CHIPS Act is tightened: subsidies now favour fabs that pledge *commercial yield by 2027* and accept claw\u2011back clauses if production slips.\u202fExport licences for advanced lithography tools remain contingent on location\u2011verified supply chains to prevent diversion to China.  \n\n#### Pillar\u202fIII \u2013 Lead in International Diplomacy and Security  \n\nDiplomatically, the Plan treats AI as a linchpin of alliance management.\u202fThe Commerce Department will broker **\u201cfull\u2011stack\u201d export packages**\u2014chips, reference models and cloud credits\u2014offered under concessionary financing to countries that adopt U.S. end\u2011use monitoring.\u202fConcurrently, **GPU export controls tighten**: clock\u2011speed and interconnect ceilings fall further, and a real\u2011time end\u2011user verification platform obliges exporters to geo\u2011fence hardware.\u202fOn standards, the United States commits to contest Chinese influence in ISO, ITU and G\u201120 digital\u2011economy fora, and to seed an open catalogue of AI safety benchmarks aligned with NIST.  \n\nSecurity provisions complete the architecture.\u202fA new **AI\u2011ISAC** (Information Sharing and Analysis Centre) shares cyber\u2011threat intelligence among model providers; DoD and the Intelligence Community receive a classified \u201chigh\u2011security cloud\u201d for training sensitive models.\u202fBio\u2011security overlays require DNA\u2011sequence providers to implement AI\u2011screening layers before fulfilling synthesis orders, pre\u2011empting dual\u2011use exploitation.  \n\n#### Governance and Financing  \n\nA White House **Office of the AI Coordinator**\u2014informally, the \u201cAI Czar\u201d\u2014chairs an inter\u2011agency task force with quarterly reporting to Congress.\u202fHeadline budget authority totals **US$45\u202fbillion over five years**, split roughly one\u2011third grant funding, one\u2011third tax expenditures and one\u2011third loan guarantees, with latitude to re\u2011programme in response to supply\u2011chain shocks.  \n\n#### Implications for Partners  \n\nThe Plan\u2019s carrot\u2011and\u2011stick design forces external actors into clear categories: **trusted compute partners** that gain preferential access to hardware and models, or untrusted jurisdictions that face cascading export restrictions.\u202fIt implicitly outsources overflow compute, model evaluation and certain post\u2011fab manufacturing steps to allied territories with credible governance.\u202fAs analysed in Chapters\u202f5 and\u202f6, this dynamic creates a sharp opportunity for Singapore to insert itself\u2014via a sovereign GPU reserve, an advanced\u2011packaging hub and an internationally recognised safety\u2011assurance layer\u2014into the very functions Washington has chosen to externalise.  \n\n#### Transition to Singapore\u2019s Response  \n\nAgainst this backdrop, our national roadmap (Chapters\u202f7\u201310) positions Singapore to capture the overflow, compliance and packaging niches left open by the American strategy, while insulating the Republic from its attendant export\u2011control and energy risks.\u202fThe following

Strategic Rationale  \n\nThe Plan frames AI as a critical\u2011infrastructure domain on par with energy and defence, arguing that superiority in large\u2011scale model training, semiconductor design and data\u2011centre capacity will confer decisive economic and military advantages.\u202fIt highlights three systemic bottlenecks\u2014compute, energy and specialised talent\u2014and treats them as arenas of interstate competition.\u202fChina is named explicitly as the principal competitor; allied nations are invited to \u201cplug into\u201d a U.S.\u2011centric stack on preferential terms, but only if they align with new export\u2011control and security protocols.  \n\n---\n\n#### 2. Three Pillars and Flagship Measures  \n\n| Pillar | Core Instruments | Illustrative Flagship Measures |\n|--------|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| **I.\u202fAccelerate Innovation** | Deregulation, open\u2011source incentives, tax credits | \u2022 \u201cInnovation Impact Statements\u201d required before any new federal rule affecting AI.<br>\u2022 Mandate that federal procurement weight models\u2019 adherence to open\u2011weight licensing.<br>\u2022 45\u202fpercent R&D super\u2011deduction for AI start\u2011ups below US$500\u202fmillion revenue. |\n| **II.\u202fBuild AI Infrastructure** | Fast\u2011track permits, energy subsidies, CHIPS\u2011plus incentives | \u2022 National \u201cBuild\u2011Baby\u2011Build\u201d directive sets 12\u2011month deadline on data\u2011centre and transmission approvals.<br>\u2022 US$40\u202fbillion in additional 30\u202fpercent investment tax credits for nuclear, geothermal and grid\u2011scale storage tied to AI loads.<br>\u2022 New \u201cFab Express Lane\u201d cuts average advanced\u2011node factory permitting time from 18 to 9\u202fmonths. |\n| **III.\u202fLead in International AI Diplomacy & Security** | Export controls, alliance packages, safety standards | \u2022 Extension of the Foreign\u2011Direct\u2011Product Rule to any AI accelerators >4,800\u202fTOPS.<br>\u2022 Location\u2011verified GPU requirement: chips report telemetry to U.S. cloud\u2011based registers.<br>\u2022 \u201cFull\u2011stack AI\u201d export bundles\u2014chips, models, cloud credits\u2014offered to allies that accept end\u2011use audits.<br>\u2022 Launch of an AI\u2011ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Centre) for cross\u2011border incident response. |\n\n*Implementation Horizon.*  The Plan sets an aggressive cadence: major tax and permitting changes to be enacted within twelve months; first 20\u202fGW of new AI\u2011dedicated generation on\u2011line by 2028; and at least four allied *full\u2011stack* packages delivered annually from 2026 onward.  \n\n---\n\n#### 3. Cross\u2011Cutting Themes  \n\n*Open\u2011Source as Soft Power.*  The Administration argues that freeing model weights\u2014subject to security vetting\u2014undermines competitors\u2019 proprietary moats and accelerates domestic innovation.\u202fIt commits federal funding to maintain reference open models and to litigate against state\u2011level content restrictions deemed \u201cviewpoint discriminatory.\u201d  \n\n*Workforce First.*  Recognising acute shortages in trades such as high\u2011voltage electricians, HVAC technicians and fab operators, the Plan funds 200\u202f000 apprenticeship slots and ties CHIPS\u2011subsidised fabs to local vocational pipelines.  \n\n*Security by Design.*  All federal AI systems must adopt \u201csecure\u2011by\u2011default\u201d architectures validated by penetration testing; the same standards are exported via alliance packages, turning security compliance into an instrument of economic statecraft.  \n\n*Energy Realism.*  The Plan treats grid capacity, not chip counts, as the ultimate scaling constraint.\u202fIt therefore bundles environmental\u2011review shortcuts with incentives for nuclear Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), geothermal wells and long\u2011duration storage\u2014technologies capable of delivering continuous power at petawatt\u2011hour scale.  \n\n---\n\n#### 4. Anticipated Global Ripple Effects  \n\n1. **Export\u2011Control Tightening.**  By extending control to foreign\u2011made goods incorporating U.S. IP, the Plan forces every country to choose between seamless access to cutting\u2011edge GPUs and unrestricted commerce with China.  \n2. **Investment Re\u2011routing.**  CHIPS\u2011plus tax credits, coupled with expedited permits, draw advanced\u2011node fabrication back to U.S. soil; non\u2011U.S. actors will find comparative advantage in packaging, photonics integration and specialised substrates rather than front\u2011end lithography.  \n3. **Standards Competition.**  The U.S. intends its safety\u2011and\u2011security templates to pre\u2011empt stricter, process\u2011heavy EU regulation, thereby shaping global norms in a more deregulatory direction.  \n4. **Power\u2011Market Distortions.**  Subsidies for nuclear and geothermal could dampen U.S. domestic LNG demand, pushing up international gas prices\u2014particularly salient for import\u2011dependent economies like Singapore.  \n\n---\n\n#### 5. Significance for Singapore  \n\n*Window of Opportunity.*  The Plan\u2019s appetite for **overflow compute**, **advanced packaging** and **third\u2011party safety evaluation** aligns precisely with Singapore\u2019s comparative advantages.\u202fStateside data\u2011centre and grid bottlenecks will not clear before 2028; until then, Washington needs secure offshore capacity that can be dialled up quickly.  \n\n*Compliance Imperative.*  Singapore\u2019s access to state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art GPUs will hinge on proving strict end\u2011use control.\u202fHence the proposal for a *Trusted Compute Zone* licence embedded in domestic law.  \n\n*Energy Pressure.*  If U.S. policy squeezes global LNG supply, local power costs could rise unless Singapore accelerates low\u2011carbon imports and SMR deployment\u2014exactly the measures recommended in Chapters\u202f6 and\u202f7.  \n\n*Talent Tug\u2011of\u2011War.*  U.S. visa accelerators risk draining the very experts Singapore seeks to attract; the Tech\u2011Pass\u2011AI scheme and equity\u2011retention incentives are designed to counter that pull.  \n\n---\n\n#### 6. Implications for Policy Endorsement  \n\nThe *AI\u202fAction\u202fPlan* makes clear that passive participation is no longer viable.\u202fJurisdictions that fail to integrate into the emergent U.S.\u2011led ecosystem will face hardware rationing, standards misalignment and diminished influence over AI governance.\u202fConversely, those that move early to supply complementary capabilities\u2014trusted compute, packaging, safety testing\u2014will lock in privileged access and shape rule\u2011making from within.  \n\nThe strategic initiatives presented in this report are therefore not optional enhancements but defensive necessities.\u202fThey provide a calibrated response that leverages Singapore\u2019s existing strengths while insulating the nation from the downside risks that the U.S. plan inevitably introduces.  Endorsement and rapid execution will ensure that Singapore is not merely a spectator but a pivotal stakeholder in the age of limitless compute."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":7139,"end_idx":7139,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"9641f8b48edc601c-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"91b9cf4a-949d-41b1-955a-ea0443629d37","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"91b9cf4a-949d-41b1-955a-ea0443629d37","children":[]}}}
