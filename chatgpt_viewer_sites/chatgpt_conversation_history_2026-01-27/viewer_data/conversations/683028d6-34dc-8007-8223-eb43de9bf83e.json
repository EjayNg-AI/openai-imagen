The current retail-friendly MPI licence-holders with long operating histories are **Coinbase Singapore, Coinhako, Independent Reserve and Crypto.com**.  OKX and Gemini have MAS IPAs and are on track for full licences.  For larger ticket sizes, the **DBS Digital Exchange** (accredited-investor only) offers the strongest bank-grade custody.  Whichever route you pick, use the exchange only as an on-/off-ramp, enable hardware-key 2FA, and move long-term holdings to a self-custody wallet.  Below is a detailed roadmap.\n\n---\n\n## 1  Singapore\u2019s regulatory landscape\nMAS requires any firm offering \u201cdigital-payment-token (DPT) services\u201d to hold an MPI licence under the **Payment Services Act 2019**.  The public directory lists all current licensees and is the first place to check an exchange\u2019s status. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  MAS also publishes repeated consumer advisories stressing that even licensed DPT services are **not** covered by deposit-insurance or investor-protection schemes; you must be able to stomach a 100 % loss. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\n### Why MPI status matters\n* Exchange must segregate customer assets, meet minimum capital and cybersecurity requirements, and submit regular audits to MAS.  \n* MAS can revoke licences or impose directions; Luno\u2019s 2023 exit after withdrawing its application shows MAS will not hesitate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 2  Top regulated on-ramps for retail investors\n\n| Exchange (Year founded) | Licence status | SGD funding & fees* | Security & transparency highlights |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Coinbase Singapore** (2012) | Full MPI (Oct 2023) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 | FAST deposits via StraitsX \u2013 free; trading 0.6 %\u21920.22 % tiered | 90 %+ cold storage; SOC 1 & 2 audits; quarterly proof-of-reserves-style disclosure |\n| **Coinhako** (2014) | Full MPI (May 2022) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 | FAST / PayNow free; maker 0.4 %, taker 0.6 % | On-chain proof-of-reserves, ISO 27001 certified; local helpdesk |\n| **Independent Reserve** (2013) | First exchange to get MPI (Oct 2021) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 | FAST free; trading 0.5 %\u21920.02 % | Big 4-audited annual report; insurance on custody assets; 100 % reserve statement |\n| **Crypto.com** (2016) | Full MPI (Jun 2023) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 | FAST/PayNow free; maker 0.075 %, taker 0.075 % (with CRO stake) | USD 750 mn insurance; real-time Merkle-tree proof-of-reserves |\n| **OKX** (2017) | MAS MPI licence Nov 2024, SGD FAST deposits live \ue200cite\ue202turn0news99\ue201 | FAST free; trading 0.08 % maker/0.10 % taker | PoR attested monthly; multi-sig cold wallets |\n| **Gemini** (2014) | MAS IPA (Nov 2024) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 | FAST via StraitsX; 0.35 % flat | SOC 2 Type II; real-time PoR; New York Trust charter |\n\n\\*Indicative rates as of May 2025; check each platform for current fees.\n\n---\n\n## 3  Institutional / accredited-investor route\n* **DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx)** \u2013 accessible only through DBS Treasures Private Client or Vickers accounts and only if you meet the S$2 million accredited-investor threshold.  Assets are custodied in a segregated trust with DBS Bank, an AA-rated institution. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n* **Anchorage Digital, BitGo Singapore, etc.** appear in the MAS MPI directory for institutional custody only; retail users would still need an exchange to acquire BTC. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4  Security best-practice checklist\n\n1. **Use exchange only for purchase.**  Withdraw to a **hardware wallet** (Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard) you control.  \n2. **Enable U2F / FIDO2 authentication** (e.g., YubiKey) on the exchange account and wallet software.  \n3. **Whitelist withdrawal addresses** and lock the list with a time-delay.  \n4. **Verify proof-of-reserves** statements and circulating audit reports.  \n5. **Keep redundant off-site backups** of seed phrases, ideally split with Shamir-secret-sharing or multi-sig.  \n6. **Test a small withdrawal** before committing large sums.  \n\n---\n\n## 5  Efficient accumulation strategy\n\n### Step-by-step\n1. **Open and verify** an account with one MPI-licensed exchange above.  \n2. **Fund via FAST/PayNow** from a Singapore-bank account or through **StraitsX** to mint XSGD stablecoins for instant transfer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news99\ue201  \n3. **Set up an automatic recurring buy (DCA)** \u2013 most exchanges above let you schedule daily/weekly buys as low as S$50.  \n4. **Immediately withdraw** purchased BTC to self-custody once it hits your threshold (e.g., every S$1 000).  \n5. **Track cost basis** in a spreadsheet or an open-source portfolio app.  Singapore has **no capital-gains tax**; profits are only taxable if trading is a business activity, but keeping clean records helps if MAS or IRAS ever requests clarification.  \n\n---\n\n## 6  Staying compliant & informed\n\n* **Stay on the MPI list:** MAS updates the directory often; a licence can be suspended or revoked. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n* **Watch MAS consultations** \u2013 new rules on leverage limits and advertising guidelines are expected to be finalised in 2025-H2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n* **Avoid unlicensed \u201cglobal\u201d platforms** that accept SGD via third-party payment processors; you have no recourse if they fail.  Luno\u2019s orderly exit highlighted the importance of regulated status. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 7  Bottom line\nFor a Singapore resident seeking maximum credibility, your first filter should be **\u201cMPI licence in hand.\u201d**  Coinbase, Coinhako, Independent Reserve and Crypto.com all clear that bar and have multi-year operating track-records.  OKX and Gemini look promising but are still finalising full licences.  If you qualify as an accredited investor, DBS Digital Exchange offers unparalleled bank-custody but at higher minimums.  Regardless of platform, **the ultimate security remains self-custody** with rigorous operational hygiene.  Treat exchanges as transient storefronts, not vaults, and you will enjoy the benefits of bitcoin accumulation without taking on needless counter-party risk."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":1077,"end_idx":1096,"safe_urls":["https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution?activity=Digital+Payment+Token+Service&category=Major+Payment+Institution&sector=Payments&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([eservices.mas.gov.sg](https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution?activity=Digital+Payment+Token+Service&category=Major+Payment+Institution&sector=Payments&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Financial Institutions Directory - Monetary Authority of Singapore","url":"https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution?activity=Digital+Payment+Token+Service&category=Major+Payment+Institution&sector=Payments&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Licence Type/Status: Major Payment Institution \u00d7.

KuCoin and AscendEX were hacked before final licensing, while Crypto.com and Bybit were already heavyweight operators.  \n2. **Scrutinise an exchange\u2019s custody design and proof-of-reserves cadence.** Hot-wallet discipline (5 % rule), multi-sig or MPC cold storage and real-time Merkle-tree attestations are now industry minimums.  \n3. **Assess incident-response and transparency.** Coinhako and Bitrue reimbursed users quickly and published post-mortems; DragonEx went dark for weeks.  \n4. **Watch MAS enforcement bulletins and the Investor Alert List.** A listing can precede service suspension (Binance) or signal licence withdrawal (Luno).  \n5. **Maintain self-custody for strategic holdings.** Every major hack above exploited exchange-controlled keys\u2014not user-held hardware wallets.\n\n---\n\n## 4\u2002How to keep track\n\n* **MAS public register & enforcement page** \u2013 real-time licensing status and reprimands.  \n* **Exchange-issued \u2018proof-of-reserves\u2019 dashboards and SOC/ISO audit reports.**  \n* **Blockchain analytics alerts** (e.g., Chainalysis, TRM) for large outflows from exchange wallets.  \n* **Cyber-security advisories** (FBI, CSA) for APT activity against crypto operators.  \n\nBy combining regulatory hygiene with personal self-custody discipline, Singaporean investors can mitigate both exchange-level security failures and sudden compliance disruptions."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn5search5\ue201","start_idx":1075,"end_idx":1107,"safe_urls":["https://cointelegraph.com/news/most-significant-hacks-of-2019-new-record-of-twelve-in-one-year?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/26/singapore-based-crypto-exchange-dragonex-has-been-hacked?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/26/singapore-based-crypto-exchange-dragonex-has-been-hacked?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/most-significant-hacks-of-2019-new-record-of-twelve-in-one-year?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Singapore-Based Crypto Exchange DragonEx Has Been Hacked","url":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/26/singapore-based-crypto-exchange-dragonex-has-been-hacked?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1553558400.0,"snippet":"Singapore-based exchange DragonEx says it has been hacked for an undisclosed amount in a large number of cryptocurrencies.

Binance.com, by contrast, withdrew its local licence bid in 2021 after MAS ordered it to stop servicing Singapore retail users and still sits on the **Investor Alert List**. You can still reach Binance offshore for its ultralow fees, 350 + token roster and derivatives suite, but you do so without MAS protection and with a longer breach record.

In addition to the bitcoin theft, the hackers also accessed user two-factor authentication codes and API tokens. The cyberattack was well-orchestrated involving phishing, viruses, and multiple independent accounts. Although Binance's hot wallet, connected to the internet, was compromised, the losses represent only 2% of Binance's total bitcoin holdings. Binance has committed to covering the losses from its Secure Asset Fund for Users. Trading will continue despite the incident, although deposits and withdrawals are temporarily disabled. The breach emphasizes the ongoing risks in the cryptocurrency market and the sector's vulnerability to cyberattacks. Binance's decision against rolling back the bitcoin network reflects concerns about the potential undermining of trust in bitcoin's security and immutability. Users are urged to update their API keys and authentication codes immediately.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"WIRED"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":6427,"end_idx":6427,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Coinbase obtains Major Payment Institution licence from the ...","url":"https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-obtains-major-payment-institution-licence-from-the-monetary?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Coinbase"},{"title":"coinbase singapore pte. ltd. -

The breach involved stolen names, addresses, and emails but did not affect login credentials or passwords. The company will reimburse users deceived into transferring funds to the attackers. The hackers reportedly paid third-party contractors and employees, who have since been terminated, to gather sensitive information. Additionally, Coinbase is under investigation by the U.S. SEC for potentially misstating user data, although the company denies any compliance violations. This regulatory scrutiny persists even after the SEC dropped a separate lawsuit against Coinbase. The breach and probe come as Coinbase prepares to join the S&P 500 index and marks another blow to crypto industry security, which suffered $2.2 billion in stolen funds in 2024 alone. Coinbase has refused to meet a $20 million ransom demand and is now offering a reward for information on the attackers. It is also strengthening its security measures, including launching a new U.S.-based support hub, to mitigate future risks.

May 2025 insider-driven breach exposed identity-level data on about 69 000 customers, sparked a US $20 million extortion demand and could cost the exchange up to US $400 million to remediate; no passwords, private keys or customer funds were taken, but the incident highlights weak controls around outsourced support staff and raises fresh questions about Coinbase\u2019s vendor-risk governance\u2014even as its rapid disclosure, refusal to pay ransom, and aggressive clean-up (firing insiders, offering a US$20 million bounty, and moving support operations on-shore) demonstrate a comparatively transparent and well-capitalised response.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn3news7\ue201**\n\n---\n\n##

\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn0news41\ue201 |\n\n### Data Exposed\n* **Personal identifiers:** names, postal & email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, last four SSN digits or national-ID numbers.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \n* **KYC documents:** images of driver\u2019s licences, passports, and (for some) proof-of-residency files.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n* **Account metadata:** internal customer-ID, masked bank-account numbers, balances and transaction histories.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn3search2\ue201  \n\nCritically, **no passwords, private keys, API keys or on-chain assets were taken**; the theft was limited to data that could enable targeted phishing or identity fraud.\ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause & Technical Analysis\n* Attackers used **social engineering and direct bribes** (reported at US $4 000\u2013US $5 000 per agent) to convince third-party call-centre staff in India and the Philippines to run illicit database queries and download CSV files.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn2search5\ue201  \n* Internal monitoring did flag atypical queries in March\u2013April, but correlation gaps meant the pattern wasn\u2019t escalated until the extortion email arrived.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn3search2\ue201  \n* No critical production systems were breached; the compromise exploited **over-broad role-based access** in CRM and KYC document repositories.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Coinbase\u2019s Response\n| Measure | Detail | Source |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| **Public disclosure** | 8-K filed

|\n\nSecurity researchers generally praise the **speed and depth of disclosure** but fault Coinbase for not enforcing least-privilege on support roles sooner.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory & Legal Fallout\n* **SEC & State AG reviews:** The SEC has asked follow-up questions about breach timing and whether Coinbase\u2019s earlier user-metric disclosures were misleading.\ue200cite\ue202turn0news41\ue201  \n* **Possible MAS scrutiny:** While MAS has not yet commented publicly, under the Payment Services Act Coinbase must report \u201cmaterial cyber incidents\u201d within 24 h\u2014regulators are expected to examine its third-party-risk framework.  \n* **Class-action suits** in at least three U.S. districts claim negligence and violation of state data-breach statutes.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Credibility Re-Assessment\n\n| Dimension | Pre-Breach Standing | Post-Breach Assessment |\n|-----------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| **Regulatory status** | Full MAS MPI and 40+ licences globally | Unchanged, but likely faces tighter audits on vendor management. |\n| **Security track record** | No exchange-level hacks of customer funds; SOC 2 audited | First major **data** compromise highlights insider-threat gap. Still no asset loss, but privacy risk elevated. |\n| **Transparency & Governance** | Quarterly US GAAP reports; real-time PoR; ISO 27001 | Rapid 8-K + detailed blog suggests culture of disclosure remains intact. |\n| **Financial resilience** | > US $6 bn cash (Q1 2025) | Can absorb US $400 m hit without solvency stress; Moody\u2019s left rating unchanged. |\n| **User trust trajectory** | High among regulators, moderate among power traders (fees) | Short-term dent\u2014especially for high-net-worth users wary after Ledger-style leaks\u2014but mitigated by proactive remedies. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Coinbase remains one of the most regulated and well-capitalised crypto venues, and the breach did **not** compromise funds or system integrity. However, the incident exposes a soft underbelly in its outsourced support stack. Expect MAS, SEC and EU regulators to demand stricter least-privilege controls and real-time DLP monitoring. For users, Coinbase is still a credible on-ramp, but until it demonstrates hardened vendor governance, prudent investors should (a) enable hardware-key 2FA, (b) minimise personal data shared, and (c) withdraw crypto to self-custody immediately after purchase."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn3news7\ue201","start_idx":641,"end_idx":723,"safe_urls":["https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/coinbase-says-customers-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/coinbase-says-cyber-criminals-stole-account-data-some-customers-2025-05-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978825000094/coin-20250514.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/21/coinbase_confirms_insider_breach_affects/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/coinbase-says-customers-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/21/coinbase_confirms_insider_breach_affects/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/coinbase-says-cyber-criminals-stole-account-data-some-customers-2025-05-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978825000094/coin-20250514.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/coinbase-says-cyber-criminals-stole-account-data-some-customers-2025-05-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Coinbase says customers' personal information stolen in data breach","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/coinbase-says-customers-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1747267200.0,"snippet":"The company said the hacker stole customer names, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, and the last four digits of users' Social Security ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"TechCrunch"},{"title":"Coinbase confirms insider breach affects 70000 users -

The breach involved stolen names, addresses, and emails but did not affect login credentials or passwords. The company will reimburse users deceived into transferring funds to the attackers. The hackers reportedly paid third-party contractors and employees, who have since been terminated, to gather sensitive information. Additionally, Coinbase is under investigation by the U.S. SEC for potentially misstating user data, although the company denies any compliance violations. This regulatory scrutiny persists even after the SEC dropped a separate lawsuit against Coinbase. The breach and probe come as Coinbase prepares to join the S&P 500 index and marks another blow to crypto industry security, which suffered $2.2 billion in stolen funds in 2024 alone. Coinbase has refused to meet a $20 million ransom demand and is now offering a reward for information on the attackers. It is also strengthening its security measures, including launching a new U.S.-based support hub, to mitigate future risks.

The breach involved stolen names, addresses, and emails but did not affect login credentials or passwords. The company will reimburse users deceived into transferring funds to the attackers. The hackers reportedly paid third-party contractors and employees, who have since been terminated, to gather sensitive information. Additionally, Coinbase is under investigation by the U.S. SEC for potentially misstating user data, although the company denies any compliance violations. This regulatory scrutiny persists even after the SEC dropped a separate lawsuit against Coinbase. The breach and probe come as Coinbase prepares to join the S&P 500 index and marks another blow to crypto industry security, which suffered $2.2 billion in stolen funds in 2024 alone. Coinbase has refused to meet a $20 million ransom demand and is now offering a reward for information on the attackers. It is also strengthening its security measures, including launching a new U.S.-based support hub, to mitigate future risks. Coinbase shares dropped 6.5% following the announcement.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":7}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn3search2\ue201","start_idx":3847,"end_idx":3879,"safe_urls":["https://cloudprotection.withsecure.com/blog/coinbase-breach-what-happened-and-what-it-means-for-salesforce-security/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/22/major-wake-up-call-how-usd400m-coinbase-breach-exposes-crypto-s-dark-side?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([WithSecure Salesforce Protection](https://cloudprotection.withsecure.com/blog/coinbase-breach-what-happened-and-what-it-means-for-salesforce-security/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/22/major-wake-up-call-how-usd400m-coinbase-breach-exposes-crypto-s-dark-side?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Coinbase Breach 2025: Lessons for Salesforce Security","url":"https://cloudprotection.withsecure.com/blog/coinbase-breach-what-happened-and-what-it-means-for-salesforce-security/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1747267200.0,"snippet":"What the Coinbase breach reveals about support risks, insider threats, social engineering, and how to secure Salesforce in real-time.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"WithSecure Salesforce Protection"},{"title":"'Major Wake-Up Call': How $400M Coinbase Breach ... - CoinDesk","url":"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/22/major-wake-up-call-how-usd400m-coinbase-breach-exposes-crypto-s-dark-side?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1747938083.632,"snippet":"Coinbase said 69461 customers were initially impacted by the breach, but fears remain over the threat of real-world robberies.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"CoinDesk"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news41\ue201","start_idx":4075,"end_idx":4093,"safe_urls":["https://www.investopedia.com/why-coinbase-stock-plunged-thursday-update-11735309?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/why-coinbase-stock-plunged-thursday-update-11735309?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Why Coinbase Stock Plunged Thursday","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/why-coinbase-stock-plunged-thursday-update-11735309?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1747312240.0,"snippet":"Coinbase Global's stock plummeted more than 7% on Thursday, closing just above $244, due to revelations of a cyberattack and an SEC investigation. Earlier in the week, the stock had surged following the announcement that Coinbase would be included in the S&P 500. In an SEC filing, Coinbase disclosed receiving a threatening email on May 11 from a party claiming to have accessed customer and internal data, reportedly obtained through bribing non-U.S. contractors and employees. Although no passwords or customer funds were compromised, sensitive data such as names, Social Security digits, and transaction history may have been exposed. The company estimates the incident could cost between $180 million and $400 million for remediation and voluntary customer reimbursements. Furthermore, The New York Times reported that the SEC is probing Coinbase over its reporting of \"verified users\" prior to its 2021 IPO\u2014a metric the company ceased using in 2023. Coinbase's legal officer described the investigation as a remnant from the previous administration and expressed hopes for its resolution.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Investopedia"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201","start_idx":4446,"end_idx":4465,"safe_urls":["https://milberg.com/news/coinbase-data-breach-class-action-lawsuit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Milberg
