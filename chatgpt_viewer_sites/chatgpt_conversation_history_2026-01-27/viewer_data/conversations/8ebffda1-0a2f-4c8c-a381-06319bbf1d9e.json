The subdirectory must be treated as a package or the path to the subdirectory must be added to Python's search path. Here are two common approaches to achieve this:\n\n### 1. Making the Subdirectory a Package\nTo make a subdirectory a package from which you can import modules, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create an `__init__.py` File:** In your subdirectory, create a file named `__init__.py`. This file can be empty, but its presence tells Python that the directory should be treated as a Python package.\n\n2. **Import the Module:** Assuming your directory structure looks something like this:\n    ```\n    my_project/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 my_subdirectory/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 my_module.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 my_notebook.ipynb\n    ```\n    You can import `my_module` in `my_notebook.ipynb` using:\n    ```python\n    from my_subdirectory import my_module\n    ```\n\n### 2. Adding the Subdirectory to the Python Path\nIf you prefer not to make the subdirectory a package or if you need to import modules dynamically, you can add the subdirectory to Python's search path at runtime:\n\n1. **Modify `sys.path`:** Add the path to your subdirectory to `sys.path` so Python knows where to look for it. Assuming the same directory structure as above, you can do the following in `my_notebook.ipynb`:\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    sys.path.append('my_subdirectory/')\n    import my_module\n    ```\n\nThis approach temporarily modifies the Python path for the current Jupyter session, allowing you to import modules from the specified subdirectory without needing to structure it as a package.\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your project's structure and requirements. Making the subdirectory a package is more formal and can be beneficial if you're building a larger, more complex project, while modifying `sys.path` is quicker for temporary or ad hoc imports."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","parent_id":"aaa2f86d-ec9f-4c61-8680-854a07303f18","request_id":"85ee96550cb3a081-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2f86d-ec9f-4c61-8680-854a07303f18","children":["aaa23308-1115-4cd0-80ff-8317fd3c991f"]},"aaa23308-1115-4cd0-80ff-8317fd3c991f":{"id":"aaa23308-1115-4cd0-80ff-8317fd3c991f","message":{"id":"aaa23308-1115-4cd0-80ff-8317fd3c991f","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1709521082.1841,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I tried Method 1.

In Python, relative imports do not use the `./` notation at the beginning. Instead, you should ensure that your project is structured as a package if you want to use relative imports, or you can use absolute imports by adding the necessary directories to your Python path.\n\nGiven the error, here's how you can correctly import your module without using the `./` syntax. Assuming you have the following directory structure:\n\n```\nmy_project/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 datapreprocessor_part_1.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 my_notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nYou should either make sure that `my_project` is recognized as a package (which might be more complex depending on how you're running Jupyter Lab) or more simply adjust the Python path as previously mentioned. \n\nHowever, since the first method did not work as expected for you, let's correct the approach using Python's `sys.path` for adding the subdirectory to the Python path, which doesn't require the package initialization via `__init__.py` files. This is a direct approach that modifies the environment's search path:\n\n1. **Determine the Path to Your Subdirectory:** First, you need to know the absolute path to the `src` directory or construct it relative to the notebook's location.\n\n2. **Add the Subdirectory to `sys.path`:** \n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport os\n\n# Assuming 'my_notebook.ipynb' is in the root directory of 'my_project'\n# and 'src' is also directly under 'my_project'\nproject_root = os.path.abspath('')  # Gets the current directory of the notebook\nsrc_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'src')  # Constructs the path to 'src'\n\nsys.path.append(src_path)\n\nfrom datapreprocessor_part_1 import load_and_clean\n```\n\nThis approach dynamically adds your `src` directory to the Python path, allowing you to import from `datapreprocessor_part_1.py` without encountering a syntax error. Make sure that the paths are correctly defined relative to your notebook's location."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","parent_id":"aaa23308-1115-4cd0-80ff-8317fd3c991f","request_id":"85ee9a2a6eb35e3d-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa23308-1115-4cd0-80ff-8317fd3c991f","children":["aaa290a8-4116-4456-bc9a-323eca4af175"]},"aaa290a8-4116-4456-bc9a-323eca4af175":{"id":"aaa290a8-4116-4456-bc9a-323eca4af175","message":{"id":"aaa290a8-4116-4456-bc9a-323eca4af175","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1709521221.914827,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["It worked!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"85ee9d93bfa31738-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2275a83a-3b3c-4125-b238-cab5414b03ed","children":["35d784a6-bf71-4aa3-ae4f-dcd94e49fdb0"]},"35d784a6-bf71-4aa3-ae4f-dcd94e49fdb0":{"id":"35d784a6-bf71-4aa3-ae4f-dcd94e49fdb0","message":{"id":"35d784a6-bf71-4aa3-ae4f-dcd94e49fdb0","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1709521224.291223,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Fantastic!
