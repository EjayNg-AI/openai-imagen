The central bank, which controls monetary policy through the exchange rate, has slightly reduced the slope of the S$NEER policy band, allowing for a modest appreciation of the Singapore dollar. Core inflation is now forecasted between 1.0% and 2.0% for 2025, down from the previously expected 1.5% to 2.5%. Headline inflation forecasts remain at 1.5%-2.5%. Singapore's GDP growth was 4% in 2024, surpassing the initial projection of 3.5%, but is expected to slow to 1%-3% in 2025. This decision marks a significant shift as MAS had tightened policy five times since October 2021 to combat pandemic-related inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. The Singapore dollar stabilized against the U.S. dollar, and the domestic stock index rose by 0.7% following the announcement.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1737679820.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-central-bank-keeps-monetary-policy-settings-unchanged-2025-07-30/","title":"Singapore central bank keeps monetary policy settings unchanged","snippet":"On July 30, 2025, Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), announced that it would maintain its existing monetary policy settings, following a stronger-than-expected economic performance in the second quarter. Specifically, MAS will keep the current rate of appreciation of its exchange rate-based policy band, known as the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER), unchanged, along with the width and center of the band.\n\nEarlier in the year, MAS had implemented two policy easings, and it now believes the current stance provides sufficient flexibility to address any medium-term risks to price stability. The decision came amid divided expectations among economists: half of the twelve analysts surveyed by Reuters anticipated no policy change, while the other half predicted an additional easing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51},"pub_date":1753834019.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.singstat.gov.sg","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/economy/balance-of-payments/visualising-data/balance-of-payments-dashboard","title":"Balance of Payments Dashboard","snippet":"Feb 14, 2025 \u2014 As of 2024, the current account surplus stood at $128 billion and amounted to 17.5% of GDP at current market prices while the capital and ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.singstat.gov.sg"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/economy/balance-of-payments","title":"Balance of Payments - Latest Data","snippet":"Latest News ; Balance of Payments ; Balance of Payments, S$m, 2Q 2025 ; Current Account Balance, S$m, 2Q 2025 ; Exports of Goods and Services.

This change involves slowing the appreciation rate of the Singapore dollar against a basket of trading partners' currencies. Unlike other central banks, MAS controls monetary policy through exchange rates rather than domestic interest rates, and this move effectively lowers borrowing costs in the trade-dependent economy. Recent data showed Singapore\u2019s core consumer price index rose just 1.8% in December, prompting MAS to lower its 2025 inflation forecast to 1-2%. The MAS anticipates slower GDP growth in 2025, projecting a decrease from 4% in 2024 to 1-3%. Despite initial declines, the Singapore dollar later traded at S$1.3526 per US dollar.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52},"pub_date":1737682452.452,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fcaa7ce0988325aa1a614296bc4135","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Analyzing USD/SGD Trend and Economic Drivers","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"7e3dec2d-2176-4f3b-a0c3-f10d62fac416","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"bde58a77-975b-423b-a8a4-9c966fc34711","turn_exchange_id":"56e04b20-73f9-4b4d-a72c-550f312f9330","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bde58a77-975b-423b-a8a4-9c966fc34711","children":["bc4a2d06-72d1-4e75-ba54-b3ea2c0de5cd"]},"bc4a2d06-72d1-4e75-ba54-b3ea2c0de5cd":{"id":"bc4a2d06-72d1-4e75-ba54-b3ea2c0de5cd","message":{"id":"bc4a2d06-72d1-4e75-ba54-b3ea2c0de5cd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761389191.026244,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Verifying news accuracy","content":"I need to be cautious with the information I pull.

The central bank, which controls monetary policy through the exchange rate, has slightly reduced the slope of the S$NEER policy band, allowing for a modest appreciation of the Singapore dollar. Core inflation is now forecasted between 1.0% and 2.0% for 2025, down from the previously expected 1.5% to 2.5%. Headline inflation forecasts remain at 1.5%-2.5%. Singapore's GDP growth was 4% in 2024, surpassing the initial projection of 3.5%, but is expected to slow to 1%-3% in 2025. This decision marks a significant shift as MAS had tightened policy five times since October 2021 to combat pandemic-related inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.

This decision comes amid improved global trade conditions and stronger-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter, which showed a 1.4% quarter-on-quarter GDP increase, helping the country avoid a technical recession. The choice to maintain policy contrasts with analyst expectations, which were evenly split between a policy hold and further easing.\n\nMAS cited easing trade tensions and more stable financial conditions since April as factors reducing the need for additional stimulus. Despite this, uncertainties remain, particularly around 2026, and Singapore\u2019s growth is expected to slow in the latter half of 2025 as the impact of frontloaded exports wanes. Core inflation has dropped to 0.6% year-on-year in June 2025 from 5.5% in early 2023. While OCBC and Maybank economists noted two-way inflation risks from tariff impacts and geopolitical shifts, Maybank forecasted Singapore\u2019s 2025 GDP growth at 3.2%, higher than the government's current 0.0\u20132.0% projection.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1753850895.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"am.jpmorgan.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://am.jpmorgan.com/dk/en/asset-management/liq/insights/liquidity-insights/updates/mas-dovish-shift-temporary-or-trend/","title":"MAS's dovish shift: Temporary or trend?","snippet":"Jan 24, 2025 \u2014 The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) adopted a more dovish stance by slightly reducing the slope of the SG$ NEER policy band, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"am.jpmorgan.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.centralbanking.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/7972157/singapore-eases-monetary-policy-for-first-time-since-2020","title":"Singapore eases monetary policy for first time since 2020","snippet":"Jan 24, 2025 \u2014 The MAS today (January 24) announced that it would slightly reduce the slope of the S$NEER policy band, which determines the Singapore dollar's ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1737722697.0,"attribution":"www.centralbanking.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"legal.economictimes.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://legal.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/law-policy/explainer-how-singapores-unique-monetary-policy-works/122994164","title":"EXPLAINER-How Singapore's unique monetary policy works","snippet":"Jul 30, 2025 \u2014 The three policy levers are the slope, the level and the width of the band.

This change involves slowing the appreciation rate of the Singapore dollar against a basket of trading partners' currencies. Unlike other central banks, MAS controls monetary policy through exchange rates rather than domestic interest rates, and this move effectively lowers borrowing costs in the trade-dependent economy. Recent data showed Singapore\u2019s core consumer price index rose just 1.8% in December, prompting MAS to lower its 2025 inflation forecast to 1-2%.

The European Union introduced a comprehensive plan to boost liquidity, underwrite bank debt, and recapitalize distressed banks, emulating the UK's \u00a3500bn package. Member states also raised the minimum guarantee on bank savings. \n\nBritain effectively nationalized RBS, HBOS, and Lloyds, extended liquidity schemes, guaranteed new bank debt, and prohibited short-selling. Countries like Ireland, Greece, and Germany increased guarantees on bank deposits and provided substantial funds to recapitalize banks and secure debt issuance. Denmark and France also injected capital into their banks and banned short-selling.\n\nNon-EU countries took similar measures. Iceland nationalized its major banks and sought external loans. Russia allocated significant liquidity and loan support to banks. Italy, Spain, Austria, and several other nations expanded guarantees on deposits, raised capital for banks, and imposed short-selling restrictions. \n\nThe US's $700bn bail-out was the most considerable intervention, also raising bank deposit guarantees. Canada, Australia, South Korea, and several Asian and Middle Eastern countries took steps including interest rate cuts, liquidity provision, and increased depositor protections to mitigate the crisis's impact.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1224579600.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_stimulus_program","title":"Chinese economic stimulus program","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1760323820.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_interest-rate_policy","title":"Zero interest-rate policy","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1760898088.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fcaa7ce0988325aa1a614296bc4135","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching USD/SGD trend and MAS policy statements","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"7e3dec2d-2176-4f3b-a0c3-f10d62fac416","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"5c43c4cf-2e34-4c7c-b0e6-498bc95d7359","turn_exchange_id":"56e04b20-73f9-4b4d-a72c-550f312f9330","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5c43c4cf-2e34-4c7c-b0e6-498bc95d7359","children":["960eab36-dfd1-4c30-8774-7e0eb27dccc1"]},"960eab36-dfd1-4c30-8774-7e0eb27dccc1":{"id":"960eab36-dfd1-4c30-8774-7e0eb27dccc1","message":{"id":"960eab36-dfd1-4c30-8774-7e0eb27dccc1","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761389225.748477,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing 2015\u20132016 policy actions","content":"I now have enough to explain the 2008\u20132009 policy effects.

The Greek parliament's vote to approve a controversial Christmas bonus for pensioners saw 196 in favor, despite the abstention of the New Democracy party. This move by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is part of the ongoing debate over anti-austerity measures, with various political parties, including the far-right Golden Dawn, supporting it.\n\nIn the broader European context, markets gained after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in a year, signaling three more increases in the coming year. This rate hike strengthened the dollar, which generally benefits banking shares. Despite this, commodity stocks fell due to a stronger greenback.\n\nGreece's controversial pension bonus, involving pre-Christmas fiscal gifts, led creditors to put debt relief on hold. Meanwhile, European markets also reacted to the Fed's decision, influencing banking and financial shares, while gold prices hit their lowest since February 2016 due to rising interest rates. \n\nFurther, Swiss central bank maintained its interest rates at minus 0.75%, noting political uncertainties including Brexit negotiations. Sterling's recovery influenced the UK's inflation forecasts, leading the Bank of England to suggest a possible rise in inflation for 2017.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1481826806.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_stock_market_selloff","title":"2015\u20132016 stock market selloff","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1760718771.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"arxiv.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01218","title":"World Financial 2014-2016 Market Bubbles: Oil Negative - US Dollar Positive","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"academia","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1464979074.0,"attribution":"arxiv.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fcaa7ce0988325aa1a614296bc4135","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching MAS easing and USD/SGD 2015-2016 surge","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"7e3dec2d-2176-4f3b-a0c3-f10d62fac416","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"53a688de-401f-4c12-a7da-77c7ddccfba7","turn_exchange_id":"56e04b20-73f9-4b4d-a72c-550f312f9330","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"53a688de-401f-4c12-a7da-77c7ddccfba7","children":["6f075a17-62d5-42ba-a70e-1c0fe39a568f"]},"6f075a17-62d5-42ba-a70e-1c0fe39a568f":{"id":"6f075a17-62d5-42ba-a70e-1c0fe39a568f","message":{"id":"6f075a17-62d5-42ba-a70e-1c0fe39a568f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761389233.120882,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Reviewing currency trends & MAS actions","content":"I want to be careful when talking about MAS actions in 2015, especially regarding slope reductions (January and April).

Economic uncertainties, rising debt levels, the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle, and potential recession risks were also factors.

Despite acknowledging the resilience of the U.S. economy and the dollar's role as a global reserve currency, Moody's warned that federal deficits are expected to rise to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, from 6.4% in 2024. This increase is attributed to higher interest payments, surging entitlement costs, and relatively weak revenue growth. Extending former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, a Republican priority, would contribute an additional $4 trillion to the primary deficit over the next decade. Moody's is the last of the major credit agencies to issue a downgrade, following Standard & Poor's in 2011 and Fitch in 2023. Political gridlock continues to hinder deficit-reduction efforts, with Republicans opposing tax hikes and Democrats resisting spending cuts. Efforts to pass a significant package of tax breaks and spending reductions failed in the House Budget Committee, as a coalition of hard-right Republicans and Democrats opposed the measure due to disagreements over Medicaid cuts and green energy incentives.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1747431349.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fcaa7ce0988325aa1a614296bc4135","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Fitch downgrade and US debt ceiling impact","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"7e3dec2d-2176-4f3b-a0c3-f10d62fac416","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"99bed9e7-a362-428f-9417-53362cfcf6a5","turn_exchange_id":"56e04b20-73f9-4b4d-a72c-550f312f9330","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"99bed9e7-a362-428f-9417-53362cfcf6a5","children":["ba78eb7c-5523-43c5-adcd-91bb81f77ca1"]},"ba78eb7c-5523-43c5-adcd-91bb81f77ca1":{"id":"ba78eb7c-5523-43c5-adcd-91bb81f77ca1","message":{"id":"ba78eb7c-5523-43c5-adcd-91bb81f77ca1","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761389241.271821,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Explaining USD/SGD long-run return","content":"Over the past 20 years, USD/SGD has dropped by roughly 22%, moving from 1.6639 in 2005 to 1.2949 in October 2025.

For the final quarter of 2024, a growth rate of 3.1% is expected, with an overall growth rate of 2.6% predicted for 2025. This revised forecast follows the trade ministry's recent adjustment of its GDP growth projection for 2024 to 3.5%, based on stronger-than-expected third-quarter growth of 5.4%. Despite the uptick in economic growth and decreasing inflation, the majority of economists expect MAS to maintain its current monetary policy in the upcoming reviews in January, April, and July. Headline and core inflation for 2024 are projected at 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively, slightly lower than previous estimates. Core inflation for the last quarter of 2024 and headline and core inflation for 2025 are expected to be in the range of 1.5% to 1.9%.

This delay would allow for assessment of incoming U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. The expected November inflation data shows core rates steady at October's three-year low of 2.1%. Analysts from DBS Bank and Moody's Analytics suggest the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will likely adopt a cautious approach akin to the U.S. Federal Reserve, waiting for concrete policies rather than speculative responses. The MAS uses the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) for policy adjustments, utilizing the slope, mid-point, and width of the policy band. A recent survey indicates a reduced expectation for a January policy easing, with some analysts like Maybank's Chua Hak Bin predicting a potential inflation drop below 2%, and a subsequent policy review influenced by global trade disruptions and lower import prices due to Trump's tariffs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1734676965.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.channelnewsasia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/monetary-authority-singapore-mas-monetary-policy-unchanged-3842691","title":"keeps monetary policy unchanged, expects Singapore's ...","snippet":"Oct 13, 2023 \u2014 MAS also announced that it is shifting to a quarterly monetary policy statement schedule from 2024.

This framework aims for low, stable inflation and tends to allow a **modest long-run SGD appreciation** against the basket\u2014hence USD/SGD\u2019s downward drift over two decades.

Conversely, when U.S. rate pressure fades, USD/SGD typically falls. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search5\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search7\ue201\n\n3) **Risk-on / risk-off and growth cycles.**  \nGlobal **risk-off** spikes (GFC **2008\u201309**; COVID **2020**) lift the USD as a safe haven; **risk-on** phases strengthen SGD as trade and regional growth recover. MAS policy responded counter-cyclically in 2008\u201309 and 2020 (flatten/re-centre), cushioning volatility but not fully offsetting global tides. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search9\ue202turn7search13\ue201\n\n4) **Singapore\u2019s strong external position.**  \nSingapore runs a persistent **current-account surplus** (\u2248**17\u201318% of GDP** in 2024; S$ **34.8bn** in Q2-2025), structurally supportive of the SGD and consistent with the long-run USD/SGD decline. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Political channels that mattered (and how much)\n\n- **U.S. policy & credibility shocks** (debt-ceiling brinkmanship; credit-rating downgrades in **2011**, **2023**, **2025**): these can **briefly** dent the USD, but the **dominant** driver has been **rate differentials** and growth. Still, they contribute to episodic USD softness/two-way volatility. \ue200cite\ue202turn9search12\ue202turn9search0\ue202turn9news22\ue201\n\n- **Trade policy shifts** (e.g., U.S.\u2013China frictions 2018\u201319; renewed tariff uncertainty in 2025): they influence Singapore\u2019s manufacturing/trade cycle and therefore MAS stance. Example: MAS **eased in Oct-2019** amid trade-war-linked slowdown; in **2025** MAS trimmed the slope as external demand softened. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search8\ue202turn3news20\ue201\n\n- **Singapore\u2019s institutional stability.**  \nMAS\u2019s **credible, rules-based** exchange-rate framework\u2014and its shift to **quarterly policy statements from 2024**\u2014anchors inflation expectations and reduces currency risk premia, a political-institutional advantage that supports SGD over the long run. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search6\ue202turn10search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- Over **2005\u21922025**, **USD/SGD fell \u224822%** (SGD strengthened), with **three major USD strength waves** (GFC, 2015\u201316 liftoff, 2022 Fed shock) temporarily reversing the broader trend.

The central bank, which controls monetary policy through the exchange rate, has slightly reduced the slope of the S$NEER policy band, allowing for a modest appreciation of the Singapore dollar. Core inflation is now forecasted between 1.0% and 2.0% for 2025, down from the previously expected 1.5% to 2.5%. Headline inflation forecasts remain at 1.5%-2.5%. Singapore's GDP growth was 4% in 2024, surpassing the initial projection of 3.5%, but is expected to slow to 1%-3% in 2025. This decision marks a significant shift as MAS had tightened policy five times since October 2021 to combat pandemic-related inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.

This decision comes amid improved global trade conditions and stronger-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter, which showed a 1.4% quarter-on-quarter GDP increase, helping the country avoid a technical recession. The choice to maintain policy contrasts with analyst expectations, which were evenly split between a policy hold and further easing.\n\nMAS cited easing trade tensions and more stable financial conditions since April as factors reducing the need for additional stimulus. Despite this, uncertainties remain, particularly around 2026, and Singapore\u2019s growth is expected to slow in the latter half of 2025 as the impact of frontloaded exports wanes. Core inflation has dropped to 0.6% year-on-year in June 2025 from 5.5% in early 2023. While OCBC and Maybank economists noted two-way inflation risks from tariff impacts and geopolitical shifts, Maybank forecasted Singapore\u2019s 2025 GDP growth at 3.2%, higher than the government's current 0.0\u20132.0% projection.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Singapore Dollars to U.S. Dollar Spot Exchange Rate (DEXSIUS) | FRED | St. Louis Fed","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXSIUS","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"FRED"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":2251,"end_idx":2310,"safe_urls":["https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap104v.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/018/2024/039/article-A001-en.xml?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mas.gov.sg/monetary-policy/singapores-monetary-policy-framework/faqs/section-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mas.gov.sg/monetary-policy/singapores-monetary-policy-framework/faqs/section-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Monetary Authority of Singapore](https://www.mas.gov.sg/monetary-policy/singapores-monetary-policy-framework/faqs/section-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"What is MAS' monetary policy framework and its rationale?","url":"https://www.mas.gov.sg/monetary-policy/singapores-monetary-policy-framework/faqs/section-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"MAS' intermediate target of monetary policy is the Singapore Dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER), which is a trade-weighted basket of currencies.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"How does MAS carry out its monetary policy?","url":"https://www.mas.gov.sg/monetary-policy/singapores-monetary-policy-framework/faqs/section-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"MAS' monetary policy settings, as defined by the slope, width and mid-point of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, are ...","attribution":"Monetary Authority of Singapore"},{"title":"Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Inflation in Singapore","url":"https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/018/2024/039/article-A001-en.xml?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Aug 13, 2024 \u2014 The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) operates a basket, band, and crawl (BBC) exchange rate-based monetary policy framework in which the ...","attribution":"IMF eLibrary"},{"title":"Reserve management and motivations for FX interventions","url":"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap104v.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) undertakes foreign exchange intervention operations to ensure that the S$NEER stays within the policy band.

This marked the loss of the last triple-A rating the U.S. held, following previous downgrades by Fitch Ratings in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings in 2011. Moody's explained that successive administrations and Congress have repeatedly failed to implement effective measures to curb large budget deficits and rising entitlement costs, projecting continuing fiscal deterioration over the next decade.
