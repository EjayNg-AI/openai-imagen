China's uneven economic start this year saw accelerated retail sales growth but contracting consumer and producer prices and sluggish exports. The industrial sector has faced continuous profit contractions for three consecutive years, with a 3.3% decrease in 2024. Additionally, the US tariffs have driven retailers to seek price cuts from Chinese suppliers, compounding business difficulties. The government's response includes pledging more fiscal stimulus and implementing a \"special action plan\" to spur consumption and target 5% growth. Despite some positive profits from state-owned and foreign firms, private-sector companies faced a 9% fall. Global banks have raised growth forecasts due to stimulus measures, but tariff risks remain a concern.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":791,"end_idx":792,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"China's industrial profits fall in January-February as economic risks mount","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-industrial-profits-fall-first-2-months-underline-slow-economic-recovery-2025-03-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1743046203.0,"snippet":"China's industrial profits slipped in the first two months of 2025, signalling a challenging period ahead for businesses as they navigate persistent deflationary forces and an escalating trade war wi...","attribution_segments":["523-1"],"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Mixed Q1 signals from China: Growth emerges but so do new ...","url":"https://www.conference-board.org/research/economy-watch-china/Economy-Watch-China-View-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1743572338.528697,"snippet":"Data for the first two months of 2025 suggest that the supply side of the economy remains solid and the demand side relatively weak, ...","attribution":"The Conference Board"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"\ue203","start_idx":819,"end_idx":820,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"China's rapidly aging demographic is shrinking the workforce and increasing the dependency ratio, posing long-term economic challenges.
