Here\u2019s a detailed comparison:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Omega-3 Content**\n- **Wild Salmon:** Typically contains **2,000\u20132,600 mg of omega-3s per 100g**.\n- **Farmed Salmon:** Higher overall fat content but slightly less omega-3 per gram, around **1,800\u20132,000 mg per 100g**.\n- **Why?** Farmed salmon is fed processed pellets, while wild salmon consumes a natural diet of krill and smaller fish.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Fat & Calories**\n- **Wild Salmon:** Leaner, with around **140\u2013180 kcal per 100g** and **5-7% fat**.\n- **Farmed Salmon:** Higher in fat, around **210\u2013280 kcal per 100g** and **11-15% fat**.\n- **Why?** Farmed salmon is bred for rapid growth, leading to higher fat deposits.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Contaminants & Pollutants**\n- **Wild Salmon:** Lower in contaminants, as it eats a natural diet.\n- **Farmed Salmon:** May contain **higher levels of PCBs, dioxins, and heavy metals** due to processed feed.\n- **Risk Mitigation:** Some farms use cleaner feeds, and regulations have reduced toxin levels.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Antibiotics & Additives**\n- **Wild Salmon:** No antibiotics or artificial coloring.\n- **Farmed Salmon:** Often treated with antibiotics (especially in less regulated farms) and given carotenoid additives (astaxanthin) to achieve pink flesh.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Environmental Impact**\n- **Wild Salmon:** Overfishing and habitat destruction are concerns, but it is a natural part of the ecosystem.\n- **Farmed Salmon:** Fish farms can pollute surrounding waters with waste, disease, and escaped fish competing with wild populations.\n- **Sustainability:** Some farms (e.g., those certified by the **Aquaculture Stewardship Council**) follow eco-friendly practices.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Taste & Texture**\n- **Wild Salmon:** Firmer, more intense flavor due to a natural diet.\n- **Farmed Salmon:** Softer texture, milder taste, higher fat content.\n\n---\n\n### **Which is Better?**\n- **Wild salmon** is superior for nutrition, lower contaminants, and environmental sustainability.\n- **Farmed salmon** is more affordable and available year-round, with higher fat content for those needing extra calories.\n\nWould you like specific recommendations on buying the best quality farmed or wild salmon?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"5df1c281-82c7-422f-8d69-15d5834af001","request_id":"913ee685bccf6593-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5df1c281-82c7-422f-8d69-15d5834af001","children":[]}}}
