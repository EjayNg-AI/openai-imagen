Not strictly a lease matter, but include PDPA clause in your operations. |\n\n---\n\n### 3\u202f\u202fMarket\u2011practice observations & negotiation pointers\n\n1. **Late\u2011payment regime** \u2013 Replace \u201c10\u202f%\u202fper\u202fmonth\u201d with \u201c3\u202f%\u202fp.a. above DBS Prime, calculated daily\u201d.  \n2. **Landlord sale termination** \u2013 Either delete, or require a **six\u2011month rent\u2011free period** as compensation, or the landlord to secure equivalent premises within 1\u202fkm at same rent.  \n3. **Quiet enjoyment** \u2013 Clause\u202f3(e) is good but add: \u201cLandlord warrants it has HDB/URA consent to lease for tuition use.\u201d  \n4. **Force majeure / pandemic closure** \u2013 Not covered. Consider adding a *rent\u2011abatement* clause tied to mandatory government closure (e.g. MOH or MOE directive).  \n5. **Renewal formula** \u2013 Propose \u201cprevailing rent **but capped at +8\u202f% over current rent** or as determined by an independent valuer, whichever lower\u201d.  \n6. **Fire\u2011safety & fit\u2011out** \u2013 Insert landlord approval timeline (e.g. *\u201cshall not unreasonably withhold consent and shall respond within 14\u202fdays\u201d*) so fit\u2011out works stay on schedule.  \n7. **Deposit refund mechanics** \u2013 Clarify that refund is **within 14\u202fdays of joint inspection** rather than expiry per se.  \n8. **Utilities caps** \u2013 If utility bills are unpredictable, negotiate a sub\u2011meter or agree a load cap so you are not billed for neighbours\u2019 consumption.  \n9. **Commission claw\u2011back** \u2013 Cap reimbursement to **1\u202fmonth\u2019s rent** maximum.  \n10. **Dispute resolution** \u2013 No mediation / arbitration clause. Consider inserting *Singapore Mediation Centre* as first step to avoid costly litigation.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u202f\u202fAction checklist before you sign\n\n| Step | Deadline | Responsible |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Confirm URA \u201cEducation/Training Centre\u201d approval & HDB landlord consent | Before 1\u202fJun\u202f2025 | Landlord (obtain letter) |\n| Negotiate late\u2011interest, sale termination & self\u2011help eviction language | This week | You / agent |\n| Prepare Schedule of Condition photos | Before key collection | You |\n| Arrange **public\u2011liability insurance** (recommend \u2265\u202fS$1\u202fm) | Before opening | You |\n| Engage air\u2011con contractor & keep quarterly invoices | Ongoing | You |\n| File e\u2011stamp (IRAS) | Within 14\u202fdays of signing | You |\n| Register / update MOE Private School status (if >10 students/class) | Before classes start | You |\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe template is broadly standard, but three clauses need immediate attention:\n\n1. **Exorbitant 10\u202f%\u202fper\u202fmonth late\u2011interest and automatic 7\u2011day eviction** \u2013 renegotiate to statutory norms and court\u2011supervised re\u2011entry.  \n2. **Landlord\u2019s 5\u2011month sale termination right** \u2013 either remove or secure fair compensation.  \n3. **Lack of explicit approvals & insurance warranties** \u2013 get landlord warranties and align insurance obligations.\n\nResolve these points, append a detailed Schedule of Condition, and the lease should be commercially and legally sound for a tuition\u2011centre operation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":340,"end_idx":357,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":7341,"end_idx":7358,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":340,"end_idx":357,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Tenancy Agreement-Industrial Commercial.pdf","id":"file-RPyWb4ikBxegvXNewrVsJP","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":7341,"end_idx":7358,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Tenancy Agreement-Industrial Commercial.pdf","id":"file-RPyWb4ikBxegvXNewrVsJP","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null}],"citations":[{"start_ix":340,"end_ix":357,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Tenancy Agreement-Industrial Commercial.pdf","id":"file-RPyWb4ikBxegvXNewrVsJP","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":6,"search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":7341,"end_ix":7358,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Tenancy Agreement-Industrial Commercial.pdf","id":"file-RPyWb4ikBxegvXNewrVsJP","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":6,"search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}}],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"02d6636b-fd0d-4cbe-b6c7-0a42c57af0f9","request_id":"9319348079f69e22-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"02d6636b-fd0d-4cbe-b6c7-0a42c57af0f9","children":[]}}}
