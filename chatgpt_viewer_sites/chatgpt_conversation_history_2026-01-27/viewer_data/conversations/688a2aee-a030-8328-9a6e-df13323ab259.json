Humanity is close to building digital superintelligence, and at least so far it\u2019s much less weird than it seems like it should be.\r\n\r\nRobots are not yet walking the streets, nor are most of us talking to AI all day. People still die of disease, we still can\u2019t easily go to space, and there is a lot about the universe we don\u2019t understand.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, we have recently built systems that are smarter than people in many ways, and are able to significantly amplify the output of people using them. The least-likely part of the work is behind us; the scientific insights that got us to systems like GPT-4 and o3 were hard-won, but will take us very far.\r\n\r\nAI will contribute to the world in many ways, but the gains to quality of life from AI driving faster scientific progress and increased productivity will be enormous; the future can be vastly better than the present. Scientific progress is the biggest driver of overall progress; it\u2019s hugely exciting to think about how much more we could have.\r\n\r\nIn some big sense, ChatGPT is already more powerful than any human who has ever lived. Hundreds of millions of people rely on it every day and for increasingly important tasks; a small new capability can create a hugely positive impact; a small misalignment multiplied by hundreds of millions of people can cause a great deal of negative impact.\r\n\r\n2025 has seen the arrival of agents that can do real cognitive work; writing computer code will never be the same. 2026 will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights. 2027 may see the arrival of robots that can do tasks in the real world.\r\n\r\nA lot more people will be able to create software, and art. But the world wants a lot more of both, and experts will probably still be much better than novices, as long as they embrace the new tools. Generally speaking, the ability for one person to get much more done in 2030 than they could in 2020 will be a striking change, and one many people will figure out how to benefit from.\r\n\r\nIn the most important ways, the 2030s may not be wildly different. People will still love their families, express their creativity, play games, and swim in lakes.\r\n\r\nBut in still-very-important-ways, the 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before. We do not know how far beyond human-level intelligence we can go, but we are about to find out.\r\n\r\nIn the 2030s, intelligence and energy\u2014ideas, and the ability to make ideas happen\u2014are going to become wildly abundant. These two have been the fundamental limiters on human progress for a long time; with abundant intelligence and energy (and good governance), we can theoretically have anything else.\r\n\r\nAlready we live with incredible digital intelligence, and after some initial shock, most of us are pretty used to it. Very quickly we go from being amazed that AI can generate a beautifully-written paragraph to wondering when it can generate a beautifully-written novel; or from being amazed that it can make live-saving medical diagnoses to wondering when it can develop the cures; or from being amazed it can create a small computer program to wondering when it can create an entire new company. This is how the singularity goes: wonders become routine, and then table stakes.\r\n\r\nWe already hear from scientists that they are two or three times more productive than they were before AI. Advanced AI is interesting for many reasons, but perhaps nothing is quite as significant as the fact that we can use it to do faster AI research. We may be able to discover new computing substrates, better algorithms, and who knows what else. If we can do a decade\u2019s worth of research in a year, or a month, then the rate of progress will obviously be quite different.\r\n\r\nFrom here on, the tools we have already built will help us find further scientific insights and aid us in creating better AI systems. Of course this isn\u2019t the same thing as an AI system completely autonomously updating its own code, but nevertheless this is a larval version of recursive self-improvement.\r\n\r\nThere are other self-reinforcing loops at play. The economic value creation has started a flywheel of compounding infrastructure buildout to run these increasingly-powerful AI systems. And robots that can build other robots (and in some sense, datacenters that can build other datacenters) aren\u2019t that far off. \r\n\r\nIf we have to make the first million humanoid robots the old-fashioned way, but then they can operate the entire supply chain\u2014digging and refining minerals, driving trucks, running factories, etc.\u2014to build more robots, which can build more chip fabrication facilities, data centers, etc, then the rate of progress will obviously be quite different.\r\n\r\nAs datacenter production gets automated, the cost of intelligence should eventually converge to near the cost of electricity. (People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses; the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes. It also uses about 0.000085 gallons of water; roughly one fifteenth of a teaspoon.)\r\n\r\nThe rate of technological progress will keep accelerating, and it will continue to be the case that people are capable of adapting to almost anything. There will be very hard parts like whole classes of jobs going away, but on the other hand the world will be getting so much richer so quickly that we\u2019ll be able to seriously entertain new policy ideas we never could before. We probably won\u2019t adopt a new social contract all at once, but when we look back in a few decades, the gradual changes will have amounted to something big.\r\n\r\nIf history is any guide, we will figure out new things to do and new things to want, and assimilate new tools quickly (job change after the industrial revolution is a good recent example). Expectations will go up, but capabilities will go up equally quickly, and we\u2019ll all get better stuff. We will build ever-more-wonderful things for each other. People have a long-term important and curious advantage over AI: we are hard-wired to care about other people and what they think and do, and we don\u2019t care very much about machines.\r\n\r\nA subsistence farmer from a thousand years ago would look at what many of us do and say we have fake jobs, and think that we are just playing games to entertain ourselves since we have plenty of food and unimaginable luxuries. I hope we will look at the jobs a thousand years in the future and think they are very fake jobs, and I have no doubt they will feel incredibly important and satisfying to the people doing them.\r\n\r\nThe rate of new wonders being achieved will be immense. It\u2019s hard to even imagine today what we will have discovered by 2035; maybe we will go from solving high-energy physics one year to beginning space colonization the next year; or from a major materials science breakthrough one year to true high-bandwidth brain-computer interfaces the next year. Many people will choose to live their lives in much the same way, but at least some people will probably decide to \u201cplug in\u201d.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, this sounds hard to wrap our heads around. But probably living through it will feel impressive but manageable. From a relativistic perspective, the singularity happens bit by bit, and the merge happens slowly. We are climbing the long arc of exponential technological progress; it always looks vertical looking forward and flat going backwards, but it\u2019s one smooth curve. (Think back to 2020, and what it would have sounded like to have something close to AGI by 2025, versus what the last 5 years have actually been like.)\r\n\r\nThere are serious challenges to confront along with the huge upsides. We do need to solve the safety issues, technically and societally, but then it\u2019s critically important to widely distribute access to superintelligence given the economic implications. The best path forward might be something like:\r\n\r\nSolve the alignment problem, meaning that we can robustly guarantee that we get AI systems to learn and act towards what we collectively really want over the long-term (social media feeds are an example of misaligned AI; the algorithms that power those are incredible at getting you to keep scrolling and clearly understand your short-term preferences, but they do so by exploiting something in your brain that overrides your long-term preference).\r\n\r\nThen focus on making superintelligence cheap, widely available, and not too concentrated with any person, company, or country. Society is resilient, creative, and adapts quickly. If we can harness the collective will and wisdom of people, then although we\u2019ll make plenty of mistakes and some things will go really wrong, we will learn and adapt quickly and be able to use this technology to get maximum upside and minimal downside. Giving users a lot of freedom, within broad bounds society has to decide on, seems very important. The sooner the world can start a conversation about what these broad bounds are and how we define collective alignment, the better.\r\n\r\nWe (the whole industry, not just OpenAI) are building a brain for the world. It will be extremely personalized and easy for everyone to use; we will be limited by good ideas. For a long time, technical people in the startup industry have made fun of \u201cthe idea guys\u201d; people who had an idea and were looking for a team to build it. It now looks to me like they are about to have their day in the sun.\r\n\r\nOpenAI is a lot of things now, but before anything else, we are a superintelligence research company. We have a lot of work in front of us, but most of the path in front of us is now lit, and the dark areas are receding fast. We feel extraordinarily grateful to get to do what we do.\r\n\r\nIntelligence too cheap to meter is well within grasp. This may sound crazy to say, but if we told you back in 2020 we were going to be where we are today, it probably sounded more crazy than our current predictions about 2030.\r\n\r\nMay we scale smoothly, exponentially and uneventfully through superintelligence."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"967584bc3bc86bdf-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"635d6916-2187-4fab-8366-b1bfb2fdd3dd","children":["fcaaf8ea-2bfe-4487-8c54-d42d8f6fc8f8"]},"fcaaf8ea-2bfe-4487-8c54-d42d8f6fc8f8":{"id":"fcaaf8ea-2bfe-4487-8c54-d42d8f6fc8f8","message":{"id":"fcaaf8ea-2bfe-4487-8c54-d42d8f6fc8f8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753885455.1568854,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"967584bc3bc86bdf-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"af2b5475-51c0-46ab-bdd8-53cba824fdff","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"af2b5475-51c0-46ab-bdd8-53cba824fdff","children":["854c943c-7de3-45fc-9eb3-0b43ef41192e"]},"854c943c-7de3-45fc-9eb3-0b43ef41192e":{"id":"854c943c-7de3-45fc-9eb3-0b43ef41192e","message":{"id":"854c943c-7de3-45fc-9eb3-0b43ef41192e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753885459.841561,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing Altman's blog post","content":"The user wants a critical analysis of Sam Altman's blog post, \"The Gentle Singularity,\" focusing on contentious points.

Yet the historical meaning of \u201csingularity\u201d is an inflection where self\u2011improving, *autonomous* systems outpace human control. Today\u2019s frontier models\u2014including GPT\u20114 and o3\u2014still require vast human\u2011curated data, expert fine\u2011tuning, and hand\u2011built infrastructure. They do not improve themselves in an open\u2011ended way, nor can they reliably execute long\u2011horizon plans without supervision. Scholarly surveys of AI progress continue to show exponential *cost* growth for each incremental performance gain, rather than a cost collapse characteristic of a runaway take\u2011off. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 In other words, the curve is steep, but not yet singular.\n\n### 2\u202f\u202f\u201cAlready smarter than people in many ways\u201d  \nAltman claims current systems are \u201csmarter than people in many ways\u201d and that ChatGPT is \u201calready more powerful than any human who has ever lived.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  On narrow benchmarks\u2014e.g., code\u2011generation or bar\u2011exam multiple\u2011choice questions\u2014LLMs can indeed beat median human scores, but they remain brittle on adversarial or out\u2011of\u2011distribution inputs and still hallucinate factual content. Their lack of situational awareness, grounding, and stable long\u2011term memory limits them relative to individual human experts. Comparing an aggregated digital service used by millions to a single human also conflates *scale* with *individual capability*. Current empirical work on \u201csparks of AGI\u201d shows promise but also documents persistent reasoning gaps. Hence Altman\u2019s framing overstates parity on general intelligence and downplays these deficits.\n\n### 3\u202f\u202fCrisp timelines: agents in\u202f2025, novel scientific insight in\u202f2026, humanoid robots in\u202f2027  \nPredicting real\u2011world agents this year and factory\u2011capable humanoids by 2027 is bolder than many industrial road\u2011maps. Leading projects (Tesla Optimus, Figure\u202f01, Boston Dynamics Atlas\u2011Next) still struggle with dexterous manipulation, open\u2011set navigation, cost, and battery endurance. Even optimistic industry updates put *pilot* humanoid deployments late\u20112026 and \u201cuseful\u2010in\u2011production\u201d volumes closer to the early 2030s. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0news59\ue201  Scientific\u2011discovery agents likewise face barriers: trustworthy automated reasoning, data\u2011quality bottlenecks, and rigorous interpretability. Historic AI timelines have repeatedly slipped; Altman\u2019s schedule should be treated as a best\u2011case upper bound rather than median expectation.\n\n### 4\u202f\u202fRecursive self\u2011improvement lite  \nAltman argues that with AI\u2011enabled research, a \u201clarval\u201d form of recursive self\u2011improvement has begun. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  The feedback loop\u2014AI tools \u2192 faster AI research \u2192 better AI tools\u2014is real, but still mediated by human researchers and constrained by compute, data curation, and peer\u2011review cycles. Recent scaling\u2011law analyses show diminishing returns on raw compute absent algorithmic novelty. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  In other words, the loop exists but has friction; whether the friction drops fast enough to create an uncontrolled runaway is open, not settled.\n\n### 5\u202f\u202f\u201cIntelligence cost will converge to electricity cost\u201d  \nThe blog states that as datacenter production is automated, \u201cthe cost of intelligence should eventually converge to near the cost of electricity,\u201d quoting 0.34\u202fWh per ChatGPT query. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  Independent energy\u2011use estimates vary by an order of magnitude (0.2\u20132.9\u202fWh). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201  More importantly, electricity is only ~10\u201315\u202f% of total inference cost for state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art models; capital expenditure for GPUs, real estate, cooling, networking and R&D dominates. Even if robots automate datacenter construction, chip supply chains remain resource\u2011intensive and geographically concentrated. Thus the \u201celectricity\u2011only\u201d cost floor is aspirational and ignores embodied emissions and scarce upstream inputs (high\u2011grade silicon, rare\u2011earth magnets, HBM stacks).\n\n### 6\u202f\u202fJobs, wealth and the \u201cfake\u2011job\u201d future  \nAltman contends that whole job classes will vanish but the world will grow \u201cso much richer so quickly\u201d that adaptation will be smooth, echoing Industrial\u2011Revolution analogies. Empirical labour\u2011economics studies anticipate more uneven short\u2011run shocks: entry\u2011level cognitive roles, many in services, are highly automatable, while AI\u2011complementary jobs require reskilling that is slow and uneven. The WEF 2025 *Future of Jobs* survey projects net job creation of\u202f2\u202fmillion but expects 40\u202f% of firms to shrink headcount. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  The analogy to 19th\u2011century mechanisation overlooks the pace differential: steam power diffused over half a century, whereas foundation\u2011model APIs can reach global scale in months. Income distribution, bargaining power, and policy readiness therefore matter more than historical precedent suggests.\n\n### 7\u202f\u202fAlignment first, distribution second  \nAltman proposes a two\u2011step path: \u201cSolve the alignment problem\u201d then \u201cmake superintelligence cheap and widely available.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  This frames alignment as a tractable, one\u2011time prerequisite rather than an ongoing sociotechnical process. Contemporary alignment research emphasises how system capabilities and misalignment risks can co\u2011evolve\u2014new modes of failure emerge as models scale. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  Moreover, wide deployment before robust interpretability or value\u2011elicitation tooling could *increase* systemic risk, because ubiquitous systems amplify minor misalignments. Governance scholars also warn that distribution alone does not resolve concentrated *decision\u2011making power*: those who design pre\u2011training objectives, RLHF reward functions, and access policies shape downstream behaviour regardless of unit\u2011price.\n\n### 8\u202f\u202f\u201cScale smoothly, exponentially and uneventfully\u201d  \nThe essay closes with a wish that humanity will \u201cscale smoothly, exponentially and uneventfully through superintelligence.\u201d While desirable, it presumes geopolitical stability, supply\u2011chain resilience, and coordinated global governance\u2014conditions historically hard to sustain during disruptive technological waves. Strategic competition for compute fabs, critical minerals, and AI talent is already intensifying; AI regulation is fragmenting along regional lines. Counting on a smooth exponential therefore discounts real\u2011world friction and the non\u2011linear dynamics of political economy.\n\n---\n\n#### Forward\u2011looking take  \nAltman\u2019s narrative is energising\u2014it accurately highlights how AI could unlock unprecedented scientific and material abundance. Yet many of his most sweeping claims rest on optimistic timelines, cost projections, and societal adaptability assumptions that remain empirically uncertain or historically contested. Treating these projections as conditional scenarios rather than near\u2011inevitabilities provides a more robust foundation for policy and research prioritisation:\n\n*   **Invest steadily in alignment, interpretability and systemic\u2011risk science** under the assumption that perfect alignment is neither binary nor one\u2011off.  \n*   **Plan for concentrated power** even in a world of cheap inference; governance, open standards and antitrust tools should be developed in parallel with technical scaling.  \n*   **Prepare labour markets for high\u2011velocity shocks**, including transitional safety nets and large\u2011scale adult education tied to demonstrable AI\u2011complementarity.  \n*   **Model material and energy constraints realistically**, acknowledging capital costs, supply bottlenecks and ecological externalities.  \n*   **Stress\u2011test geopolitical fault lines** created by unequal access to compute and data, ensuring that \u201cwidely distributed\u201d intelligence does not become another locus of strategic rivalry.\n\nIf these guard\u2011rails evolve in tandem with capability growth, the gentle singularity may remain gentle. Otherwise, the exponential curve Altman celebrates could prove bumpier\u2014and more contentious\u2014than his blog suggests."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":848,"end_idx":867,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/html/2501.02156v3?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.02156v3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Race to Efficiency: A New Perspective on AI Scaling Laws - arXiv","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2501.02156v3?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1736294400.0,"snippet":"We introduce the relative-loss equation, a time- and efficiency-aware framework that extends classical AI scaling laws.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"arXiv"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":1127,"end_idx":1146,"safe_urls":["https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Gentle Singularity - Sam Altman","url":"https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749513600.0,"snippet":"The Gentle Singularity ...
