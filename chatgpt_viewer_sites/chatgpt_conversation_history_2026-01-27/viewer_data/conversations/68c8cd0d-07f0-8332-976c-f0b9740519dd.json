Wordfence covers the two big ticket items\u2014**WAF (firewall)** and **malware scanning**\u2014and that\u2019s the part that actually stops exploits. SiteGround\u2019s plugin mostly flips **hardening toggles** (XML-RPC off, prevent file edits, block user enumeration, etc.) and exposes a few host-integrated conveniences. Running both is optional, not required.\n\n### Recommended approach (your headless WP + HTML front end)\n- **Keep Wordfence** as your primary security layer:\n  - WAF in \u201cextended\u201d mode (auto_prepend optimization).\n  - 2FA for all admins.\n  - Brute-force/login rate limiting.\n  - Scanner + alerts.\n- **You can remove SiteGround Security Optimizer** to reduce plugin surface area, *provided* you replicate any hardening you actually want via `.htaccess`/wp-config (which you\u2019ve already been doing) and Site Tools (server-level WAF remains active regardless of the plugin).\n\n### If you prefer to keep both (totally fine), avoid overlap/conflict\nTurn **OFF** in SiteGround Security (because Wordfence already does them, and duplicates add complexity without real gain):\n- Login security stack: 2FA, CAPTCHA, limit-logins, \u201cchange login URL\u201d.\n- Any REST API restrictions. (Your front end fetches posts via the WP REST API. Locking it breaks your site.)\n- Any \u201cX-XSS-Protection\u201d header toggles (obsolete; can interfere).\n\nSafe to **KEEP ON** in SiteGround Security (if you like one-click hardening):\n- **Disable XML-RPC** (you don\u2019t need it; double-blocking is harmless).\n- **Block user enumeration** (`?author=` probes).\n- **Disable file editor** (wp-admin theme/plugin editor).\n- **Lock system files** (but beware: overly strict perms can break updates\u2014leave this OFF if you frequently update plugins/themes).\n- **Bot protection** (optional; if it causes false positives, let Wordfence handle rate limiting alone).\n\n### Notes specific to your setup\n- **REST API must remain open** for unauthenticated reads of posts (`/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`). Do **not** enable any \u201crestrict REST to logged-in users\u201d setting.\n- You already manage headers and rules in `.htaccess`; duplicating them in the SG plugin can add duplicate headers or fragile rules. Prefer your single source of truth.\n- SiteGround\u2019s **server-side WAF** (ModSecurity rules) is independent of the plugin\u2014you\u2019ll still benefit from it even if you uninstall the plugin.\n- **Speed Optimizer (caching)** is a different plugin; keep it if it helps your performance. It\u2019s unrelated to Wordfence.\n\n### Bottom line\n- For simplicity and least attack surface: **Wordfence + your current `.htaccess` hardening + SiteGround\u2019s server WAF** is sufficient.\n- If you keep SiteGround Security, treat it as a *settings panel* for a few hardening bits **not** already handled by Wordfence, and **leave its login/REST features off**."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"97fcf9e45fe4fdc2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"08304e09-eddb-4aef-9d09-57f3f30f6e93","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"08304e09-eddb-4aef-9d09-57f3f30f6e93","children":[]}}}
