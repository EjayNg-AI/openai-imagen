Entropy increase is about *our* (or any macroscopic observer\u2019s) loss of trackable information, not about literal erasure at the fundamental level.\n\nLet me unpack that carefully.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What do we even mean by \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201centropy\u201d?\n\nThere are three closely related notions:\n\n1. **Boltzmann entropy (statistical mechanics)**  \n   For a macroscopic state (e.g. \u201cgas with volume \\(V\\), energy \\(E\\)\u201d), there are many compatible microstates. Boltzmann entropy is  \n   \\[\n   S_B = k_B \\ln W\n   \\]  \n   where \\(W\\) is the number of microstates compatible with the macrostate. Higher entropy = more microstates = *less* information about which microstate you are in.\n\n2. **Shannon entropy (information theory)**  \n   For a probability distribution \\(\\{p_i\\}\\) over microstates:  \n   \\[\n   H = - \\sum_i p_i \\log p_i\n   \\]  \n   This measures \u201cmissing information\u201d: how many bits you\u2019d need, on average, to specify the actual state given this distribution. More entropy = more ignorance.\n\n3. **von Neumann entropy (quantum)**  \n   For a density matrix \\(\\rho\\):  \n   \\[\n   S(\\rho) = -\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho \\log \\rho)\n   \\]  \n   For a *pure* state of a closed quantum system, this is zero and stays zero under unitary evolution.\n\nAll three are measures of **missing information** about the exact microstate. So when entropy goes up, what increases is the *amount you don\u2019t know* (or cannot access), not necessarily that the universe itself has \u201cforgotten.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2. Classical closed systems: Liouville and coarse-graining\n\nIn classical Hamiltonian mechanics:\n\n- The exact microstate is a point in **phase space** (positions + momenta).\n- Time evolution is deterministic and **volume-preserving** in phase space (Liouville\u2019s theorem).\n\nTwo important consequences:\n\n1. **Fine-grained information is conserved.**  \n   If you track the exact microstate, its evolution is invertible. Knowing the present microstate, you can in principle reconstruct the past. No fundamental information destruction.\n\n2. **Entropy increase comes from coarse-graining.**  \n   In practice we don\u2019t track every \\(10^{23}\\) degrees of freedom. We partition phase space into \u201cmacrostates\u201d (cells) and only know which cell we\u2019re in, not the precise point inside it.  \n   \n   Under time evolution, an initially localized region in phase space gets stretched and folded into an incredibly filamented structure. At the fine-grained level, its volume stays the same, but when you *coarse-grain* (average over cells), the distribution looks more uniform \u2192 higher coarse-grained entropy.\n\nSo in the classical picture:  \n- **Fundamentally**: no information is destroyed (fine-grained \u201centropy\u201d is constant).  \n- **Macroscopically**: information about initial conditions becomes scrambled into fine-scale structure that we don\u2019t resolve, so coarse-grained entropy increases.\n\nIf you want to be blunt: *entropy increase is about ignorance under coarse observation, not about microphysical amnesia*.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Quantum closed systems: unitarity and entanglement\n\nIn (standard) quantum mechanics for an isolated system:\n\n- Time evolution is unitary: \\(\\rho(t) = U(t)\\rho(0)U^\\dagger(t)\\).\n- Unitary evolution preserves eigenvalues of \\(\\rho\\), hence **preserves von Neumann entropy**:\n  \\[\n  S(\\rho(t)) = S(\\rho(0))\n  \\]\n- For a closed system starting in a pure state: \\(S(\\rho) = 0\\) for all times.\n\nSo at the level of the **entire closed system**, quantum information is conserved: no loss of information.\n\nHowever, something subtle happens for **subsystems**:\n\n- Consider a closed system \\(A \\cup B\\) in a pure state.  \n- The reduced state of subsystem \\(A\\), \\(\\rho_A = \\mathrm{Tr}_B(\\rho)\\), typically develops **entanglement** with \\(B\\).  \n- The von Neumann entropy \\(S(\\rho_A)\\) can increase over time, even though the total entropy of \\(AB\\) remains zero.\n\nThis is the quantum analogue of coarse-graining:\n\n- You, as a local observer, only access some degrees of freedom (e.g. the gas, not the environment).\n- The rest of the universe acts as an \u201cenvironment\u201d that entangles with your subsystem.\n- From your point of view, information is \u201clost\u201d into correlations with the environment. Globally, it\u2019s still there in the full wavefunction.\n\nSo again:\n\n- **Globally** (perfect knowledge, full access): information is conserved, entropy does not increase.\n- **Locally** (realistic observers, limited access): entropy increases because information is pushed into correlations and degrees of freedom you don\u2019t control.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The arrow of time and \u201cpractical\u201d information loss\n\nIf information is conserved at the fundamental level, why do we experience an arrow of time with irreversible processes, mixing, and entropy increase?\n\nTwo key ingredients:\n\n1. **Special low-entropy initial condition.**  \n   The early universe had extremely low entropy (in terms of gravitational degrees of freedom etc.). Given that, it is overwhelmingly probable that typical microstates evolve toward macrostates with larger accessible volumes in phase space.\n\n2. **Coarse-graining and typicality.**  \n   For almost any microstate compatible with a low-entropy macrostate, generic evolution leads to states that *macroscopically* look high-entropy. The reverse (milk jumping back into the bottle) requires an exponentially fine-tuned microstate. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t see entropy spontaneously decrease.\n\nSo entropy increase is essentially: \u201cGiven a very special beginning, and given that we only see macroscopic variables, the overwhelming statistical trend is toward less recoverable macroscopic information.\u201d\n\nIn practice, **once information has diffused into microscopic details and high-order correlations, it is for all realistic purposes gone.** Recovering it would require control and measurement of absurdly many degrees of freedom with impossible precision.\n\n\u201cDestroyed for all practical purposes\u201d \u2260 \u201cdestroyed in principle.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5. What about black holes and genuine information loss?\n\nThe **black hole information paradox** arises because Hawking\u2019s original semiclassical calculation suggested:\n\n- Black holes evaporate via thermal radiation.\n- The outgoing radiation looks purely thermal \u2192 seems to carry no detailed information about what fell in.\n- A pure state collapsing into a black hole then evaporating would apparently evolve into a mixed state \u2192 non-unitary evolution \u2192 real information destruction.\n\nThat *would* be a case where entropy increase corresponds to true loss of information in a closed system, violating the usual story above.\n\nBut:\n\n- Modern work (AdS/CFT correspondence, quantum extremal surfaces, Page curve calculations) strongly points toward **unitary evolution** being preserved and no fundamental information destruction.\n- The \u201cinformation\u201d is thought to be encoded in extremely subtle correlations in the Hawking radiation.\n\nSo current mainstream view: **even black holes do not destroy information**, though the microscopic mechanism is still under active research.\n\n---\n\n## 6. So, is information destroyed as entropy increases?\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- In **classical Hamiltonian mechanics** for a closed system:  \n  \u2013 Fine-grained information is conserved (Liouville).  \n  \u2013 Entropy increase is due to coarse-graining and our limited description.\n\n- In **quantum mechanics** for a closed system with unitary evolution:  \n  \u2013 Global von Neumann entropy is conserved; information is not destroyed.  \n  \u2013 Subsystem entropies increase because information flows into entanglement and correlations with unobserved degrees of freedom.\n\n- In **realistic thermodynamic processes**:  \n  \u2013 Information about microdetails becomes effectively unrecoverable, even though not strictly annihilated.  \n  \u2013 Entropy increase is best understood as the growth of *inaccessible* or *ignored* information.\n\nOnly if the fundamental dynamics were non-unitary (e.g. certain collapse models, or a truly non-unitary quantum gravity theory) would entropy increase entail genuine information destruction. Our best frameworks so far do **not** require that.\n\nSo the precise answer:\n\n> **No, not in our standard physical theories. As entropy increases in a closed system, information is not fundamentally destroyed; it is scrambled into microscopic degrees of freedom and correlations, becoming practically but not fundamentally lost.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"3e38236f-fa36-431f-bf95-8e0ea54717b6","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"3a43e23b-b179-48dd-8da1-2c47cedc9417","turn_exchange_id":"f6176b19-86af-4d61-b563-dd77529188c2","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"3a43e23b-b179-48dd-8da1-2c47cedc9417","children":["e089decf-eb85-45f3-b662-283304d1f801"]},"e089decf-eb85-45f3-b662-283304d1f801":{"id":"e089decf-eb85-45f3-b662-283304d1f801","message":{"id":"e089decf-eb85-45f3-b662-283304d1f801","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763997416.776,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Due to the uncertainty principle the exact microstate cannot be determined?

Classical picture vs quantum picture\n\nIn the **classical** story I sketched earlier:\n\n- A microstate **is** a point \\((q,p)\\) in phase space.\n- Hamiltonian flow is invertible and volume-preserving \u2192 Liouville theorem.\n- A probability density \\(f(q,p,t)\\) on phase space is *our* ignorance about which point we are actually in.\n\nIn that classical world you *can* in principle talk about \u201cthe exact microstate\u201d as a delta at a point in phase space.\n\nIn the **quantum** world:\n\n- You cannot assign simultaneously sharp values of \\(q\\) and \\(p\\) to a system (for each degree of freedom):\n  \\[\n  \\Delta q \\, \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.\n  \\]\n- There is no physical state that corresponds to a phase-space delta \\(\\delta(q-q_0)\\delta(p-p_0)\\). Any physical state occupies a blob in phase space of area at least \\(\\sim \\hbar\\) (per degree of freedom).\n\nSo: **yes**, if by \u201cmicrostate\u201d you literally mean \u201cexact point in classical phase space\u201d, then *in the actual quantum world* such an object is not a physically allowable state and cannot be determined or even exist.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t quite mean \u201cthe true state is a probability distribution over phase-space points\u201d in the classical sense; that\u2019s too naive for quantum mechanics.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What replaces \u201cpoint in phase space\u201d in quantum mechanics?\n\nThe clean replacement is:\n\n- The **microstate** of a closed quantum system is a **pure state**: a ray \\([\\psi]\\) in Hilbert space, or equivalently a rank-1 projector \\(\\rho = |\\psi\\rangle\\!\\langle\\psi|\\).\n- More generally, you have a **density operator** \\(\\rho\\), which already incorporates classical uncertainty and/or entanglement with an environment.\n\nUncertainty principle then says:\n\n- Even if the system is in a pure state \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\), there is no assignment of sharp values to non-commuting observables like \\(Q\\) and \\(P\\).  \n- The state is not a point in phase space; it is a vector in Hilbert space (or a density matrix on that space).  \n- What we can talk about operationally is the probability distribution of measurement outcomes implied by \\(\\rho\\).\n\nSo quantum mechanically:\n\n- **Exact microstate** = exact \\(\\rho\\) (for a closed system, often a pure state).\n- Our **epistemic state** = maybe a probability distribution over possible \\(\\rho\\)\u2019s, *on top of* the intrinsic quantum probabilities encoded in each \\(\\rho\\).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Phase space formulations of quantum mechanics\n\nThere *is* a phase-space language for quantum mechanics, but it\u2019s not a na\u00efve probability distribution:\n\n- The **Wigner function** \\(W(q,p)\\) is a quasi-probability distribution on phase space. It reproduces the correct marginals for \\(q\\) and \\(p\\), but can take negative values.\n- You can also use the Husimi \\(Q\\)-function (Gaussian-smeared Wigner function), which is always non-negative but is irreducibly smeared over cells of area \\(\\sim \\hbar\\).\n\nThese objects obey a quantum analogue of Liouville\u2019s equation (with the Moyal bracket in place of the Poisson bracket), but the non-commutativity shows up as:\n\n- No state localized on a point in phase space.\n- Minimum \u201ccell\u201d in phase space of size \\(\\sim (2\\pi\\hbar)^N\\) for \\(N\\) degrees of freedom.\n- Non-classical features (like negativity of Wigner function).\n\nSo you *can* work with a phase-space \u201cdistribution\u201d, but it\u2019s not a classical probability distribution in the Kolmogorov sense.\n\n---\n\n### 4. How this connects back to entropy and information\n\nFor a **closed quantum system**:\n\n- Time evolution is unitary: \\(\\rho(t) = U(t)\\rho(0)U^\\dagger(t)\\).\n- The **von Neumann entropy** \\(S(\\rho) = -\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho\\log \\rho)\\) is invariant under this evolution.\n- If \\(\\rho = |\\psi\\rangle\\!\\langle\\psi|\\) is pure, then \\(S(\\rho) = 0\\) for all times.\n\nSo at the fundamental level:\n\n- There *is* an \u201cexact microstate\u201d: the pure state (or density operator) of the closed system.\n- This microstate evolves reversibly; information is not destroyed.\n- The uncertainty principle limits which sets of observables can be sharply specified, but it does **not** mean \u201cthere is no exact state\u201d; it means \u201cno exact joint assignment of eigenvalues to all non-commuting observables.\u201d\n\nWhen we talk about entropy increase in **statistical mechanics**:\n\n- Classically, we often talk about probability densities on phase space.\n- Quantum mechanically, the basic object is a **density matrix** (or equivalently, a quasi-distribution like Wigner\u2019s).\n- Entropy increase is then the increase of:\n  - coarse-grained entropy in classical stat-mech, or\n  - entropy of reduced density matrices for subsystems (entanglement entropy, thermodynamic entropy) in quantum mechanics.\n\nIn both cases, what\u2019s really happening is:\n\n> We move from a description where the exact microstate (point in phase space / pure state in Hilbert space) is assumed to evolve reversibly, to a description where we only keep some coarse or local information \u2192 entropy increases as the ignored information gets pushed into fine-scale structure or entanglement.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Direct answer to your question\n\nSo to answer your two sentences explicitly:\n\n> **\u201cDue to the uncertainty principle the exact microstate cannot be determined?\u201d**\n\n- If by \u201cmicrostate\u201d you mean \u201csimultaneously sharp values of all canonical coordinates and momenta\u201d, then:  \n  **Yes** \u2013 such a state doesn\u2019t exist in quantum mechanics, so it certainly can\u2019t be determined.\n- If by \u201cmicrostate\u201d you mean \u201cthe exact quantum state \\(\\rho\\) of the closed system\u201d, then:  \n  **No** \u2013 the theory assigns such a state and evolves it unitarily. In principle it is well-defined, though in practice you can\u2019t fully reconstruct it for a macroscopic system.\n\n> **\u201cRather we need to talk about the probability distribution over the phase space?\u201d**\n\n- In a fully quantum treatment, the natural object is a **density operator** \\(\\rho\\), or equivalently something like the **Wigner function**, which is a quasi-probability on phase space.\n- So conceptually: replace \u201cprobability distribution on phase space\u201d by \u201cdensity matrix\u201d (or its phase-space representation) as the fundamental carrier of information.\n- In the classical limit (large action scales, coarse observables), that reduces to an honest probability distribution on phase space evolving under classical Liouville dynamics.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can take one concrete example (say, a single harmonic oscillator) and explicitly compare:\n\n- classical phase-space flow and fine-/coarse-grained entropy, vs  \n- the quantum evolution of Wigner and von Neumann entropies."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"a75a07f7-c2dd-4d43-9c6d-cd9585fcd487","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"1883bf36-9e77-4d70-bfff-a51207759535","turn_exchange_id":"865e5a8e-c5da-4de5-a021-a56a00c095b9","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"1883bf36-9e77-4d70-bfff-a51207759535","children":[]}}}
