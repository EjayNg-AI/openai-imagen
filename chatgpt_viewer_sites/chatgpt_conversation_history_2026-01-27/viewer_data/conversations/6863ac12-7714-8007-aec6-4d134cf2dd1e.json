From roughly **$270/oz in 2000** to over **$2,000/oz in recent years**, gold\u2019s price has increased by about **1,000%**, compared to roughly **330%** for the S&P\u00a0500 over the same period\u301060\u2020L449-L456\u3011. This long-term surge reflects several cycles: gold was relatively flat in the late 1990s, then entered a **bull market in the 2000s**, peaked in 2011, endured a **bear phase 2012\u20132015**, and resumed an uptrend to new highs by 2020\u20132021. Major **macroeconomic themes** drove these moves. In the 2000s, a weak dollar, rising commodity demand, and low real interest rates lifted gold alongside other commodities. Gold spiked to an all-time high in **2011 (~$1,900/oz)** amid **quantitative easing (QE)** and **inflation fears** following the 2008 crisis. Subsequently, as the economy recovered and the Federal Reserve signaled tighter policy (the 2013 \u201ctaper\u201d of QE), gold entered a multi-year downturn\u301027\u2020L396-L404\u3011. By late 2015, gold bottomed near ~$1,050, then slowly climbed as global monetary policy stayed accommodative. **Geopolitical events** (e.g. the 2010\u20132012 Eurozone crisis, 2014 Crimea tensions, etc.) periodically boosted safe-haven demand. In 2020, **COVID-19 turmoil** and unprecedented central bank stimulus propelled gold to new nominal highs (~$2,075 in August 2020\u301027\u2020L339-L348\u3011). Gold remained strong through 2021\u20132023 amid **high inflation** and bouts of financial uncertainty (e.g. the 2022 Ukraine war and recession fears). Overall, gold\u2019s trajectory since 2000 reflects its dual nature as a **commodities-driven asset** (rising with liquidity and inflation) and an **investor safe haven** (spiking during crises). \n\n## Correlation Between Gold and Equities: Overview  \nAlthough gold and stock indices (like the S&P\u00a0500 and NASDAQ) are very different assets, their relationship is *not fixed* \u2013 the correlation has fluctuated markedly over time. **Over the long run, gold\u2019s correlation with equities tends to be low (near zero)**; one analysis finds gold\u2019s **average 1-year correlation with stocks is only ~0.08** (essentially uncorrelated)\u301058\u2020L128-L136\u3011. This makes gold attractive for diversification, as emphasized by investors like Ray Dalio (who called diversification the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of investing)\u30102\u2020L155-L163\u3011. However, long-term averages mask **distinct periods of positive, negative, and negligible correlation**. Gold is *famously a counter-cyclical \u201csafe haven\u201d* \u2013 often **negatively correlated with stocks during market stress**, when investors flock to gold as stocks fall\u301023\u2020L181-L189\u3011\u301058\u2020L132-L139\u3011. Conversely, at other times gold has risen in tandem with equities (positive correlation), especially when abundant **liquidity** or **low interest rates** buoy all asset prices. The correlation also spends significant time near zero when gold and stocks move on separate drivers (e.g. gold reacting to currency or inflation trends while equities follow earnings growth). The chart below illustrates this variability, showing gold\u2019s price versus the S&P\u00a0500 and their rolling 1-year correlation over the decades:\n\n\u301059\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Gold vs. the stock market:* The orange line shows the 1-year rolling correlation coefficient between gold and the S&P\u00a0500 (left scale), oscillating between positive and negative regimes. Gold\u2019s price (blue, log scale) and the S&P\u00a0500 index (green) are also plotted\u301059\u2020L0-L0\u3011. On average the correlation is near zero, but distinct spikes and dips align with economic cycles (e.g. strongly **negative in 2008\u20132009**, strongly **positive in 2010\u20132011** and again in **2023\u20132024**).\n\nBelow, we **identify key periods** since 2000 characterized by **positive, negative, or low correlation** between gold and U.S. equity indices, and explain the macroeconomic drivers behind these regimes. For each period, factors like **money flows and market liquidity**, **central bank policies**, **interest rate changes**, **inflation dynamics**, **geopolitical shocks**, and **economic cycle stage** help explain why gold and stocks moved together \u2013 or in opposite directions.\n\n## Periods of Negative Correlation (Gold \u2197 vs. Stocks \u2198)  \nCertain crisis or transition periods saw **gold rising while stock markets fell**, resulting in **negative correlation**. In these episodes, **risk aversion and safe-haven flows** into gold were the dominant theme:\n\n- **2000\u20132002: Tech Bust and Safe-Haven Flows.** After the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the NASDAQ and S&P\u00a0500 tumbled into a deep bear market (the S&P\u00a0500 fell roughly 37% over 2000\u20132002). Gold, however, began to attract safe-haven demand. Notably in **2002\u2019s mild recession, stocks fell ~24% while gold rose ~11%**, showcasing gold\u2019s value as a store of value during equity turmoil\u301050\u2020L38-L42\u3011. The early-2000s environment featured Fed rate cuts and a weakening U.S. dollar, which also bolstered gold. **Money flowed out of overvalued tech stocks and into defensive assets** like gold, driving a **negative correlation** (gold up, equities down). \n\n- **2008\u20132009: Global Financial Crisis.** The late-2007 to early-2009 period saw one of the strongest inverse relationships between gold and stocks. As the **2008 financial crisis** unfolded, equity markets **cratered** (the S&P\u00a0500 lost ~38% in 2008), while investors flocked to gold. **Gold\u2019s price surged** \u2013 it *gained nearly 24% in 2009* (and ended 2008 slightly up as well)\u301030\u2020L361-L368\u3011. Initially, during the **panic of late 2008**, gold was briefly sold off alongside stocks (investors liquidated gold to raise cash during the liquidity crunch). But as central banks injected liquidity and fear of banking collapse set in, **gold\u2019s safe-haven appeal dominated**, and it rallied strongly even as stocks languished. **Market liquidity and central bank policy** were crucial: the Fed\u2019s massive QE and zero-rate policy stoked **inflation expectations and currency debasement fears**, which further boosted gold into 2010\u20132011. The net result was a pronounced **negative correlation** during the worst of the crisis \u2013 **when stocks plunged, gold soared**\u301030\u2020L361-L368\u3011\u301058\u2020L132-L139\u3011. \n\n- **2012\u20132015: Post-Crisis Divergence (Gold Down, Stocks Up).** In the aftermath of the financial crisis, **correlation flipped negative again** but in the opposite direction: this time **stocks surged while gold slumped**. The S&P\u00a0500 entered a robust bull market (roughly +60% from 2012 through 2015), fueled by economic recovery and ample liquidity. Gold, meanwhile, **fell sharply** from its 2011 peak. From late 2012 to 2015 gold lost over **25\u201335% of its value**\u301027\u2020L381-L388\u3011, declining to ~$1,050 by end-2015. Several macro factors drove this divergence: the Fed began **signaling an end to QE and eventual rate hikes (the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d)**, **inflation remained low**, and investors chased higher returns in risk assets (stocks) rather than \u201cinert\u201d gold\u301027\u2020L396-L404\u3011. Gold\u2019s traditional appeal waned as **real interest rates rose** and the stock market delivered strong gains \u2013 exemplifying a **negative correlation** regime (gold down, equities up). As one analysis noted, the Fed\u2019s wrap-up of stimulus and **\u201cred-hot stock market\u201d** in 2013 made sitting in gold less appealing\u301027\u2020L396-L404\u3011. In short, **improving economic cycle and tighter monetary policy** shifted money out of gold and into equities.\n\n- **Early 2022: Inflation and War Create Inverse Moves.** The first half of 2022 was marked by **surging inflation** (a 40-year high in the U.S.) and the shock of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. These forces hit stocks hard \u2013 the S&P\u00a0500 fell into bear market territory by mid-2022 \u2013 while **gold spiked**. In Q1 2022, as the Ukraine war escalated and CPI inflation topped 8%, gold briefly reached a record nominal high (~$2,070 in March). **Stocks and gold moved opposite:** equities sold off sharply while gold gained roughly 5% in that first quarter (a negative correlation) as investors sought hedges for geopolitical and inflation risks. However, as **central banks tightened aggressively** (the Fed\u2019s rapid rate hikes to tame inflation), both assets weakened later in 2022. By the end of the defined \u201c2022 plunge\u201d (Jan\u2013Oct 2022), gold had given back some gains (down ~7.9% over that span) but still **outperformed stocks** (global equities down ~22.9%)\u301058\u2020L137-L146\u3011. In that sense gold *acted as a safe haven* \u2013 mitigating losses \u2013 though it did not rise as it did in 2008. Overall, **through mid-2022, correlation was negative**: **high inflation and war drove gold up while stocks fell**, until rate hikes eventually pressured both.\n\n**Macro Drivers of Negative Correlation:** Across these periods, a common pattern is **\u201cflight to safety\u201d** versus **\u201crisk-off\u201d** in equities. When **market liquidity collapses or risk appetite evaporates**, gold benefits from **money flows out of stocks**. Central bank policies that **raise interest rates or curtail liquidity** (e.g. Fed tightening in 2013 and 2022) often hurt stocks *and* can initially hurt gold \u2013 but if inflation or crisis fears dominate, gold may still rise as a safe haven despite higher rates. **Geopolitical and economic shocks** (recession, war, default fears) tend to produce negative gold-stock correlation as well, with gold rising on fear. In sum, negative correlation regimes tend to coincide with **economic downturns or shocks** where gold\u2019s role as *alternative money* and *store of value* shines.\n\n## Periods of Positive Correlation (Gold \u2197 and Stocks \u2197)  \nIn other periods, **gold and equities have moved in the same direction**, yielding **positive correlation**. These are often times of **broad market optimism or abundant liquidity**, when **\u201ca rising tide lifts all boats\u201d** \u2013 both risky and safe assets rally (albeit for different reasons):\n\n- **2003\u20132007: Synchronized Expansion.** After the early-2000s recession, the **mid-2000s economic expansion** saw **stocks and gold climb together**. The S&P\u00a0500 rose strongly (nearly doubling from its 2002 lows by 2007), and gold surged from the low $300s/oz to ~$800/oz over the same period. Correlation was **positive**, as both responded to **ample liquidity and growth**. Key drivers: the Fed kept interest rates relatively low for much of the early 2000s, **credit flowed easily**, and a **commodities boom** (fueled by emerging markets like China) lifted gold alongside other raw materials. The U.S. dollar was also weakening in this period, which bolstered gold. Thus, **market liquidity and inflationary pressures** (oil hit record highs by 2007) meant **gold rose on inflation hedging and commodity demand, while stocks rose on economic growth** \u2013 a rare **win-win scenario** for both. Correlation was not perfect (gold had pullbacks even as stocks rose), but overall the trend was **both asset classes trending up**, unlike the inverse moves of 2000\u201302. \n\n- **2009\u20132011: Liquidity-Fueled Rally.** Coming out of the financial crisis, **2009\u20132011** featured an unusual period where **gold and equities both soared**, yielding **positive correlation**. Massive monetary stimulus (zero interest rates and multi-trillion-dollar QE programs) and fiscal stimulus revived the stock market **(the S&P\u00a0500 gained ~95% from March 2009 to mid-2011)**. At the same time, these policies stoked inflation expectations and concern about currency debasement, driving **gold up ~150%** from ~$800 in 2009 to ~$1,900 by late 2011\u301027\u2020L375-L383\u3011. **Central bank liquidity was the common fuel**: with money supply surging, **market liquidity lifted all assets**. Both gold and stocks were *\u201cjoined at the hip\u201d* in this period \u2013 in fact, by 2010 the **1-year correlation turned strongly positive (approaching +0.9)**, one of the highest ever\u301023\u2020L195-L203\u3011\u301023\u2020L202-L210\u3011. Investors were simultaneously confident in **economic recovery** (boosting stocks) *and* fearful of **inflation and currency risks** (boosting gold). The result was a **rare alignment** where **risk assets and safe-haven assets rose in tandem**, underpinned by **easy-money conditions**. Observers noted this was the most positive gold-stock correlation since at least the early 1980s\u301023\u2020L197-L205\u3011. It illustrates how **extreme monetary easing** can blur the usual inverse relationship \u2013 gold acted not just as a crisis hedge but also as an **inflation trade**, rallying alongside a reflating economy.\n\n- **2016\u20132019: Late-Cycle Mild Correlation.** In the late 2010s, correlation was lower than in the QE era, but generally **mildly positive** as **both gold and stocks drifted upward**. The S&P\u00a0500 saw steady gains (with some volatility) thanks to solid economic growth and low unemployment, while gold gradually rose from ~$1,050 (end-2015) to ~$1,500 by 2019. **Central banks remained accommodative** \u2013 even as the Fed raised rates off zero (2016\u20132018), policy was still relatively loose globally, and by 2019 the Fed pivoted back to rate cuts. This period lacked major inflation or crisis, so gold\u2019s moves were driven by **moderate safe-haven demand (e.g. during 2018 trade war jitters)** and **portfolio allocation trends**. Stocks benefitted from tax cuts (2018) and robust earnings. There were moments of negative correlation \u2013 for example, in the **Feb 2018 and Dec 2018 stock corrections, gold prices firmed while stocks fell** \u2013 but over the multi-year span, both trended up modestly. **Market liquidity and \u201cgoldilocks\u201d conditions** (growth with controlled inflation) allowed a **low-positive correlation** regime. Neither asset faced extreme stress or euphoria \u2013 gold\u2019s correlation hovered near zero to slightly positive. Essentially, **no strong macro disparity** existed to pit gold against stocks. Gold provided diversification but did not consistently move opposite to equities in this stable expansion.\n\n- **2020: Pandemic Stimulus Rally.** The year **2020** encapsulated both extremes, but from April 2020 onward **gold and stocks rallied together** strongly (**positive correlation**). In **March 2020**, the initial COVID shock caused a **liquidity crisis** \u2013 equities *and* gold **plunged in tandem** (correlation briefly turned positive for the wrong reason: everything fell). This was short-lived; by late March, the **Fed slashed rates to zero and launched massive QE**, and Congress passed trillions in stimulus. The result was a **synchronized surge** in asset prices: from April through August 2020, **stocks rebounded sharply** (the S&P fully erased its 35% crash) *while* **gold skyrocketed** to new highs (hitting $2,075 by Aug\u00a02020\u301027\u2020L339-L348\u3011). Both were responding to **unprecedented liquidity and \u201cmoney printing\u201d**, plus expectations of inflation and recovery. During that phase, correlation was **positively elevated** \u2013 one-month correlations spiked as both markets were trending up together. (Notably, a **12-month correlation reached ~+0.9 by late 2020**, comparable to the 2010 high\u301023\u2020L203-L210\u3011.) Later in 2020, the pattern shifted: news of vaccines and rising bond yields in late 2020 caused **gold to pull back** even as stocks continued higher, briefly flipping correlation negative. But during the **core of 2020\u2019s stimulus-fueled rally**, **easy liquidity meant all asset classes inflated together**, a hallmark of **positive correlation under high liquidity**. \n\n- **2023\u20132024: Rate Peak Optimism.** Most recently, **2023 into 2024** saw gold and equities **rising in unison** again. As inflation showed signs of peaking and the Federal Reserve approached the end of its rate-hike cycle, markets began **anticipating rate cuts and easier policy ahead**. This **\u201cFed pivot\u201d optimism** boosted **stock indices (especially the NASDAQ, which surged in 2023 on tech enthusiasm)**, and also supported **gold** (which benefits from lower real yields and dollar softness when the Fed eases). By late 2023, **both the S&P\u00a0500 and gold were near multi-year or record highs**. This produced an unusually **high positive correlation**. In fact, in September 2024 analysts noted the gold-stock correlation (on a 12-month basis) was in the **top 1% of all readings in the past 50 years**\u301023\u2020L203-L211\u3011 \u2013 a stark contrast to gold\u2019s typical independence. On shorter time frames it was even more extreme: in early September 2024, the **1-month correlation hit +0.94**, the strongest since 1982\u301023\u2020L193-L201\u3011. The **macro rationale** was that **both markets were pricing in easier financial conditions** (rate cuts) and **abundant liquidity** returning. **Investor money flows** favored *both* asset classes \u2013 stocks on improved risk sentiment, and gold on expectations of falling rates and possibly as an inflation hedge if cuts reignite price increases. This period underscores that when **monetary policy shifts toward easing**, it can create a **unified rally** across diverse assets. (However, such high correlation is often short-lived; by late 2024 it began to normalize as gold and stock trajectories diverged slightly\u301023\u2020L209-L218\u3011.)\n\n**Macro Drivers of Positive Correlation:** Positive correlation regimes often occur when **monetary policy is extremely accommodative**, providing **excess liquidity** that drives *both* risk assets and inflation hedges upward. During these times, **interest rates are low or falling**, which **reduces the opportunity cost of holding gold** (since yields on bonds/cash are low) and simultaneously **stimulates economic growth** (boosting equities). For example, the **zero-rate, QE environment** of 2009\u20132011 and 2020\u20132021 created *joint rallies*. In addition, **broad inflationary booms** (like the mid-2000s commodity surge) can see **stocks rising on growth while gold rises on inflation**, yielding positive correlation. It\u2019s important to note that **positive correlation doesn\u2019t necessarily mean equal performance** \u2013 one asset may far outperform (e.g. in 2020 gold gained ~25% while the S&P\u00a0500 gained ~16%\u301027\u2020L339-L348\u3011, and in 2021 stocks rose ~27% while gold dipped). But the **directional trend** is shared. These periods tend to coincide with the **expansion phase of the economic cycle or early recovery**, when **confidence is improving and liquidity is ample**. They can also occur when **investors expect future easing** (as in 2023), effectively \u201cpricing in\u201d a friendly environment for both gold and stocks. \n\n## Periods of Low or Neutral Correlation  \nThere have also been stretches where **gold and the stock market show little clear correlation**, with movements largely independent. Such **low-correlation periods** often happen when each asset is driven by different, unrelated forces. For example, in **stable economic periods without crises or central bank surprises**, gold may trade in a range (perhaps responding to currency fluctuations or jewelry demand), while stocks rise steadily with earnings \u2013 their paths neither strongly align nor oppose. The **mid-2010s (2014\u20132016)** is one such case: gold was bottoming out and then flat-to-up slightly, while equities ground higher, resulting in rolling correlations near zero. **2017** similarly saw low correlation \u2013 stocks rallied strongly with synchronized global growth, whereas gold had a modest uptick (supported by a weak dollar) but not an inverse relationship to stocks. These neutral stretches highlight gold\u2019s role as an **idiosyncratic asset**: sometimes its price is more influenced by factors like **central-bank gold purchases, currency movements (USD strength/weakness), or mining supply trends**, which don\u2019t have much to do with stock market drivers (corporate profits, etc.). \n\nAnother neutral example is parts of **2018\u20132019**: at times, gold and stocks both rose (mild positive correlation), but during other months they diverged (brief safe-haven flows to gold during stock volatility, then converging again), averaging out to a low overall correlation. Over such multi-year spans, the correlation coefficient might hover around zero \u2013 meaning **holding gold provided diversification without consistently hurting or helping stock performance**. In fact, the long-run near-zero average correlation indicates that **most of the time gold neither rises nor falls in lockstep with equities**\u301058\u2020L128-L136\u3011. This reinforces why gold is considered a valuable diversifier in a portfolio: in **normal times** it has its *own cycle*, and in **abnormal times** it often *hedges equity risk by moving opposite*. But there are also times it joins the party with stocks \u2013 hence one must evaluate correlation in context of the prevailing macro forces.\n\n## Explaining Shifts in Correlation  \nBringing the analysis together, shifts in gold-stock correlation can be understood via **macroeconomic indicators and themes**:\n\n- **Market Crises & Liquidity:** During acute crises (2001, 2008, 2020 initial phase), correlations can **spike positive briefly** (everything falls together in a liquidity crunch\u301058\u2020L101-L110\u3011) but then typically turn **deeply negative as gold decouples and rises** while stocks remain down. **Market liquidity injections** (or lack thereof) are critical \u2013 when central banks inject liquidity (2009, 2020), it can flip previously negative correlations to positive by lifting all assets.\n\n- **Monetary Policy & Interest Rates:** **Central bank policy is a key driver of regime shifts.** Easing policy (rate cuts, QE) tends to **reduce gold\u2019s inverse relationship** with stocks \u2013 gold benefits from low rates just as stocks do, often creating positive correlation\u301023\u2020L185-L193\u3011\u301023\u2020L195-L203\u3011. Conversely, tightening policy (rate hikes, tapering QE) often **pressures both stocks and gold initially**; however, stocks may suffer from growth concerns while gold eventually benefits if inflation remains high or yields peak. For instance, the **prospect of higher real interest rates** in 2013 and 2021 saw gold underperform while stocks (initially) continued rising, fostering negative correlation\u301027\u2020L396-L404\u3011\u301057\u2020L29-L37\u3011. Thus, the **interest-rate cycle** often explains correlation shifts: e.g. **rising rates in 2021** hurt gold (increasing its opportunity cost) even as stocks rallied on reopening optimism, whereas **falling rates in 2023\u20132024** helped both.\n\n- **Inflation and Economic Cycle:** **Inflation trends** influence the gold-stock relationship in complex ways. Moderate inflation in a growth phase is stock-friendly and may not lift gold much (low correlation). But **high or rising inflation (especially above central bank targets)** tends to **boost gold** (as an inflation hedge) and can hurt stocks (via margin pressures and tighter policy), producing **negative correlation**. We saw this in early 2022 with spiking inflation (gold up, stocks down). On the other hand, **deflationary recessions or disinflation** can see gold and stocks move together if policy turns stimulative (e.g. 2009\u2019s reflation). The **broader economic cycle** matters too: in **late-cycle periods** when growth is slowing and inflation rising (stagflation risk), gold often shines relative to stocks (negative correlation), whereas in **early-cycle recoveries** both can rise (positive correlation). For example, during the **2008 crisis (a deflationary shock)** gold and stocks diverged (negative correlation)\u301030\u2020L361-L368\u3011, but in the **2020 recovery (reflation)** they converged (positive). \n\n- **Geopolitical and Risk Sentiment:** **Geopolitical shocks** (terror attacks, wars, political instability) usually spur **safe-haven flows to gold and risk aversion in equities**, driving short-term **negative correlation**. The 2001 terrorist attacks, the 2022 Ukraine war, etc., fit this pattern. Periods of **high volatility or credit stress** will see gold benefit (as seen in the 2002 and 2008 examples\u301050\u2020L38-L42\u3011\u301058\u2020L132-L139\u3011). In contrast, **extremely bullish investor sentiment** or **asset bubbles** can lead to both gold and equities rising \u2013 gold sometimes gets bid up alongside other assets (until a crash corrects one or both). We saw some of this **\u201ceverything rally\u201d** dynamic in 2020\u20132021 when sentiment was buoyant across markets.\n\n- **Money Flows & Market Structure:** The role of large institutional flows and central bank purchases can also affect correlation. For instance, **central banks buying gold (e.g. record purchases in 2022\u20132023)** provided independent support to gold that had little to do with stock performance, sometimes muting correlation. On the flip side, when **investors rotate portfolios** (e.g. out of stocks into gold or vice versa), it directly creates negative correlation. A clear example is 2013: as stocks ran up, some investors dumped gold holdings (gold ETFs saw outflows) to reallocate into equities, enforcing the negative linkage. **Global liquidity conditions** (strong USD vs weak USD) also matter: a *weak dollar* tends to lift both U.S. stocks (via better exports/earnings) and dollar-priced gold, whereas a *strong dollar* can pressure both \u2013 these scenarios produce positive correlation spurts driven by currency and liquidity.\n\nIn **summary**, gold\u2019s correlation with the S&P\u00a0500 and NASDAQ has swung from strongly negative to strongly positive at different times since 2000, mirroring shifts in the macro environment:\n\n- **Negative correlation** dominated **bear markets and crises** \u2013 gold acting as a hedge when equities faltered (e.g. 2002, 2008, 2022)\u301050\u2020L38-L42\u3011\u301030\u2020L361-L368\u3011. Key causes: **risk-off sentiment, recession fears, financial stress, and inflation hedging during stagflation threats**.\n\n- **Positive correlation** emerged during **liquidity-driven booms or recoveries** \u2013 gold rising alongside stocks when policy was ultra-loose or growth/inflation were picking up together (e.g. mid-2000s expansion, post-2009 QE rebound, and the 2020\u20132021 stimulus period)\u301023\u2020L197-L205\u3011\u301058\u2020L132-L139\u3011. Key causes: **low interest rates, abundant money supply, and synchronized economic optimism**.\n\n- **Low correlation** prevailed in **stable mid-cycle periods** where each asset responded to its own fundamentals \u2013 neither severe risk aversion nor speculative mania was prevalent. In such times, gold\u2019s role as a **diversifier** is most evident, contributing to portfolio stability without a strong positive or negative tie to equities\u301058\u2020L128-L136\u3011.\n\nInvestors and analysts can thus **link correlation regime shifts to macro indicators**. For example, tracking **real interest rates** (which combine nominal rates and inflation) is especially informative: gold typically has an inverse relationship to real yields. When real rates fall (or are deeply negative), gold and stocks may both rise (as in 2020); when real rates spike higher, gold falls even if stocks have remained buoyant (as in 2013 and early 2021)\u301057\u2020L29-L37\u3011. **Central bank stance, inflation momentum, and risk metrics (like the VIX volatility index)** all provide clues to whether gold will decouple from equities or move in unison. \n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that over this 25-year span gold has indeed delivered **diversification benefits**. Even though there were episodes of positive correlation, gold\u2019s ability to **zig when stocks zag** during severe downturns has been valuable. For instance, during the **worst of the Global Financial Crisis, gold returned over +20% while stocks collapsed ~50% (Sep 2008\u2013Mar 2009)\u301058\u2020L128-L136\u3011\u301058\u2020L132-L139\u3011**, helping portfolios weather the storm. And in the **2022 bear market, gold\u2019s smaller decline (-7.9%) versus stocks (-22.9%) meant a relatively \u201csafe\u201d harbor\u301058\u2020L137-L144\u3011**. Thus, understanding these correlation dynamics and their drivers (from **Fed policy shifts to inflation cycles** to **geopolitical risks**) allows investors to make more informed allocation decisions and to anticipate when gold is likely to diverge from or converge with equity performance. \n\n**Sources:** Historical price and correlation data are from financial databases and studies\u301058\u2020L128-L136\u3011\u301023\u2020L195-L203\u3011.
