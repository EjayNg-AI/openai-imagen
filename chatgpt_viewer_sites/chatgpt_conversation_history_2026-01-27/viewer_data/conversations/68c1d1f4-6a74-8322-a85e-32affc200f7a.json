That happens because your `sanitizeHref()` can\u2019t resolve the relative URLs from `menu.json` when it\u2019s given `location.origin` as the base. Hover still opens the dropdown via CSS, which is why you see the submenu but no redirect. On mobile, you intentionally convert top\u2011level triggers into buttons to toggle submenus, so \u201ctap only reveals sub\u2011menu items\u201d there is by design. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## How we know\n\n1. **Your menu is built at runtime from JSON** (not hard\u2011coded HTML). The page preloads `assets/data/menu.json` and `tuition-js-1.0.2.js`, and the script populates `.nav > ul` on load. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201\n\n2. **The builder chooses `<a>` vs `<button>` based on whether the URL \u201csanitizes.\u201d**  \n   In `renderDesktopMenu(items)`, when a node has children:\n\n   - If `sanitizeHref(node.href)` returns a value \u2192 it builds **`<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"\u2026\">`**.  \n   - Otherwise it falls back to **`<button class=\"nav-link\" type=\"button\">`** (no navigation).  \n   That\u2019s exactly the difference between \u201cclick navigates\u201d vs \u201cclick does nothing.\u201d \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201\n\n3. **Why sanitization fails for perfectly normal relative links.**  \n   Your `sanitizeHref()` does:\n\n   ```js\n   const u = new URL(s, location.origin);\n   ```\n   and returns `null` on failure. Using `location.origin` drops the current path segment; worse, it\u2019s unreliable under `file://` and other non\u2011HTTP origins. In those cases `new URL( \"university-maths.html\", location.origin )` can throw or resolve incorrectly, so `sanitizeHref()` returns `null` \u2192 the builder emits a **`<button>`** instead of an **`<a>`**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201\n\n4. **What you see on desktop is consistent with your CSS/JS.**\n   - CSS opens the dropdown on `:hover`/`:focus-within` (no click required), so hovering works even when the trigger is a button. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201\n   - The desktop script only manages `aria-expanded`/Escape; it never forces navigation. So a button will never redirect. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201\n\n5. **Mobile behaving \u201cbutton\u2011only\u201d is intentional.**  \n   When cloning the desktop menu into the drawer, your code explicitly ensures the trigger is a **`<button>`** (not an `<a>`) so taps toggle the submenu. That\u2019s why \u201cclicking only reveals sub\u2011menu items\u201d on mobile. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201\n\n> Quick confirmation: In DevTools, inspect **University Maths** in the desktop nav. If you see `<button class=\"nav-link\">\u2026</button>` (no `href`), you\u2019ve hit this exact path.\n\n---\n\n## Minimal fix (2 lines) \u2014 make URL resolution robust\n\nUse the **full document URL** as the base for `new URL`, not `location.origin`. That preserves subdirectories and works under `file://` in local dev:\n\n```diff\nfunction sanitizeHref(raw) {\n  if (!raw) return null;\n  const s = String(raw).trim();\n  if (s.startsWith(\"#\")) return s;\n  const lower = s.toLowerCase();\n  if (lower.startsWith(\"javascript:\") || lower.startsWith(\"data:\")) return null;\n  try {\n-   const u = new URL(s, location.origin); // supports relative\n+   const base = document.baseURI || location.href; // robust base\n+   const u = new URL(s, base); // supports relative anywhere\n    if (u.origin === location.origin) return u.href; // same-origin\n    if (ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS.has(u.protocol)) return u.href; // allowed cross-origin schemes\n  } catch (_) {}\n  return null;\n}\n```\n\nDo the same for `sanitizeImgSrc()` (use the same `base`) to keep behavior consistent. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201\n\n**Why this solves it:** with `document.baseURI` (or `location.href`) the relative links in your JSON\u2014e.g. `\"university-maths.html\"`\u2014resolve correctly whether you\u2019re serving from the site root, a subdirectory during staging, or opening the file locally. `sanitizeHref()` will then return a value, so the builder emits an `<a href=\"\u2026\">` and clicking will navigate as expected. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Two additional hardening suggestions\n\n1. **If you intend \u201cContact\u201d to jump to the form on the home page from *any* page**, consider making the JSON explicit and environment\u2011agnostic, e.g. `\"href\": \"index.html#contact\"` (or the full canonical `https://\u2026/index.html#contact`). Right now it is `\"/#contact\"`, which always points to the domain root, not a subfolder during dev. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\n2. **If you want desktop first\u2011click to open the submenu and second click to navigate** (common pattern), add a tiny click handler on desktop anchors to implement \u201cfirst click = open only\u201d and \u201csecond click = follow.\u201d Your current desktop behavior is pure CSS hover/focus, so every anchor click navigates (once the `<a>` is restored). That\u2019s fine; I\u2019m flagging the option in case you want the double\u2011intent pattern. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Sanity checks you can run now\n\nOpen DevTools Console on your page and run:\n\n```js\n[...document.querySelectorAll('.nav .nav-item > .nav-link')].map(el => ({\n  tag: el.tagName,\n  href: el.getAttribute('href')\n}));\n```\n\n- If you see `{ tag: \"BUTTON\", href: null }` for items with children (e.g., University Maths), your `sanitizeHref()` base was the culprit.\n- After the patch, these should be `{ tag: \"A\", href: \"\u2026\" }` for desktop.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nYour code is structurally fine; the **base URL** choice in `sanitizeHref()` is brittle. Switch to `document.baseURI || location.href` (and optionally adjust the one JSON entry for \u201cContact\u201d), and desktop clicks on top\u2011level items will redirect as intended.
