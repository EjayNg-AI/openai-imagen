They have a zero object, and every morphism has a fiber and cofiber, giving rise to a homotopy category that is triangulated\u30101\u2020L2-L4\u3011\u30106\u2020L1-L4\u3011. In essence, stable \u221e-categories provide a \u201ccoordinate-free\u201d setting for homological algebra and homotopy theory: familiar examples include the \u221e-category of spectra in algebraic topology and the derived \u221e-category of a ring or scheme in algebraic geometry\u30107\u2020L619-L627\u3011. By working in this \u221e-categorical language, one gains extra structure (like higher homotopies and coherences) beyond the classical triangulated viewpoint\u30101\u2020L2-L4\u3011. This additional structure has enabled new insights and powerful **universal constructions** in fields ranging from algebraic K-theory to homotopy theory and even theoretical physics.\n\n**Recent trend:** Since 2020, there have been significant advances in both the *foundations* of stable \u221e-category theory and its *applications*. Mathematicians have developed new theoretical tools (e.g. refined K-theory theorems, \u201chermitian\u201d variants with duality, and \u221e-categorical invariants) and applied stable \u221e-categories in innovative ways to solve problems in topology, geometry, and mathematical physics. Below we survey several promising research directions and highlight topics accessible to various levels of researchers \u2013 from hobbyists to Ph.D. students and experts.\n\n## Algebraic K-Theory and Stable \u221e-Categories \nOne of the most impactful uses of stable \u221e-categories has been in **algebraic K-theory**, where they provide a conceptually clear framework for defining and studying K-theoretic invariants. Quillen\u2019s classical K-theory of rings can be rephrased entirely in terms of categories of modules or complexes, and in modern language \u201cK-theory only depends on the stable \u221e-category of perfect complexes\u201d\u30107\u2020L609-L618\u3011. In fact, given a ring or scheme $X$, its algebraic K-theory $K(X)$ can be recovered as the K-theory of the stable \u221e-category of perfect complexes on $X$\u30107\u2020L619-L627\u3011. Similarly, Waldhausen\u2019s $A$-theory of spaces can be seen as K-theory of the \u221e-category of compact spectra over that space\u30107\u2020L619-L627\u3011. This perspective was strongly advocated by Thomason and others and has now become standard\u30107\u2020L611-L618\u3011. \n\n**Foundational advances (post-2020):** Recent work has strengthened the foundational theorems of K-theory in the \u221e-categorical setting. For example, Hebestreit, Lachmann, and Steimle (2023) gave a self-contained \u221e-categorical proof of the **localization theorem** in algebraic K-theory\u30107\u2020L629-L638\u3011\u30107\u2020L637-L645\u3011. In \u221e-category language, this theorem says that any *Verdier quotient* sequence of stable \u221e-categories (i.e. $A\\to B \\to B/A$) yields a fiber sequence of K-theory spectra\u30107\u2020L631-L639\u3011. Their work also revisits the **additivity theorem** and the **cofinality theorem** purely within stable \u221e-category language, avoiding older technical frameworks like Waldhausen categories\u30107\u2020L629-L637\u3011\u30107\u2020L639-L648\u3011. These results solidify that **algebraic $K$-theory can be viewed as a functor** $K: \\mathrm{Cat}_\\infty^{\\mathrm{st}} \\to \\mathrm{Sp}$ from the \u221e-category of small stable \u221e-categories to spectra, satisfying exactness (sending exact sequences of categories to fiber sequences of spectra)\u30107\u2020L637-L645\u3011. The work of Blumberg\u2013Gepner\u2013Tabuada had established that *universal property* (roughly, $K$-theory is the initial such exact functor) a decade ago, and now these theorems have fully \u221e-categorical proofs\u30107\u2020L637-L645\u3011. A takeaway for researchers is that many classical K-theoretic results (Devissage, etc.) are being revisited under this modern lens \u2013 **extending or completing these translations remains an active direction** (Quillen\u2019s devissage theorem is noted as a \u201cnotable exception\u201d still lacking an \u221e-categorical proof\u30107\u2020L629-L637\u3011).\n\n**Hermitian K-theory and Poincar\u00e9 \u221e-categories:** Another breakthrough has been the development of **\u201chermitian $K$-theory\u201d in the \u221e-categorical setting**, spearheaded by Calm\u00e8s, Dotto, Harpaz, Hebestreit, Land, Nikolaus, Steimle, and others. This work introduces *Poincar\u00e9 \u221e-categories* \u2013 stable \u221e-categories equipped with a notion of duality (generalizing symmetric forms on chain complexes) \u2013 to define **Grothendieck\u2013Witt theory (aka hermitian K-theory)** in a flexible new framework\u30107\u2020L665-L673\u3011\u30107\u2020L689-L697\u3011. In classical terms, hermitian $K$-theory incorporates quadratic or symmetric forms (inspired by surgery theory), and the new \u221e-categorical approach allows one to carry out constructions like **Ranicki\u2019s algebraic Thom** and study Lagrangians in chain complexes in a homotopy-coherent way\u30107\u2020L665-L674\u3011\u30107\u2020L689-L697\u3011. The effort resulted in a series of papers (I, II, III) on *Hermitian K-theory for stable \u221e-categories* (with part I covering foundations\u301022\u2020L22-L30\u3011 and later parts establishing additivity and computing concrete GW groups of rings). A highlight is that this provides a *unified, higher-categorical foundation* for the interface of $K$-theory and **L-theory** (surgery theory), opening new questions about manifold invariants. As an example, the notion of **Poincar\u00e9 \u221e-category** in these works yields a robust definition of Lagrangian objects and forms in any stable \u221e-category\u30107\u2020L665-L674\u3011\u30107\u2020L689-L697\u3011, and has already led to proofs of long-standing conjectures (e.g. a form of Gabber\u2019s rigidity in hermitian $K$-theory\u301010\u2020L121-L129\u3011\u301010\u2020L123-L130\u3011). **Research direction:** There remain many avenues for exploration here, such as computing *hermitian K-groups* for new classes of \u221e-categories (especially those coming from geometric or topological data) and studying how hermitian K-theory interacts with classical invariants (e.g. investigating a potential \u201chermitian\u201d analog of the Quillen\u2013Lichtenbaum conjectures, or exploring the role of hermitian K-theory in the classification of high-dimensional manifolds). These projects are suitable for a Ph.D. student with a solid background in algebraic topology and would deepen the connection between homotopy theory and geometric topology.\n\n**Universal \u201cnoncommutative\u201d motives:** A powerful theme in recent research is the idea of **noncommutative motives**, where one treats small stable \u221e-categories as analogues of varieties and studies invariants (like $K$-theory) that only depend on the \u201cmotive\u201d of a category. In 2024, Ramzi, Sosnilo, and Winges proved a striking result: **\u201cEvery motive is the motive of some stable \u221e-category.\u201d** In more concrete terms, they show that the *universal localizing invariant* (which captures invariants like nonconnective $K$-theory) is essentially generated by stable \u221e-categories\u301014\u2020L17-L24\u3011. In fact, **every spectrum (homotopy type) arises as the $K$-theory of some small stable \u221e-category**\u301014\u2020L139-L147\u3011. This resolves a long-standing question by confirming that *any* generalized cohomology theory (spectrum) can be realized as the $K$-theory of a \u201cnoncommutative space\u201d\u301014\u2020L139-L147\u3011. The proof involved constructing a *motivic localization* of the \u221e-category of small stable categories and showing it has the desired universal property\u301014\u2020L17-L24\u3011\u301014\u2020L93-L101\u3011. **Why is this exciting?** It suggests a vast generalization of algebraic geometry: just as every classical motive (\u00e0 la Grothendieck) comes from an actual variety, now every object in the noncommutative motives world comes from an actual category. For researchers, this opens the door to: (1) explicitly constructing **stable \u221e-categories for familiar spectra** (e.g. can we find an intuitive category whose $K$-theory is the Brown\u2013Peterson spectrum, or $\\mathrm{tmf}$, etc.?), and (2) exploring new invariants of categories since any localizing invariant factors through the motivic category\u301014\u2020L17-L24\u3011\u301014\u2020L19-L22\u3011. This area is ripe for contributions \u2013 even hobbyists with programming skills could attempt to *compute K-theory for specific small categories or DG-algebras* to see how \u201cmotives\u201d manifest concretely. On the theoretical side, a Ph.D. project could involve studying the **motivic Eilenberg\u2013MacLane spectrum** (which corresponds to ordinary $K_0$) or verifying how far the analogy between varieties and stable categories goes (for instance, does a form of the Beilinson\u2013Soul\u00e9 vanishing conjecture hold in this realm? Are there \u201cmotivic t-structures\u201d for noncommutative motives, etc.?).\n\n**Analytic and equivariant K-theory:** Stable \u221e-categories have also made inroads into *operator algebras and analytic K-theory*. In recent work (Bunke\u2013Engel, etc.), researchers constructed **stable \u221e-categorical models for Kasparov\u2019s KK-theory** (a bivariant K-theory for $C^*$-algebras)\u301010\u2020L97-L103\u3011. Similarly, Bunke and Duenzinger (2024) showed that **Connes\u2013Higson $E$-theory** (another bivariant K-theory of operator algebras) can be packaged as a *compactly assembled stable \u221e-category*\u301015\u2020L50-L58\u3011. This means deep results in functional analysis are being recast in homotopy-theoretic language, allowing techniques like *shape theory* and \u221e-categorical localization to be applied\u301015\u2020L50-L58\u3011. One outcome is a better understanding of the \u201cenriched\u201d structure of these categories \u2013 for example, the $E$-theory category has a natural topology on its mapping spaces (related to parametrized spectra) which was observed to recover results of Carri\u00f3n\u2013Schafhauser on *noncommutative enrichments*\u301015\u2020L51-L58\u3011. **Future directions:** translating more operator-algebraic invariants into the \u221e-categorical world (e.g. L-theory of $C^*$-algebras\u301010\u2020L119-L127\u3011, or defining new invariants for quantum symmetries via stable categories) is an open avenue. These projects often require a mix of expertise in analysis and homotopy theory, making them ideal for a collaboration or an advanced researcher. However, a motivated newcomer could start with simpler cases (commutative $C^*$-algebras correspond to topological spaces) to build intuition on how topological K-theory and stable categories interact, before moving to the full noncommutative setting.\n\n## Applications in Algebraic Topology and Homotopy Theory \nStable \u221e-categories emerged from algebraic topology (through the \u221e-category of spectra), and they continue to play a central role in modern homotopy theory. Any **spectrum** (generalized cohomology theory) is an object in a stable \u221e-category, and conversely the homotopy theory of spectra is itself a (huge) stable \u221e-category, often denoted $\\mathcal{S}p$. This perspective underlies many recent breakthroughs:\n\n- **Chromatic Homotopy and Localizations:** The language of stable \u221e-categories is crucial in *chromatic homotopy theory*, where one studies spectra through localizations like $E(n)$-local or $K(n)$-local categories. Researchers use \u221e-categorical techniques to analyze **\u201cstable subcategories\u201d** of $\\mathcal{S}p$ (like the thick subcategory generated by a Morava $K$-theory) and prove structural results. For instance, there have been new results on **purity and localization** in algebraic K-theory (Mathew, Meier, Tamme, 2023) analyzing how algebraic $K$-theory behaves after *chromatic localization*\u301010\u2020L113-L121\u3011. Such work leverages the fact that presentable stable \u221e-categories can be tensored and localized, making it feasible to apply *high-tech tools* (like $v_n$-periodicity or motivic filtrations) in a controlled categorical environment. A current research challenge (suitable for an expert or ambitious student) is to further understand **\u201cchromatic redshift\u201d** in K-theory: roughly, how applying higher chromatic localizations affects the $K$-theory of ring spectra (a phenomenon conjectured by Rognes). This requires blending deep homotopy theory with \u221e-categorical $K$-theory \u2013 a cutting-edge topic.\n\n- **Stable \u221e-Categories and Floer Theory:** A very exciting development bridging topology and physics is the creation of a *stable \u221e-categorical* framework for **Floer homotopy theory**. Floer homology (originating in symplectic topology and gauge theory) traditionally produces graded vector spaces; however, Cohen, Jones, Segal and others long hypothesized a richer *stable homotopy type* underlying Floer complexes\u30108\u2020L33-L41\u3011. In 2024, Abouzaid and Blumberg constructed a **stable \u221e-category of \u201cflow categories\u201d** whose morphisms are flow bimodules, capturing the structure of all Floer trajectories\u30108\u2020L5-L12\u3011. In their framework, the moduli spaces of solutions to Floer\u2019s PDEs assemble into a **flow category object**, and **Floer homotopy types arise as *mapping spectra*** in this stable \u221e-category\u30108\u2020L5-L12\u3011. In fact, in a special case (framed flow categories) their \u221e-category model is equivalent to the ordinary stable homotopy category of spectra\u30108\u2020L13-L17\u3011, providing a new bridge between low-dimensional topology and classical stable homotopy\u30108\u2020L13-L17\u3011. This work not only resolves some technical issues in defining Floer homotopy rigorously, but it also **invites new questions**: for example, one could study *spectra invariants of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms* via this category, or extend the construction to other Floer-type theories (instanton Floer homotopy, symplectic field theory, etc.). A Ph.D. student with knowledge in topology and symplectic geometry could make contributions here, perhaps by computing specific Floer homotopy groups or exploring how stable \u221e-categorical flow categories interact with classical operations in homotopy (like cohomology operations or Adams spectral sequences in Floer contexts).\n\n- **Structured Ring Spectra and \u221e-Categories:** Many classical algebraic-topological structures (cohomology rings, $E_\\infty$ ring spectra, operads) have \u221e-categorical incarnations. An \u221e-categorical viewpoint has clarified the **functoriality of complex orientations and elliptic cohomology**. For example, the Goerss\u2013Hopkins\u2013Miller theorem constructs the Morava $E$-theories and $\\mathrm{tmf}$ (topological modular forms) as $E_\\infty$-ring spectra, and Lurie\u2019s work lifts these to maps of $\\infty$-categories, ensuring coherence of all higher operations\u301022\u2020L139-L147\u3011. Recent talks (e.g. by Jack Davies, 2023) indicate further generalizations: developing *stable operations on elliptic cohomology* by considering certain stable \u221e-categories of $E_\\infty$-algebras\u301022\u2020L139-L147\u3011. This direction often intersects number theory and geometry (since elliptic cohomology connects to modular forms), and it\u2019s an attractive area for someone in between algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. **Open problems** include understanding the \u221e-categorical symmetry (or automorphism \u221e-groups) of these structured ring spectra \u2013 for instance, the stable \u221e-category of modules over $\\mathrm{tmf}$ has rich subcategories whose $K$-theory or $THH$ (topological Hochschild homology) might reveal new \u201csecondary\u201d structures related to string theory or moonshine.\n\n- **Manifold Topology and Cobordism Categories:** Stable \u221e-categories are increasingly used in *geometric topology*, often via **cobordism categories** and factorization homology. The **Cobordism Hypothesis** (proved by Lurie) is a famous example: it asserts that fully dualizable objects in an $n$-dualizable symmetric monoidal $(\\infty,n)$-category correspond to extended topological field theories. In practice, many *stable* \u221e-categories turn out to be dualizable, giving rise to **TQFTs**. For instance, the span of *Lagrangian correspondences* in symplectic manifolds has been formulated as a symmetric monoidal stable \u221e-category\u30100\u2020L31-L34\u3011, yielding field theories related to the Fukaya category. Also, recent research by Hebestreit, Land, and others on **Poincar\u00e9 \u221e-categories** has direct applications to manifold invariants: using stable \u221e-categories with additional cobordism-like structure, they proved new results in *surgery and L-theory of topological manifolds*\u30107\u2020L665-L673\u3011\u30107\u2020L689-L697\u3011. \n\nIn summary, algebraic topologists are harnessing stable \u221e-categories both as an organizational tool (to cleanly state universal properties or carry out constructions \u201cup to all higher homotopies\u201d) and as a bridge to compute new things (Floer homotopy groups, or $K$-theory localized at chromatic primes, etc.). **For newcomers**: a good way to start contributing might be working out **concrete examples** \u2013 for example, pick a specific stable \u221e-category (like derived category of a finite field, or category of spectra with a bounded t-structure) and compute its $K$-theory or $THH$ using modern software or known spectral sequences. Even calculating small cases can provide evidence for general conjectures or suggest patterns (this kind of experimental math is quite suitable for a hobbyist or student).\n\n## Derived Algebraic Geometry and Noncommutative Geometry \nIn algebraic geometry, stable \u221e-categories manifest as **derived categories** and as building blocks of **derived algebraic geometry**. Lurie\u2019s *Spectral Algebraic Geometry* (Higher Algebra, etc.) introduced *\u221e-categories of quasi-coherent sheaves* on derived schemes or stacks, which are typically stable and symmetric monoidal. Post-2020, there are several active threads where \u221e-categories are pushing the frontier:\n\n- **Stability conditions and moduli:** One major crossover with algebraic geometry is **Bridgeland stability conditions** on triangulated categories (e.g. $D^b(\\text{Coh}(X))$ for a Calabi\u2013Yau variety). These stability conditions were originally inspired by $\u03c0$-stability of $D$-branes in string theory (work of M. Douglas)\u30103\u2020L33-L35\u3011. While Bridgeland\u2019s notion is usually framed in triangulated terms, recent research is investigating **enhanced (\u221e-categorical) perspectives**. For example, there are studies of *spaces of stability conditions* using the extra structure of $A_\\infty$ or DG-category models (which are essentially stable \u221e-categories). The hope is that \u221e-categorical tools can overcome some limitations of triangulated categories (like the absence of functorial cones) and thus clarify existence/uniqueness of stability conditions. A 2024 work by Ikeda, Ganatra, and others on **spectral networks** connects flat connections in string theory to stability conditions on Fukaya categories\u30103\u2020L14-L18\u3011. Exploring **stability in stable \u221e-categories** (perhaps via the notion of \u201chearts and $t$-structures\u201d in \u221e-categories) remains a fertile area\u30101\u2020L9-L12\u3011. Even as a hobby project, one could try to **visualize or compute examples** of stability conditions (e.g. for the derived category of a curve or K3 surface) using known criteria, thereby contributing computational evidence to conjectures about their geometry. \n\n- **Noncommutative algebraic geometry:** The philosophy of \u201ccategories as noncommutative spaces\u201d has gained rigorous footing with stable \u221e-categories. For instance, given any smooth projective variety $X$, one can consider its *derived category of coherent sheaves* $D^b(X)$ (enhanced to a stable \u221e-category), and ask to what extent $D^b(X)$ determines $X$. This is the realm of **Noncommutative Motives** and **categorical resolutions**. The result by Ramzi\u2013Sosnilo\u2013Winges, that every motive comes from a category, we mentioned earlier, is a piece of this puzzle\u301014\u2020L17-L24\u3011\u301014\u2020L139-L147\u3011. Another recent result along these lines is *Maxime Ramzi\u2019s theorem (2025)* that **\u201cevery (Voevodsky) motive is the motive of a stable \u221e-category.\u201d**\u301014\u2020L17-L24\u3011 This effectively means any classical algebraic motive (e.g. the motive of a variety or a correspondence) can be represented by a noncommutative motive of some category \u2013 strengthening the bridge between algebraic and noncommutative geometry. There is also work by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Tabuada and others on the idea that **derived categories are \u201catomic\u201d building blocks** of a would-be *noncommutative algebraic geometry*. Promising directions here include: defining **invariants of derived categories** that parallel classical invariants of varieties (like Hodge numbers, zeta functions, etc.), or studying **families of stable \u221e-categories** (analogous to algebraic families of varieties) and their moduli. An example question: *if two varieties have equivalent derived \u221e-categories, do their motives or K-theories coincide?* Progress on such questions would be valuable \u2013 possibly accessible to a Ph.D. student comfortable with both derived categories and classical AG.\n\n- **New geometric contexts:** \u221e-categories are entering *emerging areas like $p$-adic and analytic geometry*. Scholze\u2019s theory of **condensed mathematics** (c. 2019) and **analytic geometry** uses \u221e-categories of condensed/solid modules to handle sheaves on adic spaces. Here stable \u221e-categories provide the technical backbone for derived functors in non-discrete contexts\u301012\u2020L31-L35\u3011. For instance, Kedlaya and Pottharst\u2019s work on derived categories of (\u03c6,\u0393)-modules or adic spaces reframe certain cohomology theories in stable \u221e-categorical terms\u301012\u2020L31-L35\u3011. While deep in terms of background, this area has *accessible entry points*: a motivated hobbyist or student could start by examining a simpler analog (like the \u221e-category of complexes of Banach spaces, or the derived category of a Tate algebra) and testing formal properties (e.g. is it compactly generated? Does it admit a $t$-structure?). Such foundational checks often lead to publishable notes, given the rapid development of the field. Another example: **Virtual fundamental classes** in enumerative geometry (used in defining Gromov\u2013Witten and Donaldson\u2013Thomas invariants) are conceptually maps in a stable \u221e-category of motives or sheaves. Making this intuition precise (perhaps via *stable \u221e-categories of sheaf complexes with perfect obstruction theories*) could be a cutting-edge research topic connecting derived geometry and algebraic topology.\n\n- **Categorified Hall algebras and representation theory:** Interactions between stable \u221e-categories and representation theory are also on the rise. *Categorified Hall algebras* provide an example: here one considers the stable \u221e-category of representations (or complexes) of a quiver or algebra, and constructs an algebra object (often an $E_2$-algebra) out of its subcategory structure\u30109\u2020L21-L24\u3011. In recent works, such categorified Hall algebras have been linked with geometric representation theory and cluster algebras, suggesting a rich ground for contributions. Even as a side project, exploring a specific case (say, representations of a Dynkin quiver) and its stable category\u2019s Hall algebra can yield insight \u2013 possibly suitable for a well-prepared hobbyist or a student project in algebraic combinatorics. \n\n## Connections to Theoretical Physics \nStable \u221e-categories might seem abstract, but they have notable connections to theoretical physics, especially in areas of quantum field theory and string theory where algebraic topology and category theory intersect:\n\n- **Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs):** The *Cobordism Hypothesis* (a landmark result by Baez\u2013Dolan and Lurie) implies that giving an $n$-dimensional fully extended TQFT is equivalent to specifying a fully dualizable object in a symmetric monoidal $(\\infty,n)$-category. For low-dimensional cases, the target is often a stable \u221e-category of vector spaces or spectra. For example, an **invertible 2D TQFT** can be described by a line in a stable \u221e-category of spectra (essentially a 1-dimensional spectrum which is a fully dualizable object). More generally, stable $\\infty$-categories provide natural targets for **homotopical quantum field theories** (where one allows outputs in spectra instead of just numbers). Recently, physicists and mathematicians studying **quantum anomalies and invertible phases** have used stable homotopy invariants (like $\\mathrm{TMF}$ and other cohomology theories) to classify anomalies \u2013 a prominent example is the appearance of **topological modular forms (TMF)** in string theory as a generalized cohomology capturing the $U(1)$ anomaly of the Type IIA string\u30104\u2020L340-L347\u3011. The fact that TMF is constructed via stable \u221e-categorical methods (as an $E_\\infty$-ring spectrum and via its $\\infty$-category of modules) highlights the synergy: advanced QFT invariants often *live naturally in stable \u221e-categories*. A current direction connecting to physics is the study of **higher symmetries and categorical symmetries** in QFT, where one replaces a traditional symmetry group with a higher-categorical object (e.g. a fusion 2-category of line operators). While not always *stable* categories (fusion categories are typically semi-simple rather than homological), there are instances \u2013 especially in **topologically twisted theories** \u2013 where the categories of extended operators or branes are stable \u221e-categories. For example, the category of B-branes in a Calabi\u2013Yau sigma model is the derived category of coherent sheaves (a stable \u221e-category), and the category of A-branes is the Fukaya category (often taken as an $A_\\infty$-category, which has a homotopy equivalent stable enhancement). Thus, **homological mirror symmetry** is inherently an \u221e-categorical duality between two stable categories arising from physics. Understanding this duality deeper (e.g. proving new cases of mirror symmetry, or studying *autoequivalences* of these \u221e-categories as analogues of symmetries in physics) is a vibrant area bridging algebraic geometry, symplectic topology, and string theory.\n\n- **Stability conditions from physics:** As mentioned, Bridgeland\u2019s stability conditions were inspired by string theorist Michael Douglas\u2019s study of decaying BPS branes. In physics, a *stable D-brane configuration* minimizes some central charge, and mathematically this translates to a point in the space of stability conditions on a derived category. This is a beautiful example where *physics provided a key conjectural structure (stability conditions)* that is still driving pure math research. Recent work on **spectral networks and wall-crossing** (Gaiotto, Mozgovoy, etc.) continues this interplay: spectral network techniques from gauge theory help describe how stability conditions change (wall-crossing phenomena), which in turn informs the structure of derived categories\u30103\u2020L14-L18\u3011. A *promising research direction* at the physics interface is to incorporate **Donaldson\u2013Thomas invariants** (counts of stable objects) fully into the \u221e-categorical framework \u2013 potentially defining them via homotopy-coherent enumerations inside a stable \u221e-category. This could lead to new insights into quantum invariants like BPS state counts or index theory in supersymmetric field theories.\n\n- **Anomalies and Cohomology Theories:** In high-energy physics, certain **quantum field theory anomalies** are believed to map to elements of stable homotopy groups or cohomology theories. A prime example is the hypothesis that the Type IIA string partition function is naturally valued in an element of $\\mathrm{TMF}$ (which is a spectrum rather than just a number)\u30104\u2020L340-L347\u3011. Research by physicists like Arun Debray (2024) has explicitly linked *Type IIA string theory to $\\mathrm{tmf}$ with level structures*\u30104\u2020L340-L347\u3011. This suggests a world where physical theories are best understood not just via groups and manifolds, but via **morphisms in stable \u221e-categories of spectra**. One concrete avenue here is to classify **invertible QFTs** (which are essentially anomalies) using the stable \u221e-category of spectra: Freed and Hopkins have been developing a theory of invertible phases that uses stable homotopy (cobordism spectra) as the target. **Contributions**: A mathematician with physics knowledge could help by working out specific examples of this classification (say, classify all 3D invertible theories with certain symmetry using stable homotopy groups) or by clarifying the \u221e-categorical algebra of symmetry defects (which might form an $(\\infty,2)$-category with a stable homotopy dimension). These tasks require expertise but are highly interdisciplinary and impactful.\n\n- **Quantum Topology:** Lastly, even some areas of quantum topology (which straddle math and physics) are seeing \u221e-categorical influence. The study of **knot homologies** (like Khovanov homology, which categorifies knot invariants) has a link to stable homotopy as well: there is a *stable homotopy refinement* of Khovanov homology by Lipshitz\u2013Sarkar. While that particular example uses a *spectrum-level invariant of knots*, one could imagine a stable \u221e-category whose Grothendieck group recovers the knot polynomial. Exploring these kinds of constructions \u2013 essentially categorifying quantum invariants one step further into the \u221e-world \u2013 could be a playground for a creative researcher. For instance, can we organize all link homologies into one stable \u221e-category functorially, so that Kirby moves correspond to some well-understood operations in that category? Questions like this merge low-dimensional topology, higher categories, and representation theory (via quantum groups), and might be approachable with current tools.\n\nIn summary, theoretical physics provides motivation and context that often lead to new structures in stable \u221e-category theory. Conversely, stable \u221e-categories offer physicists a robust language to describe \u201chigher\u201d symmetries, extended operators, and state spaces that are not purely vector spaces. Collaboration across these fields is growing, so even hobbyist researchers with interest in mathematical physics can find niches \u2013 for example, writing expository notes translating a physical concept (like a topological line defect) into category language, or helping to compute specific examples (like anomalies in terms of cobordism spectra) \u2013 thereby contributing to both communities.\n\n## Research Opportunities by Experience Level\n\nFinally, we highlight some **promising research topics and projects** in this field, grouped by the background/experience level to illustrate the range of possible contributions:\n\n- **Hobbyists & Enthusiasts:** Even without formal academic affiliation, one can contribute to stable \u221e-categories by focusing on *concrete computations and expositions*. For instance, a motivated hobbyist could:\n  - **Compute K-theory or THH of specific categories:** Pick a small stable \u221e-category (perhaps the derived category of a finite-dimensional algebra, or the category of perfect complexes on a small scheme) and explicitly compute its algebraic K-theory groups or topological Hochschild homology. These computations, while specialized, are valuable test cases for conjectures (e.g., checking instances of the Dundas\u2013Goodwillie\u2013McCarthy theorem in new settings). Modern tools like spectral sequence packages or computer algebra systems can assist. Such results could be written up as short notes or blog posts and might answer open questions in papers (many papers ask for calculations in low-dimensional cases).\n  - **Contribute to open-source libraries/formalizations:** There is ongoing work to formalize \u221e-category theory in proof assistants (like Agda, Lean, or Coq in homotopy type theory). A hobbyist with programming inclination could help formalize definitions of stable \u221e-categories or prove basic results in those systems. This would lay groundwork for computer-verified proofs of the theorems we discussed\u301022\u2020L22-L30\u3011. Even writing clear expository code (say, a small library to manipulate chain complexes and simulate homotopy colimits) can aid others learning the subject.\n  - **Expository writing and diagrams:** Because these concepts are abstract, high-quality expository diagrams or animations can be extremely helpful. A self-learner might produce visualizations of concepts like \u201cfiber sequences in a stable \u221e-category\u201d or \u201cduality in a Poincar\u00e9 \u221e-category\u201d. Sharing these in online forums or articles can clarify the intuition for many and identify subtle points needing rigorous proof. One could also summarize recent breakthroughs (like the \u201cevery spectrum is $K$ of some category\u201d theorem\u301014\u2020L139-L147\u3011) in more accessible terms, thus disseminating knowledge and perhaps noticing corollaries that specialists overlooked.\n\n- **Graduate Students (Ph.D. Level Projects):** For those formally studying mathematics, many of the directions above are ripe for a thesis or first publications:\n  - **New Theorem Proving:** Tackle a *foundational conjecture* in stable \u221e-category theory. For example, **Quillen\u2019s Devissage Theorem in the \u221e-categorical context** remains to be fully established \u2013 a Ph.D. student could attempt to prove a version of devissage for stable \u221e-categories (building on the localization and additivity results\u30107\u2020L629-L637\u3011\u30107\u2020L637-L645\u3011) and apply it to, say, filtrations of triangulated categories arising in geometry. Another example is exploring the existence of **$t$-structures as certain factorization systems** in stable \u221e-categories, a topic that has seen partial progress but leaves many open questions (e.g. characterizing when an \u221e-category admits a bounded $t$-structure)\u30101\u2020L27-L31\u3011.\n  - **Interactions with Geometry:** A student could focus on a concrete geometric setup and its \u221e-categorical enhancement. For instance, **derived deformation problems** (like derived moduli of sheaves) produce stable \u221e-categories of complexes with extra structure. Studying one such example (e.g. the stable \u221e-category of matrix factorizations for a Landau\u2013Ginzburg model) in depth could lead to new insights about both algebraic geometry and category theory. This might involve computing its $K$-theory, finding a **Calabi\u2013Yau structure** (if one exists), or examining its behavior under equivalences \u2013 all manageable as a thesis topic.\n  - **Bridging to Physics or Data:** There\u2019s also room for interdisciplinary Ph.D. projects. For instance, **using stable \u221e-categories in topological data analysis**: one could attempt to categorify persistent homology by defining a stable \u221e-category whose homotopy category yields persistence modules, potentially enriching the invariants used in data science. While speculative, it\u2019s an example of fresh territory where a student could apply these ideas outside pure math.\n  - **Extending known results:** Take a known theorem in one domain and extend it via \u221e-categories. For example, Blumberg\u2013Mandell\u2019s theorem that $THH$ (topological Hochschild homology) of a ring spectrum is the homotopy colimit of certain simpler pieces could possibly be given a universal property *as an \u221e-categorical construction*\u301022\u2020L116-L124\u3011. A thesis could aim to formulate and prove such a universal property (some progress: THH was shown to be universal for *fiberwise linear* stable \u221e-categories in recent work\u301022\u2020L116-L124\u3011). This deepens understanding and likely leads to new \u201ctrace\u201d methods for computations.\n\n- **Advanced Researchers:** For an established researcher or a well-prepared postdoc, some of the most **far-reaching open problems** and directions include:\n  - **Higher \u221e-Categories and Stabilities:** Developing the theory of **stable $(\\infty,2)$-categories** or even higher. While stable $(\\infty,1)$-categories are well-studied, less is known about $2$-categories that are \u201cstable\u201d in some sense (perhaps meaning 1-morphisms form stable \u221e-categories, etc.). Such structures would be needed for potential 2-categorical generalizations of $K$-theory or for understanding duality in two steps (like 2-dualizability for 4D TQFTs). Some recent progress (Riehl\u2013Verity, Haugseng, Gaitsgory\u2013Rozenblyum) provides models of $(\\infty,2)$-categories, but a full *stable (\u221e,2)-categorical $K$-theory* or *secondary invariants* theory is largely open.\n  - **Unified Noncommutative Geometry:** Pushing further on the idea that **\u201ccategory = noncommutative space\u201d**, an expert might attempt to unify various invariants (K-theory, Hochschild homology, cyclic homology, etc.) into a single framework of stable \u221e-categories. For example, *noncommutative motives* could be extended to include **constraint of linearity over a base ring**\u301014\u2020L127-L134\u3011 (there are hints one can do \u201cmotives over $E_\\infty$-rings\u201d in Appendix B of Ramzi\u2013Sosnilo\u2013Winges\u301014\u2020L125-L134\u3011). This is cutting-edge and would likely yield a monograph\u2019s worth of material, linking homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, and category theory.\n  - **Deep conjectures in classical topology via \u221e-categories:** Some classical conjectures might be approachable using stable \u221e-categorical tools. For instance, the *Novikov conjecture* or *Baum\u2013Connes conjecture* are about $K$-theory of certain group $C^*$-algebras. An \u221e-categorical rephrasing (using the stable \u221e-category of equivariant KK-theory\u301010\u2020L97-L103\u3011) might shed new light or allow partial results via homotopical methods (like constructing assembly maps as functors between stable \u221e-categories and studying their properties up to homotopy). It\u2019s speculative but illustrates how one might bring the power of \u221e-categories to bear on hard problems.\n  - **Crossing the border to quantum physics:** Finally, an ambitious direction is to incorporate **quantum phenomena (like supercategories or enriched categories with analytic structure)** into the stable \u221e-category world. For example, can one formulate a stable \u221e-category that captures the category of representations of a *vertex operator algebra* (chasing a link between stable homotopy and conformal field theory)? Or could there be an \u221e-categorical framework for the **Categorical Langlands Program**, merging geometric Langlands (which uses derived categories of $D$-modules) with a hypothetical topological or quantum Langlands (which might use spectra)? These are uncharted territories where an established researcher might make a profound contribution.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of stable \u221e-categories is **rich and rapidly evolving**. Post-2020 developments have strengthened the foundations (making the theory more accessible and robust) and simultaneously branched out into new applications in topology, geometry, and physics. Whether one is a student learning the ropes, a hobbyist with a passion for abstract algebraic structures, or a seasoned mathematician, there are enticing problems to explore. The key is that stable \u221e-categories act as a unifying language \u2013 enabling communication between $K$-theorists, homotopy theorists, algebraic geometers, and mathematical physicists. Contributing to this field not only advances the theory itself but also has ripple effects on all these connected domains, potentially leading to breakthroughs that solve old problems with new \u221e-categorical insight.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Lurie, J. *Higher Algebra* (draft book), for foundational theory of stable \u221e-categories and their role in algebraic $K$-theory.  \n- Hebestreit, F., Lachmann, A., & Steimle, W.

You\u2019re exactly right about where the action is: push the \u221e-categorical story as far as possible, then prove there are honest (symmetric) monoidal model structures presenting it\u2014together with the factorisations, transfers and operadic control that practitioners actually need.\n\nBelow I (i) state precisely what the 2025 result buys us and how it tightens Lurie\u2019s bridge; (ii) lay out a research agenda that makes these presentations *useful* (localisation, operads, enrichment, uniqueness, higher-monoidal levels); and (iii) suggest concrete projects at three levels (rapid/PhD/PI). I keep the discussion focused on post-2020 leverage points and cite the recent sources that matter.\n\n---\n\n# 1) What\u2019s new, exactly\u2014and why it matters\n\n**Monoidal relative categories \u2245 monoidal \u221e-categories.** Arakawa proves that the homotopy theory of *monoidal* (and *symmetric monoidal*) relative categories presents the homotopy theory of monoidal (resp. symmetric monoidal) \u221e-categories. The payoff is immediate: **every presentably (symmetric) monoidal \u221e-category admits a (symmetric) monoidal model presentation**, promoting folklore and sketches to theorems of record (and giving a clean proof in the symmetric case that complements Nikolaus\u2013Sagave). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n**Provenance and context.** Lurie sketched the monoidal case (HA, Remark 4.1.8.9), long viewed as \u201cobvious but fiddly\u201d. Community attempts to fill the details show up in MathOverflow; Arakawa closes the loop. For the symmetric monoidal case, Nikolaus\u2013Sagave already gave a full result (and functoriality) a decade earlier; Arakawa\u2019s theorem packages both cases uniformly through monoidal relative categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n**Practical consequence.** We can now insist on *point-set* monoidal control\u2014Quillen bifunctors, pushout-product, unit axioms, transferred algebra structures\u2014*for any* presentably monoidal \u221e-category we care about. That puts localisation arguments, rectification of operads, and factorisation-friendly constructions back on firm, reproducible ground (see below).\n\n---\n\n# 2) Make it useful: a forward agenda\n\n## A. Localisation that preserves monoidal and algebraic structure\n**Goal.** Sharp, checkable criteria ensuring left/right Bousfield localisations of a monoidal model presentation stay monoidal and still present the *localised* (symmetric) monoidal \u221e-category\u2014and that algebras over operads survive intact.\n\n**Why now.** We have broad but classical criteria (monoid axiom, h-monoidality, etc.), and preservation theorems for operads/algebras (White; Pavlov\u2013Scholbach), but the landscape is uneven and not tailored to presentability-first workflows. Newer work shows localisations exist even outside left-proper contexts, and recent constructions are explicit about Day-convolution compatibility. What\u2019s missing is a *minimal* set of hypotheses that exactly matches what \u221e-categorical localisations demand. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n**Concrete targets.**  \n- \u201cIf $\\mathcal{C}$ is presentably (symmetric) monoidal and $L\\mathcal{C}$ is a smashing/local presentable reflection, then some monoidal model presentation of $\\mathcal{C}$ admits a monoidal left Bousfield localisation modelling $L\\mathcal{C}$.\u201d  \n- \u201cPreservation of $E_n$-algebras under localisation\u201d with hypotheses phrased in terms of h-monoidality + cofibrancy of operads\u2014matching the best-possible \u221e-operadic statements.\n\n## B. Operads, rectification, and moduli of algebra objects\n**Goal.** Rectify \u221e-operadic algebra data to strict operadic algebras *systematically*, and quantify the deformation theory (Quillen cohomology/cotangent complexes) in model-presented settings.\n\n**Why now.** We have rectification and admissibility frameworks, and brand-new work on Quillen cohomology for enriched operads and for algebras over operads; Hinich identified equivalence between major \u221e-operad formalisms. This is the moment to standardise \u201coperadic straightening\u201d as a monoidal Quillen equivalence and to compute tangent data for algebra objects in everyday model presentations. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search13\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search11\ue201\n\n**Concrete targets.**  \n- Produce *operadic straightening* as a monoidal Quillen equivalence in general indexing situations (recent 2025 work already does this for discrete bases, recovering Heuts\u2013Moerdijk).  \n- Compute Quillen cohomology and spectral Hochschild for algebra objects in favourite monoidal model presentations (spectral sheaves, QCoh on spectral stacks, Day-convolution functor categories). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201\n\n## C. Enrichment and spectral control\n**Goal.** Give criteria for when a presentably *enriched* \u221e-category (e.g. enriched in spectra or chain complexes) admits an *enriched* monoidal model presentation with good factorisations; stabilise \u201creplace with enriched functors\u201d as a standard move compatible with convolution monoidal structures.\n\n**Why now.** We have rectification of enriched \u221e-categories to strict spectral/dg categories in nice settings, and there\u2019s fresh, explicit work on enriched functor categories whose stable model structures are Day-compatible. Unifying these into a reusable theorem-schema is both feasible and very useful. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n**Concrete targets.**  \n- \u201cEvery presentably tensored/cotensored spectral \u221e-category with exact tensor admits a spectral monoidal model presentation.\u201d  \n- Factorisation functors that are (lax) monoidal on the nose in the enriched sense (use admissible replacements in the symmetric monoidal setting). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201\n\n## D. Uniqueness/rigidity of monoidal model presentations\n**Goal.** Classify monoidal model presentations of a fixed presentably monoidal \u221e-category up to *monoidal* Quillen equivalence; detect when a monoidal Quillen equivalence is forced by the \u221e-categorical data (no \u201cexotic\u201d point-set monoidal models).\n\n**Why now.** Nikolaus\u2013Sagave already proved that strong symmetric monoidal *left adjoints* between presentably symmetric monoidal \u221e-categories lift to strong monoidal left Quillen functors between symmetric monoidal model categories. With Arakawa\u2019s result, we can now ask for *converses* and rigidity: to what extent are the model-presentations canonical? This is both conceptually clarifying and practically stabilising. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n## E. Higher-monoidal levels and (\u221e,2)-control\n**Goal.** Extend the story to $(\\infty,2)$-monoidal (or braided) contexts where 1-morphisms already form stable \u221e-categories. Use strict $\\infty$-categorical Gray products and recent algebra on strict \u221e-cats to build model structures that present higher-monoidal \u221e-categories.\n\n**Why now.** There\u2019s active progress on strict \u221e-categories and Gray monoidal structures; it\u2019s timely to lift monoidal-presentation theorems across one categorical level. Applications include monoidal bicategories of correspondences (push\u2013pull) and factorisation-homology machines in higher codimension. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search14\ue201\n\n## F. Applications you unlock *by default*\n- **Multiplicative traces (THH/TC) and $K$-theory.** With monoidal presentations in hand, multiplicativity and cyclotomic structures can be tracked point-set. This complements global/symmetric-monoidal models used in \u201cglobal\u201d algebraic $K$-theory and ensures that *presentable* monoidal inputs (like module categories) can be replaced by monoidal model inputs without losing trace-level structure. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- **Derived and spectral AG.** Monoidal Dold\u2013Kan style rectifications (e.g. for comodules) and Day-convolution model structures on sheaves/functors transfer algebra objects faithfully; that\u2019s fuel for spectral stacks and QCoh-style constructions with honest model control. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search21\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 3) Concrete problems and projects\n\n## A. Quick wins (1\u20134 weeks; strong hobbyist/grad-ready)\n1) **Day-monoidal presentations by hand.** For a small monoidal $\\mathcal{A}$, build a symmetric monoidal *combinatorial* model structure on $\\mathrm{Fun}(\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathrm{op}},\\mathrm{Sp})$ whose homotopy theory is the Day-convolution presentably symmetric monoidal \u221e-category; record minimal hypotheses on $\\mathcal{A}$. (Leverage enriched-functor stability and Day-compatibility.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n2) **Localisation cookbook.** Take a standard monoidal presentation (e.g. symmetric spectra in some flavour), perform left Bousfield localisations used in practice (e.g. $p$-local/$E(n)$-local), and verify monoidality + preservation of $E_\\infty$\u2010algebras under published criteria; compare with the \u221e-categorical localisation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search16\ue201\n\n## B. Ph.D.\u2013scale (6\u201318 months)\n3) **Minimal localisation criteria.** Prove a \u201cbest possible\u201d theorem: a characterisation of when a reflective localisation of a presentably symmetric monoidal \u221e-category admits a *monoidal* left Bousfield localisation at the model level *and* preserves $E_n$-algebras. Calibrate against non-left-proper contexts using new results on localisation without left properness. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue201  \n4) **Operadic straightening as a monoidal Quillen equivalence (general base).** Extend the 2025 equivalence to non-discrete bases (indexed monoidal settings); compute Quillen cohomology for the resulting algebra objects and compare with \u221e-operadic cotangent complexes. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n5) **Rigidity of symmetric monoidal model presentations.** Classify monoidal Quillen models of a fixed presentably symmetric monoidal \u221e-category (e.g. $\\mathrm{Mod}_R$ for $E_\\infty$-ring $R$) up to monoidal Quillen equivalence; identify orbit-type invariants controlling the moduli of models (cf. Nikolaus\u2013Sagave\u2019s functorial lift). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n## C. PI/advanced (multi-paper programs)\n6) **Higher-monoidal model presentations.** Build monoidal (\u221e,2)-presentations via strict \u221e-categories with Gray tensor; apply to push\u2013pull $(\\infty,2)$-categories and factorisation-homology machines (Calaque\u2013Haugseng\u2013Scheimbauer paradigm). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n7) **Multiplicative $K$-theory and cyclotomic traces with model control.** Produce monoidal model presentations that make $THH/TC$ and cyclotomic structures *point-set functorial* for large classes of presentable inputs, then exploit them to prove new permanence results (e.g. under chromatic localisation) that are hard to touch purely \u221e-categorically. (Global $K$-theory robustness is a sanity check.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 4) Subtleties and traps (what to watch)\n\n- **Cofibrancy of operads/units and h-monoidality** remain the sharp edges; the newest admissibility frameworks help, but there is no universal \u201cfree lunch\u201d. Build with these hypotheses front-and-centre. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n- **Left properness is not guaranteed.** Use recent localisation-without-left-properness results to avoid false negatives; but check monoidality afresh after localisation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue201  \n- **Don\u2019t conflate existence with canonicity.** Arakawa gives existence of monoidal presentations; classification (uniqueness up to monoidal Quillen equivalence) is largely open and a worthy target in its own right. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 5) Executive summary (actionable takeaways)\n\n- The 2025 theorem elevates \u201cmonoidal model presentations\u201d from folklore to theorem: treat *any* presentably (symmetric) monoidal \u221e-category as one you can work with point-set-theoretically, with Quillen functors and factorisations in tow. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- The most valuable next steps are **structure-preserving localisations**, **operadic rectification with tangent theory**, **enriched spectral control**, **rigidity of models**, and **higher-monoidal extensions**\u2014all of which now have a clear runway thanks to that theorem. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search23\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can turn one of the Ph.D.\u2013scale agendas (e.g., \u201cminimal monoidal localisation criteria\u201d) into a precise problem list with lemmas and a reading plan keyed to the cited papers."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":1254,"end_idx":1299,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20606?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://arxiv.org/html/2504.20606v2?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20606?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20606?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Monoidal Relative Categories Model Monoidal $\\infty$-Categories","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20606?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1745921732.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Monoidal Relative Categories Model ...","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20606?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by K Arakawa \u00b7 2025 \u2014 We show that the homotopy theory of monoidal relative cate- gories is equivalent to that of monoidal \u221e-categories, as well as its symmetric.","attribution":"arXiv"},{"title":"Monoidal Relative Categories Model ...","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2504.20606v2?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Every presentably monoidal \u221e \\infty \u221e -category is presented by a combinatorial monoidal model category.
