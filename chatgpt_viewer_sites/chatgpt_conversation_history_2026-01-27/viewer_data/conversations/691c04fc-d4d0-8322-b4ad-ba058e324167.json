In other words: it is an orchestration layer for long-running, stateful \u201cagents\u201d and workflows, built inside the LangChain ecosystem.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n\nBelow is a concise orientation plus how you actually use it to build agentic workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What LangGraph actually is\n\nAt its core, LangGraph models your system as a graph:\n\n- **State** \u2013 a shared data structure (usually a typed dictionary) that holds everything your workflow or agent knows so far: messages, intermediate results, flags, etc.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- **Nodes** \u2013 Python functions that take the current state, do something (call an LLM, call a tool, write to a database, etc.), and return an updated state.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n- **Edges** \u2013 routing rules that decide *which node runs next* based on the state (fixed transitions or conditional logic). Cycles are allowed, so you can have loops and retries.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n\nLangGraph then gives you:\n\n- **Long-running, resumable workflows** via persistence/checkpointing.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- **Streaming** of intermediate outputs (for chats, dashboards, etc.).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n- **Debugging and visualization** via its integration with LangSmith and graph introspection.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- **Support for complex control flow** (branching, loops, multi-agent interactions).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n\nConceptually, it is a low-level, explicit alternative to \u201cmagic\u201d agent frameworks: you *draw* your agent as a graph and keep full control over what happens on each step.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Agentic workflows: what LangGraph adds\n\nAn \u201cagentic workflow\u201d is just a workflow where one or more LLM-powered agents can:\n\n- **Observe state** (messages, external data)\n- **Decide what to do next** (plan, choose tools, branch)\n- **Act** (call tools, mutate state)\n- **Repeat** until some termination condition is met\n\nLangGraph is well-suited for this because:\n\n1. **Agents = Nodes (or node clusters)**  \n   Each agent (researcher, writer, critic, planner, etc.) is just a node or group of nodes that read state, call an LLM and tools, then update state.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n\n2. **Agency = Conditional edges + loops**  \n   Edges encode the \u201cpolicy\u201d: given the state, which node (which agent or tool) should run next? That can be:\n   - A classic if\u2013else router (e.g. \u201cif needs_search \u2192 search node, else \u2192 answer node\u201d), or  \n   - A learned policy where an LLM itself outputs the name of the next step.\n\n3. **Memory = State + persistence**  \n   Because the state is explicit and persisted, your agents can accumulate memory over long tasks, do multi-step planning, and recover from failures.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n\n4. **Multi-agent systems = Graphs of agents**  \n   Multi-agent patterns (researcher + planner + executor, etc.) are just subgraphs within the bigger graph. Tutorials already show multi-agent storytelling, document analysis, and web-browsing agents using this pattern.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Minimal mental model + sketch\n\nHere is a slimmed-down sketch of a single-agent \u201ctool-using\u201d workflow.\n\n### 3.1 Define the state\n\nYou typically define a typed state:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\n\nclass AgentState(TypedDict):\n    messages: List[str]\n    needs_search: bool\n    result: str\n```\n\nThis keeps the conversation plus a flag telling us whether we should call a search tool.\n\n### 3.2 Define the nodes (agent + tool)\n\n```python\ndef agent_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:\n    # 1. Call your LLM with the messages\n    # 2. Ask it: \"Do you need web search? Answer yes/no\"\n    # 3. Return updated state with needs_search flag or final result\n    ...\n\ndef search_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:\n    # 1. Use a search tool / API\n    # 2. Append results to messages\n    # 3. Clear needs_search and maybe set result\n    ...\n```\n\nEach node is just \u201cpure-ish\u201d business logic over `AgentState`. Internally, nodes can call any model or application programming interface (API) you like.\n\n### 3.3 Define routing (edges)\n\n```python\ndef route_from_agent(state: AgentState):\n    if state[\"needs_search\"]:\n        return \"search\"\n    else:\n        return END\n\ndef route_from_search(state: AgentState):\n    # After search, go back to agent to synthesize answer\n    return \"agent\"\n```\n\n### 3.4 Build and compile the graph\n\n```python\nbuilder = StateGraph(AgentState)\n\nbuilder.add_node(\"agent\", agent_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"search\", search_node)\n\nbuilder.set_entry_point(\"agent\")\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\"agent\", route_from_agent,\n                              {\"search\": \"search\", \"end\": END})\nbuilder.add_edge(\"search\", \"agent\")\n\ngraph = builder.compile()\n```\n\nNow you can do:\n\n```python\nfinal_state = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [\"User: How did we get dark energy?\"], \n                            \"needs_search\": False, \n                            \"result\": \"\"})\nprint(final_state[\"result\"])\n```\n\nThis simple example already has:\n\n- A loop (`search \u2192 agent \u2192 ...`)\n- Conditional branching (with or without search)\n- Agentic behavior (LLM decides whether it needs search)\n\nThe quickstart docs show a similar pattern with a calculator agent.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Common agentic patterns in LangGraph\n\nHere are the main patterns people are actually using in practice.\n\n### 4.1 Retrieval-augmented agent (retrieval-augmented generation, RAG)\n\nA \u201cretrieval agent\u201d decides when to query a vector store and when to answer directly. Typical graph:\n\n1. **User input node** \u2013 append message to state.\n2. **Router node** \u2013 LLM decides `retrieve` vs `answer` based on the question.  \n3. **Retrieve node** \u2013 query vector store, add docs to state.  \n4. **Answer node** \u2013 LLM answers using docs in state.  \n\nLangChain\u2019s docs have an \u201cagentic RAG\u201d tutorial implemented directly with LangGraph primitives.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n\nThis is already an agentic workflow: the agent adapts its behavior (whether to retrieve, how many hops, etc.) based on incoming questions and past state.\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 Multi-agent pipelines\n\nYou can decompose a task into roles and give each role its own node:\n\n- `classifier` \u2192 chooses task type (e.g. summarization, Q&A, code refactor)  \n- `planner` \u2192 breaks it into steps  \n- `researcher` \u2192 uses search and tools  \n- `writer` \u2192 drafts  \n- `critic` \u2192 reviews & requests revisions  \n- Loop until `critic` is satisfied \u2192 `END`\n\nIBM\u2019s tutorial builds a creative storytelling pipeline (classify genre, plan outline, write scene, format dialogue) using separate nodes as agents.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n\nThis style is very natural in LangGraph because:\n\n- Each role can have its *own* tools and prompts.\n- Edges can encode \u201chand-off\u201d logic between agents.\n- You can branch (e.g. send to a \u201clegal reviewer\u201d agent only for high-risk content).\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 Tool-using supervisor loops\n\nAnother pattern is a \u201csupervisor agent\u201d that chooses among tools and sub-agents:\n\n- **Supervisor node** \u2013 LLM reads state and outputs an action: `\"call_search\"`, `\"call_db\"`, `\"delegate_to_planner\"`, or `\"final_answer\"`.\n- **Edges** \u2013 route to the corresponding tool/agent node.\n- **Loop** \u2013 after each action, route back to the supervisor until it chooses `END`.\n\nThis is basically a controller policy implemented as a node; the graph gives you:\n\n- Hard limits (max iterations)\n- Guardrails (e.g. \u201cif we see too many tool failures, route to human or abort\u201d)\n- Structured observability\n\nMulti-agent architectures in LangGraph papers and blog posts (e.g. security assessment, big-data workflows, LoRA-as-tools systems) follow this pattern with more specialized agents and external systems.\ue200cite\ue202turn0academia18\ue202turn0academia20\ue202turn0academia19\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Why not just use plain LangChain chains?\n\nLangGraph is useful when **any** of these are true:\n\n- You need **loops**, **branches**, or **multi-step planning** that cannot be expressed as a simple sequential chain.\n- Your workflow must be **long-running and resumable** (e.g. async back-office tasks, multi-day research jobs).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- You want **multi-agent coordination** with explicit routing logic.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n- You care about **debuggability and observability**: you want to *see* what happened at each node and replay or branch from a checkpoint.\n\nIf you just have \u201cone prompt in \u2192 one answer out\u201d, plain LangChain runnables or even direct LLM application programming interface (API) calls are simpler. LangGraph shines when the control flow itself is a first-class design object.\n\n---\n\n## 6. How to get started (practically)\n\nA pragmatic way to explore LangGraph in the context of agentic workflows:\n\n1. **Pick a task that clearly needs multiple steps or tools**  \n   Example: \u201cGiven a topic, search for 3\u20135 sources, extract key points, synthesize a report, and back up all claims with citations.\u201d\n\n2. **Write it first as a *manual* step list**  \n   Literally: \u201cStep 1: classify the request; Step 2: plan; Step 3: search; Step 4: summarize; Step 5: critique.\u201d\n\n3. **Turn each step into a node + state update**  \n   Start with deterministic edges (fixed order).
