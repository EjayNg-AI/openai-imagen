In recent years, it has repeatedly tested record highs, climbing above $2,070 per ounce in late 2023 amid global uncertainty and monetary shifts\u301025\u2020L307-L315\u3011. Looking 15 years ahead, gold\u2019s trajectory will be shaped by a confluence of macroeconomic trends, geopolitical risks, central bank policies, and supply-demand dynamics. This report examines the major factors likely to influence gold prices over a 15-year horizon (through ~2040) \u2013 including global growth, real interest rates, inflation, monetary and fiscal policies, geopolitical upheavals, currency dynamics, and physical gold demand/supply \u2013 and evaluates whether these drivers point to a bullish or bearish long-term outlook. Key quantitative projections from reputable institutions and analysts are incorporated to anchor the analysis in data.  \n\n## Global Growth and Real Interest Rate Trends  \nGlobal economic performance and real interest rates are fundamental to gold\u2019s outlook. Gold tends to perform best in environments of low or negative **real** interest rates (interest rates minus inflation), which reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. Conversely, strong growth that pushes real rates higher can be a headwind for gold. The IMF projects moderate global GDP growth of roughly 3% per year in the mid-2020s \u2013 *\u201cstable but underwhelming\u201d* by historical standards\u301027\u2020L384-L392\u3011. In fact, the IMF notes that its five-year-ahead global growth forecast of ~3.1% is the weakest in decades\u301027\u2020L384-L392\u3011. Such middling growth, coupled with high debt levels and aging populations in many economies, may keep real interest rates relatively low by historical comparison.  \n\nThere is debate on whether the world will return to the ultra-low real rate regime of the 2010s. Pandemic-era monetary easing pushed long-term real yields to around 0%, but by late 2023 long-run market-based real rates had rebounded toward ~2%\u20132.5%, levels last seen in the mid-2000s\u301032\u2020L437-L445\u3011. Federal Reserve analysis suggests the economy **may** have transitioned out of the post-2008 low-rate regime, possibly due to a higher neutral real rate or expectations of looser future policy (higher inflation)\u301032\u2020L437-L445\u3011. Even so, structural forces \u2013 such as demographics and high global savings \u2013 could cap how high real rates go. The European Commission and other researchers find that aging and slower labor force growth will *\u201ccontinue to contribute to lower real interest rates in the foreseeable future\u201d*\u301021\u2020L13-L21\u3011. Thus, while real yields might not be as deeply negative as in the 1970s or 2010s, they may remain historically subdued, especially if central banks revert to easing once current inflation is tamed. In summary, a **low-growth, low-to-moderate real rate** environment would be supportive for gold prices by keeping the metal attractive relative to interest-bearing assets. If instead growth surprises on the upside and real rates rise significantly (e.g. well above 2%), gold could face pressure \u2013 but such a scenario is not the baseline expectation of institutions like the IMF\u301027\u2020L384-L392\u3011. Gold investors should therefore monitor real interest rate trends closely, as they are inversely correlated with gold\u2019s performance over long periods.  \n\n## Inflation and Inflation Expectations  \nGold\u2019s reputation as an inflation hedge will be tested over the coming 15 years. The early 2020s saw a sharp spike in inflation across both developed and emerging markets, reviving investor interest in gold as a hedge. Looking ahead, **consensus forecasts expect inflation to moderate** from recent highs \u2013 the IMF forecasts global CPI inflation to fall from 6.8% in 2023 to 4.5% in 2025\u301027\u2020L389-L397\u3011\u301027\u2020L409-L417\u3011, with advanced economies returning near 2% targets by mid-decade. However, uncertainty around inflation remains significant. Factors like supply-chain realignments, energy transition costs, and expansive fiscal spending could keep inflation **above** pre-2020 levels. Indeed, the \u201cforecast corridor\u201d for gold prices in one long-term analysis varies dramatically *\u201cdepending mainly on how inflationary the next five years will be\u201d*\u30107\u2020L125-L132\u3011. High sustained inflation would be bullish for gold, prompting investors and central banks to seek refuge in hard assets. For example, Turkey \u2013 experiencing ~86% inflation in 2022 \u2013 became the world\u2019s largest official gold buyer that year (adding ~148 tonnes) as citizens and its central bank scrambled for an inflation hedge\u301010\u2020L125-L134\u3011. In contrast, if global inflation recedes to 2% and stays low and stable, one traditional rationale for gold (inflation protection) would carry less urgency, potentially softening demand from inflation-wary investors.  \n\nImportantly, it is **inflation expectations** and the interaction with interest rates that matter for gold. Should long-term inflation expectations become unanchored to the upside, real interest rates could turn negative even if nominal rates rise \u2013 an ideal scenario for gold. Historical precedent supports gold\u2019s hedge role: in the 1970s, surging inflation and deeply negative real yields corresponded with a 20x increase in gold\u2019s price. In the 2010s, inflation was low, but aggressive monetary stimulus kept real rates near zero, which underpinned gold\u2019s bull market from 2008\u20132011. By contrast, periods of deliberate disinflation (early 1980s) with very high real interest rates saw gold prices languish. Over the next 15 years, a **middle path** is likely: moderate inflation with episodic flare-ups. Markets currently expect inflation in major economies to average somewhere near 2%\u20132.5% in the long run\u301028\u2020L415-L423\u3011\u301028\u2020L437-L445\u3011. Yet the risk of higher inflation persistently (say 3\u20134%) is non-negligible, especially if fiscal debts are monetized or supply shocks occur. In such a scenario, gold\u2019s appeal as an *\u201cinsurance policy\u201d* against the erosion of purchasing power would strengthen. Even under baseline forecasts of declining inflation, central banks in emerging markets (which often face higher domestic inflation) are likely to keep accumulating gold as a hedge (discussed below). Overall, **inflation dynamics tilt gold\u2019s 15-year outlook toward the positive** \u2013 with the caveat that if inflation is decisively tamed and stays low, gold could lose some luster unless other drivers compensate.  \n\n## Monetary Policy Cycles and Currency Debasement  \nMonetary policy will heavily influence gold over the long term. After a decade of ultra-easy policy, major central banks have tightened aggressively to fight inflation in 2022\u20132023, lifting interest rates from historic lows. This tightening cycle initially created headwinds for gold by boosting bond yields and the dollar. However, **looking forward, policy is expected to pivot** once inflation is under control or growth falters. The IMF notes that by 2024\u201325, many central banks are likely to *\u201cease amid continued disinflation\u201d*, as long as price stability is restored\u301027\u2020L343-L351\u3011\u301027\u2020L409-L417\u3011. Market forecasts similarly anticipate the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates in the coming years, settling around a \u201cneutral\u201d Fed funds rate near ~3% nominal (implying modest real rates) by the late 2020s\u301021\u2020L19-L27\u3011. A shift from tightening to easing would remove a key restraint on gold. Indeed, gold often rallies when rate hike cycles pause or reverse \u2013 as seen in early 2023 when expectations of eventual Fed cuts helped push gold back above $2,000\u301025\u2020L307-L315\u3011. Over 15 years, it is likely we will see **multiple policy cycles**, including new easing phases (perhaps in response to recessions or financial crises) that could involve rate cuts and renewed quantitative easing (QE). Each wave of monetary easing or liquidity injection tends to bolster gold, as investors worry about **currency debasement** and seek alternatives to fiat money. \n\nThe concept of *currency debasement* \u2013 essentially the decline in a currency\u2019s value due to excessive money supply growth \u2013 is central to many bullish gold theses. In the past two decades, central banks expanded their balance sheets drastically (e.g. through QE after 2008 and during the 2020 pandemic), sparking concerns about the long-term value of paper currencies. Should high government debts and political pressures lead to more frequent **monetization** of debt (i.e. printing money to finance deficits), the resulting loss of confidence in fiat currencies would likely drive gold demand sharply higher. Gold, which *\u201cdoes not rely on any issuer or government\u201d* and cannot be printed, is viewed as a hedge against such debasement\u30109\u2020L191-L199\u3011. Notably, analysts point to the U.S. fiscal trajectory \u2013 debt held by the public surged from $5 trillion in 2007 to over $24 trillion by 2022, and is projected to reach $39 trillion by 2030\u301032\u2020L499-L507\u3011 \u2013 as a potential catalyst for **higher inflation or financial repression** in the future\u301032\u2020L475-L484\u3011\u301032\u2020L493-L501\u3011. High debt burdens increase the temptation to let inflation run slightly hot or to keep interest rates artificially low, in order to erode debt in real terms. Such policies would undermine currencies\u2019 purchasing power (*de facto* debasement) and enhance gold\u2019s appeal. In fact, the **prospect of currency debasement** is one reason some strategists believe gold will be a *\u201cstructural winner over fiat currency in the long term\u201d*\u301023\u2020L49-L57\u3011. \n\nThat said, gold\u2019s relationship with monetary policy is two-sided. If central banks were to maintain very tight policy for an extended period (e.g. real rates consistently high and money supply growth negligible), that would be bearish for gold. However, the political and economic costs of sustained tight policy (deflation, recession, debt crises) make such a scenario unlikely to persist for many years. The more plausible long-run scenario involves **periodic loosening** and continued expansion of money supply \u2013 conditions generally favorable for gold. In summary, unless the world enters an unexpectedly prolonged phase of austere monetary policy, the bias of central banks\u2019 actions (fighting recessions with liquidity, managing high debt) should support gold prices over the next 15 years. Investors will be keenly attuned to any resurgence of QE or rate-cutting cycles, as those tend to coincide with upward momentum for gold.  \n\n## Central Bank Gold Reserves and Policies  \nAn especially important development for gold in the last decade is the **surge in central bank gold demand**. After being net sellers of gold in the 1990s and early 2000s, the world\u2019s central banks collectively turned into net buyers around 2010\u301010\u2020L75-L84\u3011\u301010\u2020L85-L94\u3011. This trend has since accelerated, with central banks buying **record volumes of gold** in recent years. **\u301029\u2020embed_image\u3011 Figure:** Central banks switched from net sellers to large net buyers of gold after 2010, culminating in *record purchases of 1,136 tonnes in 2022*\u30109\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u30109\u2020L193-L200\u3011. In 2022, central banks added roughly $70 billion worth of gold to reserves \u2013 the highest annual tonnage increase on record (in data back to 1950)\u30109\u2020L179-L187\u3011. This marked a sharp contrast to the 1990s when many Western central banks were reducing gold holdings. The buyers in recent years have predominantly been emerging-market central banks, including China, Russia, Turkey, India, and Middle Eastern countries\u30109\u2020L185-L193\u3011\u301010\u2020L99-L107\u3011. Their motivations include: diversifying away from the U.S. dollar, hedging against currency risks and sanctions, and holding an asset that *\u201cholds its value through turbulent times\u201d*\u30109\u2020L189-L197\u3011. Gold\u2019s lack of credit risk and universal acceptance make it a strategic reserve asset amid geopolitical and financial uncertainty\u30109\u2020L193-L200\u3011. \n\nLooking ahead 15 years, central bank policies are poised to **remain a cornerstone of gold demand**. Surveys indicate that many central banks plan to continue increasing their gold reserves. A 2024 Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) survey of 75 central banks (managing $5 trillion in reserves) found a net 40% of them expect to boost gold holdings over the next decade \u2013 *\u201cdoubling down on the precious metal\u201d* after the record purchases of recent years\u301013\u2020L185-L192\u3011. In the near term, about one in three central banks surveyed had plans to raise gold allocations in the next 1\u20132 years (with almost none planning to decrease)\u301013\u2020L173-L181\u3011\u301013\u2020L185-L192\u3011. This is the strongest pro-gold shift in at least five years of surveys. The dollar\u2019s perceived reliability has been dented: 70% of central bankers in the OMFIF poll said the U.S. political environment now discourages them from investing in the dollar\u301013\u2020L189-L197\u3011. Instead, reserve managers see gold as the biggest winner from diversification out of dollars\u301013\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u301013\u2020L185-L192\u3011. Another survey by the World Gold Council echoed this sentiment \u2013 in 2024, **81% of central banks** said they expected global gold reserves to increase further in the coming year, a sharp rise from 52% in 2021\u301023\u2020L65-L73\u3011. These surveys underscore a structural trend: **central banks, especially in emerging markets, are likely to keep accumulating gold** to safeguard national reserves. Even if annual purchases do not match the extreme 2022 level every year (the WGC cautions that 2022\u2019s pace may not be sustained every year\u301018\u2020L98-L101\u3011), the direction of central bank demand is clearly upward, providing a steady underpinning for gold prices. \n\nCentral bank accumulation not only directly supports demand but also has a psychological impact on the gold market. When official sector buyers consistently enter the market, it signals long-term confidence in gold\u2019s value. This can reinforce investor sentiment and draw in other buyers on price dips. Over 15 years, if the trend continues, central banks could collectively add thousands of tonnes to their hoards. (Nearly one-fifth of all gold ever mined is already held by central banks\u301010\u2020L39-L47\u3011.) This **official backing** of gold is a fundamentally bullish factor. However, one should monitor if any major central banks reverse course. For instance, if high interest yields or other assets became more attractive, some central banks might slow purchases. Yet given the geopolitical and de-dollarization motivations (discussed next), a wholesale reversal appears unlikely. In conclusion, **central banks are poised to remain net gold buyers**, fortifying gold\u2019s long-term demand base and imparting an upward bias to prices. This official sector dynamic is a relatively new feature (only since 2010) compared to prior decades, and it adds a structural floor under the gold market going forward.  \n\n## Geopolitical Risks and Realignments  \nGold thrives in times of crisis, and unfortunately the next 15 years are unlikely to be free of geopolitical turbulence. The world is currently in a period of heightened geopolitical risk \u2013 from major power tensions (U.S.\u2013China rivalry, a war in Europe) to regional conflicts and realignments. These conditions boost gold\u2019s appeal as the ultimate *\u201csafe-haven\u201d* asset. In 2022, for example, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing geopolitical upheaval contributed to a rush into gold, both by investors and central banks (with some nations like Russia and China increasing gold to buffer against sanctions and dollar weaponization)\u30109\u2020L197-L204\u3011\u301010\u2020L99-L107\u3011. Going forward, scenarios such as prolonged great-power competition, wars or military standoffs, and global blocs fracturing trade and finance networks could all stimulate strong demand for gold. Investors tend to buy gold during crises for capital preservation when other assets (equities, currencies) look risky. Likewise, central banks in countries facing sanction risk or alliance shifts may preemptively raise gold reserves to guard against foreign asset freezes\u301010\u2020L125-L134\u3011\u301010\u2020L131-L139\u3011. Notably, around *two-thirds* of the gold that central banks bought in 2022 was **unreported** at the time \u2013 likely stealth purchases by countries like China and Russia aiming to de-dollarize and insulate themselves from Western financial leverage\u301010\u2020L131-L139\u3011. This underscores how **geopolitical motives** are interwoven with gold accumulation. \n\nThe next decade could see episodes of global instability (e.g. conflicts in the Middle East or Asia, debt crises, pandemics) that send investors flocking to gold. Each such spike in risk can produce price surges, as seen historically (gold spiked during the 1979 Soviet\u2013Afghan war, the 2001 September 11 attacks, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2020 pandemic). Over a 15-year span, it is reasonable to expect multiple risk-off waves. Gold\u2019s function as a hedge against **\u201cunknown unknowns\u201d** remains highly valued; it is one asset that tends to benefit from chaos and uncertainty. Moreover, a gradual *realignment of the international order* seems underway \u2013 for instance, the formation of stronger non-Western alliances (BRICS and others) who are exploring alternatives to the US-led financial system. Such realignments encourage participating nations to diversify reserves (often into gold and other currencies) and could eventually reduce the dominance of the U.S. dollar (a process we examine below). All of this would be favorable for gold demand. \n\nOn the flip side, if the geopolitical climate were to miraculously stabilize \u2013 e.g. major powers cooperate and global peace and stability prevail \u2013 safe-haven demand for gold could ebb. But this is not the consensus view of analysts. The World Bank and others cite *\u201cescalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty\u201d* as downside risks to the global outlook\u301027\u2020L363-L371\u3011. Such risks have, if anything, increased in recent years, and the **15-year horizon is likely to include significant geopolitical uncertainty**. In sum, the geopolitical factor strongly skews gold\u2019s outlook to the bullish side. Gold can be seen as a form of insurance against tail-risk events in the international arena. As long as there are potential flashpoints and power struggles in the world \u2013 a safe assumption \u2013 there will be a bid for gold to hedge those contingencies. This will complement the monetary and macro drivers in supporting gold\u2019s value in the long run.  \n\n## U.S. Dollar\u2019s Role and De-Dollarization Trends  \nThe U.S. dollar has been the linchpin of the global financial system for decades, and its relationship with gold is pivotal. Gold is often viewed as the *\u201canti-dollar\u201d* \u2013 its price tends to rise when the dollar weakens, and vice versa. Over the next 15 years, a key question is whether the dollar will maintain its dominance or gradually cede ground to other currencies and gold. Currently, roughly 58% of global foreign exchange reserves are held in U.S. dollars\u301015\u2020L237-L245\u3011. However, this share has been eroding (down from ~70% two decades ago) and is expected to decline further. According to the OMFIF survey, central bankers on average **expect the dollar\u2019s share of global reserves to fall to ~52% by 2035**\u301015\u2020L237-L245\u3011. It would remain the top reserve currency, but with a meaningfully reduced share. The euro and China\u2019s yuan are seen as likely to capture some of this share \u2013 with the euro\u2019s portion perhaps rising to ~22\u201325% and the yuan\u2019s tripling to ~6% of reserves by 2035\u301015\u2020L237-L245\u3011\u301015\u2020L241-L249\u3011. Crucially, gold is projected to be a major beneficiary of diversification: when asked about assets to move into as they cut dollar exposure, central banks overwhelmingly pointed to gold\u301013\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u301013\u2020L185-L192\u3011. In effect, **de-dollarization** (the gradual shift away from using the USD in trade and reserves) is a bullish undercurrent for gold. \n\nDrivers of de-dollarization include geopolitical rifts (countries seeking to bypass the dollar to avoid sanctions or dependency), and efforts by rising economies to promote their own currencies. For example, China has struck some trade deals in yuan and increased its official gold holdings to bolster confidence in the yuan. Russia has sharply reduced its USD assets and grown its gold reserves (now one of the largest globally) after facing Western sanctions\u301010\u2020L99-L107\u3011\u301010\u2020L125-L134\u3011. Many other emerging nations have similarly bought gold to hedge against currency and political risk\u301010\u2020L103-L110\u3011\u301010\u2020L125-L133\u3011. A recent WGC report noted *\u201cone of the reasons central banks are expanding gold reserves is de-dollarization\u201d*, as countries like China and Russia aim to lessen reliance on the dollar\u301012\u2020L13-L21\u3011. This trend accelerated after events like the freezing of Russian FX reserves in 2022 \u2013 which sent a signal that dollar assets can be politicized. Over 15 years, if geopolitical fragmentation continues, we could see the dollar\u2019s centrality diminish at the margins, with gold picking up some of the slack as a **neutral reserve asset**. \n\nIt\u2019s important to keep perspective: the U.S. dollar is likely to *remain* the single most important currency in 2035, and a disorderly collapse of dollar dominance is not expected by most experts. Over 80% of central banks in one survey still said the dollar provides safety and liquidity not easily matched by alternatives\u301012\u2020L5-L13\u3011. That said, even a gradual decline from 58% to ~50% of reserves is significant in absolute terms \u2013 it implies hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of reserves could be reallocated, some of which will flow into gold. Additionally, if U.S. domestic policies (fiscal or political) undermine confidence, the dollar could face spells of weakness that boost gold. The OMFIF survey highlighted that a growing share of central bankers are uneasy with U.S. policy uncertainty, with 70% citing it as a reason to shy from the dollar\u301013\u2020L189-L197\u3011. **Currency debasement** concerns also tie in here: the more the U.S. expands its money supply to fund deficits, the more value the dollar could lose relative to gold. In the extreme case of a secular dollar bear market, gold prices (typically denominated in USD) would rise correspondingly. \n\nIn summary, **shifts in the global currency order are likely to favor gold**. A diversified reserve mix in 2040 with less dollar concentration inherently means more room for gold (and possibly currencies like the euro or yuan). Even if the dollar remains strong in the near term, the long-run trajectory of reserve composition and **trust in fiat currencies** leans in gold\u2019s favor. Investors should watch indicators like the dollar index (DXY) and reserve statistics; sustained dollar weakness or accelerated reserve rotation would signal additional upside for gold in the long term.  \n\n## Consumer and Investment Demand for Gold  \nBeyond central banks, traditional **consumer and investor demand** for gold will continue to play a critical role. About half of gold demand globally comes from jewelry consumption, and another significant portion from private investment (bars, coins, and ETFs)\u301017\u2020L97-L105\u3011\u301017\u2020L100-L108\u3011. These segments are influenced by economic growth, cultural trends, wealth levels, and market sentiment. Over the next 15 years, **emerging market jewelry demand** is expected to grow gradually, assuming steady income growth in populous gold-loving countries like China and India. Jewelry offtake was ~2,100 tonnes in 2022\u301017\u2020L95-L103\u3011, slightly lower than prior years due to high prices dampening purchases\u301017\u2020L97-L105\u3011. As a rule, when gold prices surge rapidly, jewelry buyers (who are price-sensitive) tend to pull back, and when prices stabilize or dip, they increase purchases. The long-run trend, however, is that rising middle-class incomes in Asia support a higher baseline jewelry demand. Gold is deeply ingrained culturally (for weddings, festivals, savings) in countries like India and China. For instance, Indian demand remained robust in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels, even with price volatility\u301017\u2020L139-L147\u3011. Over 15 years, barring a scenario of exorbitantly high prices, jewelry demand could well exceed its 2010s average if emerging markets prosper. This provides a **floor of fundamental demand** under gold. Jewelry buying is less \u201cflighty\u201d than investor speculation \u2013 it tends to be steady, year in and year out, converting gold into cherished holdings that are only sold or scrapped when absolutely necessary. Thus, growing populations and wealth in gold-favoring regions point to a firm underpinning for gold consumption.  \n\nOn the investment side, private investors can exert substantial influence on gold\u2019s price, especially through channels like gold-backed ETFs, futures, and physical bar/coin purchases. Investment demand is typically **counter-cyclical**: it surges when economic confidence erodes or when inflation and financial risks rise. For example, in 2022, global bar and coin demand hit a 9-year high of 1,217 tonnes as retail investors sought inflation protection, even as ETF holdings saw outflows due to rising interest rates\u301017\u2020L100-L108\u3011. The net investment demand (bars, coins, ETFs combined) was about 1,100 tonnes in 2022\u301017\u2020L99-L107\u3011 \u2013 roughly on par with jewelry demand. Looking ahead, we can anticipate **episodic waves of investor demand** aligned with the macro environment. In periods of low inflation and strong stock market returns, gold investment may be subdued (or even see outflows as capital rotates elsewhere). But in times of market stress, recession, or rising inflation expectations, investors typically flock to gold, driving up prices. Over a 15-year horizon, it is almost certain we will encounter multiple such episodes of elevated risk-aversion (e.g. recessions, debt scares, banking crises). Each episode could ignite a burst of gold buying by investors, as happened during the 2008 crisis and the 2020 pandemic (when gold ETF holdings hit record highs). \n\nThere is also a secular trend of investors recognizing gold as a portfolio diversifier. Institutional allocations to gold remain relatively small \u2013 according to one analysis, *\u201cworldwide, markets and family offices dedicate merely 1% of their investments to gold and precious metals,\u201d* far lower than allocations to stocks, real estate, or even cash\u30107\u2020L139-L144\u3011. This suggests significant scope for increased allocation. If even a small share of global financial assets rebalances into gold (for example, rising from 1% to 2% allocation), it would translate to a huge influx of investment demand, given the large base of global wealth. Some analysts indeed advise that investors consider holding a higher proportion in gold as a strategic hedge\u30107\u2020L117-L125\u3011. Over 15 years, trends like **digitization (via gold ETFs), easier access**, and new gold investment products might facilitate greater investor participation. One caveat: the rise of cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) introduced an alternative store of value that attracted some investors (especially younger ones) as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d If crypto-assets remain part of the landscape, they could either complement gold (as parallel hedges) or compete for some of the same demand. So far, gold\u2019s unique tangibility and lower volatility have ensured it retains a distinct role. It\u2019s possible both gold and crypto will coexist as hedges against fiat debasement, but gold has the advantage of millennia of trust and central bank endorsement (whereas central banks do not hold crypto). This report\u2019s focus is gold, but it\u2019s worth noting that **the broader demand for inflation hedges** may be split among assets in the future. Still, gold\u2019s liquidity and history likely keep it at the forefront for conservative investors. \n\nIn summary, **consumer and investor demand is likely to provide solid support for gold prices** in the long run. Jewelry demand should track global economic and population growth, with upside from emerging markets. Private investment demand will ebb and flow with market cycles, but the overarching macro backdrop (periodic instability, currency concerns) suggests that on average, investment demand will contribute positively. If anything, the potential for greater mainstream investment allocation to gold is a bullish wild card. Together with central bank buying, robust consumer/investor demand means that gold will have multiple sources of buyers over the next decade and a half. \n\n## Supply Side Constraints: Mining and Recycling  \nThe trajectory of gold\u2019s price will also depend on its **supply fundamentals**. Unlike many commodities, gold\u2019s supply grows only slowly \u2013 the above-ground stock increases by roughly 1\u20132% per year from mining. Over 15 years, supply factors could become increasingly constraining. **Gold mining output** may be nearing a plateau globally. Industry analyses project that world gold production will likely **peak by the mid-2020s and then enter decline** towards 2030. S&P Global Commodity Insights, for example, forecasts gold mine production to peak at about 110 million ounces in 2026 and then fall to ~103 million ounces by 2028\u301020\u2020L304-L312\u3011\u301020\u2020L307-L315\u3011. (110 million ounces is roughly 3,420 tonnes; for context, mine production in 2022 was ~3,612 tonnes\u301017\u2020L109-L116\u3011, so S&P sees slightly lower output ahead.) The reasons are structural: major gold discoveries have become rare, ore grades are diminishing, and many large gold deposits are being depleted without equivalent new ones to replace them. An analysis of gold discoveries finds that since 2010, new finds have been smaller and less frequent \u2013 *\u201cthe number and size of significant new gold discoveries has declined considerably over the past decade\u201d*, with no recent finds cracking the list of largest deposits\u301020\u2020L275-L284\u3011\u301020\u2020L299-L307\u3011. Mining companies have also shifted focus toward brownfield expansions (existing mines) rather than higher-risk exploration, which limits the chance of giant new discoveries\u301020\u2020L299-L307\u3011. In short, the **pipeline of new gold mines** is weak relative to the past. Even if gold prices rise, bringing marginal projects online, there is a long lead time to develop mines and most will be smaller-scale. \n\nCurrent data already hint at stagnating supply: total gold supply (mine production + recycling) *\u201chalted two years of declines in 2022\u201d* with a modest 2% rise, but mine output still did not exceed its 2018 peak\u301017\u2020L111-L119\u3011\u301017\u2020L147-L150\u3011. Many analysts talk of \u201cpeak gold\u201d \u2013 not that gold will run out, but that annual production may have hit an apex. One mining consultancy warned that *\u201ceven if all planned projects come online, production could drop by as much as 17% by 2030\u201d* relative to its peak\u301019\u2020L5-L13\u3011. If these projections hold, **supply-side tightness will be a supportive factor** for gold prices. In economic terms, a flattening or declining supply curve, against a backdrop of steady or growing demand, implies upward pressure on equilibrium prices. Unlike oil or copper, where supply can sometimes surge due to large new field discoveries or technological breakthroughs, gold\u2019s geology and extraction challenges make a sudden supply boom unlikely. That said, higher prices could incentivize more exploration \u2013 there are some *\u201csigns of optimism\u201d* as exploration budgets have risen since 2017, leading to more prospective projects in early stages\u301020\u2020L323-L331\u3011\u301020\u2020L329-L335\u3011. But even a healthier exploration pipeline may only stabilize output rather than create excess. \n\nRecycling of gold (the melting down of scrap jewelry, electronics, etc.) is the other supply source, typically contributing 1,000\u20131,300 tonnes per year in recent times. Recycling supply tends to increase when prices are high (people sell old jewelry) or during economic distress (scrap sales for cash). For instance, if gold were to skyrocket, we might see a wave of recycling that adds to supply. However, recycling is inherently limited by above-ground holdings willingness to sell; it usually supplements but cannot *flood* the market unless prices hit extraordinary levels. The World Gold Council expects recycling to *\u201cfall [in 2023] but upside risks can\u2019t be ruled out\u2026 if distress selling emerges\u201d*\u301018\u2020L109-L117\u3011. Over 15 years, recycling will likely respond to price movements but not fundamentally alter the supply picture \u2013 it provides a flexible but modest buffer. The long-term cost structure of mining is also relevant: gold mining costs have risen (energy, labor, environmental costs), meaning the industry needs higher prices to incentivize new production. Many mines have **all-in sustaining costs** in the $1,200\u2013$1,600/oz range; while current prices are above that, any significant drop in gold price could lead to mine closures and further constrain supply, again serving as a floor under prices. \n\nIn sum, the **supply outlook for gold is tight**. Flat or declining mine output through 2040, combined with inelastic short-term supply, suggests that any robust increase in demand (from investors, central banks, or consumers) would mostly translate into higher prices rather than greater supply. Unlike some commodities, gold is not consumed (almost all gold ever mined still exists), but new supply is vital at the margin to meet new demand without drawing down existing stocks. If new supply growth is tepid, the market balance tilts toward demand-driven price appreciation. This is a key reason why many analysts remain bullish on gold\u2019s long-term fundamentals \u2013 *\u201cnew supply [is] harder to find\u201d*, as one report put it, even as demand hits record highs\u301020\u2020L202-L210\u3011\u301020\u2020L222-L227\u3011. Barring an unexpected mining technology breakthrough or massive discovery, **supply constraints will likely contribute to a bullish tilt** in gold\u2019s 15-year trajectory. \n\n## Long-Term Price Projections and Scenarios  \nProjecting an exact gold price 15 years out is inherently uncertain, but various analysts and institutions have outlined scenarios that provide insight into the **range of possibilities**. While most official bodies (IMF, World Bank, OECD) do not publish 15-year price targets for gold, many financial firms and experts have offered long-run forecasts based on the drivers discussed. These range from moderate to extremely bullish. A consensus among commodity analysts is that gold will **appreciate over the long term**, though estimates diverge on how much\u301025\u2020L353-L362\u3011. For instance, *J.P. Morgan* economists see substantial upside: they recently projected gold could reach around **$6,000 per ounce by 2029** (approximately +80% from 2023 levels)\u30107\u2020L117-L125\u3011\u30107\u2020L146-L151\u3011. This optimistic outlook assumes strong investor and central bank demand amid inflationary pressures. Another closely watched analysis, the *In Gold We Trust* report by Incrementum AG, presents a scenario where gold\u2019s price in 2030 ranges from about **$4,800 up to $8,900** per ounce, depending on inflation outcomes\u30107\u2020L125-L133\u3011. In their \u201chigh inflation\u201d case, if the next several years bring significant monetary inflation, gold could approach the upper end (~$8\u20139k by 2030) \u2013 signaling a robust bull market\u30107\u2020L125-L133\u3011. The same report emphasizes that this long-term upswing is not expected to be linear or without volatility, but rather that gold is at the start of a *\u201clong-term movement\u201d* upward\u30107\u2020L131-L139\u3011. Such figures imply annualized returns in the high single digits for gold, which some analysts argue is reasonable given gold\u2019s 20-year CAGR has been ~8\u20139% (helped by the low base in early 2000s)\u301025\u2020L399-L407\u3011. \n\nThere are even more bullish prognostications in extreme scenarios. Some commentators have floated the idea of **$10,000 gold** if fiat currencies were to falter severely or if gold were re-monetized as part of a currency system\u301025\u2020L368-L376\u3011. For example, a noted market strategist Jim Puplava envisions a *\u201csignificant bull market by 2030\u201d* driven by demographics and de-globalization, which could see gold potentially into five digits under extraordinary circumstances\u301025\u2020L376-L384\u3011\u301025\u2020L382-L389\u3011. These outcomes are on the fringe and would likely require a major currency crisis or a paradigm shift (e.g. a new gold-linked reserve system). While not mainstream, they underscore the **bullish tail-risk** for gold \u2013 in a world of runaway inflation or dollar collapse, gold\u2019s upside could be orders of magnitude higher than today\u2019s price. On the other hand, mainstream forecasts from institutions are more conservative for the medium term. The World Bank, for instance, as of 2024 projected gold averaging around **$1,950** in the mid-2020s (essentially near current levels)\u301025\u2020L327-L335\u3011. Many large banks like Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg\u2019s analyst teams see gold in the $2,000\u2013$2,500 range in the next couple of years\u301025\u2020L317-L325\u3011\u301025\u2020L343-L350\u3011, but they typically do not publish 2030 or 2040 targets due to uncertainty. One notable figure, Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone, speculated that gold *\u201ccould be heading for $7,000\u201d* in the long run, drawing parallels to gold\u2019s 84% rise since 2015 and Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory\u301025\u2020L347-L355\u3011. Again, such a number should be seen as a scenario rather than a set-in-stone prediction. \n\nTo synthesize: **reputable forecasts generally anticipate higher gold prices in 15 years than today**, aligning with the drivers we\u2019ve examined. The magnitude varies widely. A **moderate scenario** might be gold reaching around $3,000\u2013$4,000 by late 2030s, which would reflect only slightly above inflation-level gains. A **bullish-but-plausible scenario** (if several supportive factors align) could see gold in the $5,000\u2013$8,000 range by 2035, which corresponds to roughly a 7\u201310% annual return from a $2,000 base\u30105\u2020L117-L125\u3011\u30107\u2020L146-L151\u3011. And in an **ultra-bull case** (high inflation or USD loss of reserve status), five-figure gold is not ruled out, though this is not the base case. It\u2019s also instructive to consider real (inflation-adjusted) values: even at $5,000 in 2040, gold\u2019s real price might just be double today\u2019s in constant dollars, depending on inflation \u2013 significant, but not implausible given historical gold cycles. Meanwhile, it is hard to find any strongly **bearish** long-term projection from major institutions. A bearish case would require assumptions of low inflation, high real interest rates, and no crises \u2013 which seems a low-probability confluence. The absence of bearish long-term calls in research highlights that downside is seen mostly in cyclical corrections, not as a sustained 15-year trend. Indeed, even as gold faces periodic pullbacks, the overarching expectation is for an upward trajectory. As one investment manager put it, *\u201cgold can be a structural winner over fiat\u2026 over the long term\u201d*, and many of the trends discussed (debt, de-dollarization, etc.) underpin that view\u301023\u2020L49-L57\u3011. Investors and analysts will of course need to update their projections as conditions evolve, but current evidence tilts toward gold being higher 15 years from now, not lower. \n\n## Conclusion: Bullish or Bearish Trajectory?  \nWeighing all the major drivers \u2013 macroeconomic, monetary, geopolitical, and supply/demand factors \u2013 the **long-term outlook for gold prices appears broadly bullish.** The confluence of trends we\u2019ve analyzed tends to favor an upward trajectory for gold over a 15-year horizon, albeit with interim fluctuations. On the macro front, moderate global growth and persistent debt burdens likely mean real interest rates will remain relatively low, preserving gold\u2019s attractiveness\u301027\u2020L384-L392\u3011\u301032\u2020L437-L445\u3011. Inflation is expected to be contained compared to recent highs, but even a return to 2\u20133% inflation (and occasional flare-ups) provides a gentle tailwind for gold as a store of value. Critically, central banks are expected to maintain an accommodative bias in the long run \u2013 periodic rate cuts and liquidity injections to support economies \u2013 which aligns with gold\u2019s interest. The era of easy money may have pauses, but it is not over, especially given the political imperative to manage high sovereign debts. \n\nGeopolitical and currency dynamics further bolster the case for gold. We are witnessing a slow drift toward a more multipolar reserve currency system, where the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance is incrementally eroded in favor of gold and other currencies\u301015\u2020L237-L245\u3011\u301013\u2020L185-L192\u3011. While the dollar will likely remain paramount, even partial de-dollarization translates into sustained gold demand (both official and private) as a trusted alternative asset. Geopolitical risks and uncertainties show few signs of abating in the coming decade, meaning safe-haven demand for gold will periodically surge. Gold\u2019s enduring role as a crisis hedge \u2013 for both investors and nations \u2013 provides asymmetrical upside: in times of turmoil, gold tends to spike strongly, whereas in stable times any price drifts tend to be more gradual. \n\nOn the demand and supply side, the picture is one of strong demand growth meeting constrained supply. Central banks, consumers, and investors collectively pushed gold demand to an 11-year high in 2022\u301017\u2020L91-L99\u3011, and many indicators point to sustained or higher demand going forward (e.g. record central bank buying\u30109\u2020L179-L187\u3011, robust retail investment, recovering jewelry consumption). Meanwhile, mine supply is struggling to grow and may decline, removing a possible cap on prices\u301020\u2020L304-L312\u3011\u301020\u2020L307-L315\u3011. In classic economic terms, when demand outstrips limited supply, prices must rise to equilibrate the market. Gold\u2019s market is unique, but it is still subject to those forces. \n\nNone of this suggests a straight line upward for 15 years \u2013 gold will surely experience corrections, perhaps sharp ones, along the way. There will be periods when economic optimism or high interest rates make gold temporarily less appealing, leading to pullbacks. However, these episodes are likely to be *cyclical rather than structural*. Each time gold dips significantly, value-driven buyers (including central banks and long-term investors) are likely to step in, given the backdrop of currency and geopolitical hedging needs. Thus, declines may be limited in duration and magnitude. The **balance of risks** over the long run skews to the upside. Downside risks to gold (such as an unexpectedly hawkish monetary regime, or rapid technological disinflation) seem less probable or less enduring than the myriad upside drivers (inflationary policies, debt monetization, multi-polar world, etc.). \n\nIn conclusion, the **combined effect** of the factors examined is expected to result in a **bullish long-term trajectory for gold prices**. Many reputable forecasters concur that gold is more likely to rise than fall over the next decade and a half, with some projecting materially higher prices (several thousand dollars per ounce higher) by 2040\u30107\u2020L125-L133\u3011\u30107\u2020L146-L151\u3011. Gold\u2019s role as a safe haven and alternative monetary asset appears set to expand, not shrink. Investors planning for the long term may consider strategic allocations to gold to capitalize on these trends, keeping in mind that interim volatility will require a steady approach. In the end, gold\u2019s 15-year outlook is underpinned by the old adage that has reasserted itself in recent times: *\u201cNot all that glitters is gold \u2013 but gold glitters when other assets lose their shine.\u201d* Given the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape ahead, gold\u2019s shine is poised to endure and even brighten in the years to come. \n\n**Sources:** Gold Demand Trends and Outlook (World Gold Council)\u301017\u2020L91-L99\u3011\u301017\u2020L109-L116\u3011; IMF World Economic Outlook (2024\u20132025 projections)\u301027\u2020L389-L397\u3011\u301027\u2020L409-L417\u3011; Reuters and WGC data on central bank gold buying\u30109\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u30109\u2020L193-L200\u3011; OMFIF/Reuters survey on reserve diversification\u301013\u2020L185-L192\u3011\u301015\u2020L237-L245\u3011; S&P Global and industry reports on gold supply peaks\u301020\u2020L304-L312\u3011\u301020\u2020L307-L315\u3011; Times of India summary of long-term gold price forecasts\u30107\u2020L117-L125\u3011\u30107\u2020L125-L133\u3011; RBC Capital Markets commentary\u301023\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u301023\u2020L139-L147\u3011; and others as cited above."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":332,"end_ix":346,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Gold Price Forecasts / Predictions 2024, 2025, 2030, 2040, 2050 / Axi","url":"https://www.axi.com/int/blog/education/commodities/gold-price-forecasts#:~:text=recession%20that%20could%20be%20caused,the%20final%20quarter%20of%202024","text":"recession that could be caused by a new cycle of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.

Faster growth **could** push long-term real rates +50-150 bp, a classic head-wind for gold. | **Mildly bearish** unless central banks offset. |\n| **Inflation dynamics** | Moderate inflation (~2\u20133 %) with episodic spikes \u2192 **bullish floor** | Productivity is disinflationary (lower unit costs). If unemployment keeps wage pressure weak, headline CPI could undershoot targets, as in the 1990s tech boom.  That pulls down inflation premia and can raise real yields. | **Bearish** for gold **if** deflation fears dominate. |\n| **Monetary & fiscal response** | Periodic easing cycles, debt monetisation \u2192 **bullish** | Politically costly unemployment  \u2794 expansionary fiscal transfers (UBI, re-training) financed by larger deficits; central banks may cap yields or resume QE to stave off deflation.  IMF warns 40 % of jobs in AEs are \u201cAI-exposed,\u201d requiring \u201ccareful balance of policies\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201.  Such policies *re-lower* real rates and expand money supply, **re-creating a bullish environment**. | **Bullish tail-wind** likely dominates after policy response. |\n| **Geopolitical & social risk** | Rising multipolar tensions; central-bank gold buying \u2192 **bullish** | Mass displacement raises inequality and social unrest; populist politics, protests, and cross-border frictions can intensify (e.g., \u201ctechnological unemployment\u201d).  That usually boosts safe-haven demand. | **Bullish** |\n| **Dollar hegemony & de-dollarisation** | Slow erosion of USD share; EM central banks diversifying \u2192 **bullish** | U.S. may keep rates relatively high if growth outperforms, supporting USD **initially** (gold-negative).  Yet bigger U.S. deficits to fund social programmes can revive debasement concerns, while non-Western blocs still diversify reserves. | **Neutral to bullish** over full period; timeline could shift. |\n| **Consumer & investor demand** | EM jewelry + episodic ETF inflows \u2192 **bullish** | Higher unemployment in AEs could dent discretionary investment flows *temporarily*; but rising EM incomes from productivity gains **support jewelry demand**.  Portfolio hedging demand persists if macro volatility stays high. | **Net neutral / slightly bullish** |\n| **Supply side** | Mine output plateau, limited new discoveries \u2192 **bullish** | Supply fundamentals unchanged by AI boom. If lower energy costs from AI-optimised operations cut mining costs, supply could rise marginally, but geology remains the bottleneck. | **Still bullish** |\n\n---\n\n#### Key Take-aways\n\n1. **First-round effect is head-wind**  \n   *Higher productivity + lower inflation = higher real yields = lower opportunity cost for holding yield-bearing assets.*  In past tech booms (mid-1990s), gold under-performed for exactly this reason.\n\n2. **Second-round policy response flips the sign**  \n   *Persistent technological unemployment forces looser fiscal-monetary policy to maintain demand.*  That tends to **re-compress real rates** and expand public debt\u2014conditions historically bullish for gold.\n\n3. **Risk-regime likely becomes more volatile**  \n   Even with higher trend growth, the social dislocation from job losses magnifies tail-risk events (political swings, unrest, \u201cAI nationalism\u201d).  Gold\u2019s role as a **crisis hedge** strengthens.\n\n4. **Central-bank behaviour unlikely to reverse**  \n   Non-OECD reserve managers diversify from USD partly to insure against Western policy risk.  AI does not change that calculus; indeed, technology-driven strategic rivalry could accelerate it.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom-line Impact on the 15-Year Outlook\n\n| Phase | Likely path for gold | Rationale |\n|-------|---------------------|-----------|\n| **Early 2030s (immediate AI lift)** | **Sideways to mildly weaker** if real rates rise faster than policy shifts. | Productivity surprise > disinflation \u2192 central banks slow to ease. |\n| **Mid-to-late 2030s (policy catch-up & social adjustment)** | **Reasserted bull trend**, potentially steeper than baseline. | Fiscal deficits, QE 2.0, and socio-political risk push real yields back down; safe-haven & CB demand surge. |\n| **Net 15-year view** | **Still bullish**, but with a bumpier trajectory and greater dispersion of outcomes. | Structural supply tightness + policy accommodation outweigh the disinflation head-wind. Scenario widens the fork between a \u201ctech-goldilocks\u201d bear case and a \u201cpolicy-panic\u201d super-bull case. |\n\n**Therefore:**  \nA massive AI-driven productivity boom **does not nullify** the longer-term bullish thesis for gold, but **it does change the timing and volatility** of price movements.  Investors should expect an initial period where stronger growth and low inflation curb gold\u2019s momentum, followed by renewed tail-winds once policy makers respond to sustained unemployment and social stress.  Portfolio allocations might thus emphasize tactical flexibility\u2014lightening exposure during a real-rate surge but maintaining or adding strategic positions ahead of likely policy pivots and rising geopolitical risk."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":648,"end_idx":667,"safe_urls":["https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7% - Goldman Sachs","url":"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1680652800.0,"snippet":"They could drive a 7% (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"goldmansachs.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":678,"end_idx":697,"safe_urls":["https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([mckinsey.com](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Economic potential of generative AI | McKinsey","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1686700800.0,"snippet":"We identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could deliver total value in the range of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"mckinsey.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":1581,"end_idx":1613,"safe_urls":["https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/SDN/2024/English/SDNEA2024001.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([imf.org](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/SDN/2024/English/SDNEA2024001.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [imf.org](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work - IMF","url":"https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/SDN/2024/English/SDNEA2024001.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1709298455.0,"snippet":"Overall exposure is 40 percent in emerging market economies and 26 percent in low-income countries.

Executive synthesis  \nOver a three\u2011decade horizon, **structural forces tilt the balance decisively toward a higher real and nominal gold price**, although the path will be choppier and more policy\u2011sensitive than in the past.  Drivers that dominated our 15\u2011year study\u2014low/volatile real rates, de\u2011dollarisation and central\u2010bank accumulation, episodic inflation spikes, and supply constraints\u2014remain in place.  New or amplified forces over 30\u202fyears reinforce rather than contradict that view:\n\n| New/Amplified force | Why it matters for gold                                                                                                     | Net 30\u2011yr bias |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Multi\u2011polar reserve order** | Dollar share of FX reserves forecast to slip from 58\u202f% to ~52\u202f% by 2035 with gold, euro and yuan picking up the slack \ue200cite\ue202turn1news40\ue201 | **Bullish** |\n| **Long\u2011run protectionism** | OECD/IMF find trade\u2011policy uncertainty suppresses growth and raises costs; tariffs are inflationary and volatility\u2011enhancing \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search3\ue201 | Bullish |\n| **Rising geopolitical & racial tensions** | Safe\u2011haven flows accelerate whenever social fractures widen (recent gold repatriation demands in Europe are a micro\u2011signal) \ue200cite\ue202turn0news68\ue201 | Bullish |\n| **Recursive\u2011AI productivity surge** | First\u2011round: higher real growth/real rates = head\u2011wind.

Macro\u2011financial backdrop  \n\n* **Productivity vs. secular unemployment.**  McKinsey and Dallas\u202fFed mid\u2011range estimates put AI\u2011boosted productivity at +0.3\u202f\u2013\u202f0.6\u202fpp per year through 2040 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search1\ue201.  Yet OECD and WEF show 25\u202f\u2013\u202f60\u202f% of jobs *exposed* to automation, implying chronically higher structural unemployment and downward wage pressure \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2news10\ue201.  Governments will likely respond with bigger safety\u2011net spending, subsidised re\u2011skilling and, in several jurisdictions, variants of basic income.  **Result:** upward drift in fiscal deficits and public debt that necessitates periods of yield\u2011curve control or renewed QE\u2014re\u2011creating the negative\u2011real\u2011rate environment gold thrives on.\n\n* **Inflation regime.**  Protectionism and climate\u2011related supply shocks (food, metals) introduce *cost\u2011push* inflation episodes even as AI exerts *disinflationary* pressure on tradable services.  Expect a *volatile band* (1.5\u202f\u2013\u202f4\u202f% CPI in DM, 3\u202f\u2013\u202f6\u202f% in EM) rather than the anchored ~2\u202f% of 1997\u20112019.  Volatility, not just the level, is bullish: gold\u2019s long\u2011run Sharpe ratio improves when inflation jumps unpredictably.\n\n* **Real rate trajectory.**  Higher neutral real rates from productivity are offset by financial\u2011repression policies needed to fund ageing\u2011related outlays and climate transition.  Consensus long\u2011term real 10\u2011yr UST now sits near 1.5\u202f% (up from 0\u202f% in 2021) but market surveys do **not** project >2\u202f% sustainably\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.  Gold remains competitive versus bonds.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Geopolitics, de\u2011dollarisation and central\u2011bank demand  \n\n* **Reserve fragmentation.**  An OMFIF survey finds a net 40\u202f% of central banks plan to raise gold over the next decade\u2014highest on record \ue200cite\ue202turn1news40\ue201.  With US extraterritorial sanctions repeatedly weaponising dollar assets, EM authorities see bullion as sanctions\u2011proof collateral.  The euro and yuan gain share but gold is the *only* asset viewed as politically neutral.\n\n* **Contestation flash\u2011points.**  RAND and Carnegie studies highlight persistent US\u2013China rivalry, proxy conflicts in the Middle East, and Russian revisionism \ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search0\ue201.  Each crisis cycle historically pushes gold 5\u201115\u202f% higher in real terms; over 30 years, expect multiple such waves.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Protectionism and fractured supply chains  \n\nIMF and OECD both flag record trade\u2011policy uncertainty indices in 2024\u201125, with long\u2011run modelling showing cumulative global GDP hit of 2\u20113\u202fpp by 2030 if tariff walls persist \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201.  Lower growth is normally gold\u2011positive via dovish policy; supply\u2011chain frictions also periodically spike commodity and shipping prices, stirring stagflation fears\u2014again gold\u2011positive.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Climate change and ESG pressures  \n\n* **Physical risks.**  Extreme rainfall, heatwaves and water scarcity threaten open\u2011pit and underground mines.  UNEP\u2011FI finds metals output could face \u201csubstantial supply disruptions\u201d by mid\u2011century \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201.  LBMA warns that landslides and flooding already disrupt some operations \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue201.\n\n* **Transition risks & cap\u2011ex.**  WGC calculates the sector must cut emissions \u2248\u202f92\u202f% by 2040 to align with 1.5\u202f\u00b0C, implying sustained cap\u2011ex, higher production costs and slower net supply growth \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue201.\n\n* **Portfolio implications.**  Gold\u2019s own carbon footprint per US\u2011$1 of value is among the lowest of major raw materials; WGC finds gold can *lower* the financed\u2011emission intensity of multi\u2011asset portfolios under rising carbon\u2011price scenarios \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201.  That keeps institutional demand intact even as ESG screens tighten.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Technology, AI tokenisation and digital rails  \n\n* **Tokenised gold** on public and permissioned blockchains converts previously \u201csticky\u201d retail demand into 24/7, micro\u2011lot tradable units.  Security Token Market projects US\u202f$30\u202ftn of real\u2011world\u2011asset tokenisation by 2030, with gold a leading slice \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201.  Fractional ownership deepens liquidity and broadens the buyer base\u2014structurally bullish.\n\n* **CBDCs** facilitate instant settlement of physically backed gold, lowering frictional costs for cross\u2011border payments.  While CBDCs compete with banknotes, they **complement** bullion as a neutral reserve asset.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. Supply trajectory to 2055  \n\n\u201cPeak\u2011gold\u201d remains a credible thesis: S&P Global sees mine output plateauing mid\u20112020s and declining 10\u201115\u202f% by early 2030s; new discoveries are smaller and rarer \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.  Even if AI\u2011enabled exploration adds marginal deposits, permitting, ESG litigation and water constraints lengthen lead\u2011times, keeping annual supply growth <\u202f1\u202f% per year.  Recycling flexes cyclically but cannot fill a structural shortfall.\n\n---\n\n#### 8. Demand trajectory  \n\n* **Central banks:** \u2265\u202f700\u202ft p.a. baseline through the 2030s, tapering only marginally thereafter if geopolitical tensions ease; cumulative net additions 2025\u201155 could exceed 15\u202f000\u202ft\u2014~25\u202f% of all official reserves today.\n\n* **Investment:**  Portfolio insurance role endures; tokenised products add incremental channels.  Expect net investment 1\u202f000\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u202f500\u202ft p.a. on average, spiking above 2\u202f000\u202ft in crisis years.\n\n* **Jewellery/technology:** Gradual growth in EM Asia and Africa offsets Western substitution; by 2055 jewellery could still account for ~40\u202f% of total demand, but with higher value per ounce.\n\n---\n\n#### 9. Price scenarios (constant 2025 dollars)\n\n| Scenario (2055) | Key assumptions | Real 2055 gold price* | Nominal** |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------|\n| **\u201cTech\u2011Goldilocks\u201d** (bear case) | AI raises real GDP, keeps inflation at 1\u202f\u00bd\u202f%, real 10\u2011yr yields avg\u202f3\u202f%; geopolitics benign | **$1\u202f600** | ~$3\u202f700 |\n| **Baseline** | Moderate growth, episodic stagflation, real rates 1\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f%; steady CB buying, protectionism and climate shocks | **$2\u202f700** | ~$6\u202f200 |\n| **Super\u2011cycle / currency reset** | Major debt crisis triggers global monetary overhaul, partial gold\u2011backing of CBDCs, USD share <\u202f40\u202f% | **$6\u202f000\u202f+** | >\u202f$13\u202f500 |\n\n\\*In 2025 purchasing\u2011power terms.  **Assumes average 2.5\u202f% global CPI thereafter.**  Baseline implies a real CAGR of \u2248\u202f1.9\u202f% (nominal \u2248\u202f4.4\u202f%).\n\n---\n\n### 10. Strategic implications\n\n1. **Allocation timing:**  Expect an *AI\u2011boom dip* if real yields lurch higher in the late\u20112020s; that is likely a medium\u2011term buying opportunity before fiscal reflation returns.  \n2. **Geopolitical hedge:**  With more great\u2011power flash\u2011points, bullion\u2019s tail\u2011risk hedging utility rises; volatility spikes should be used to rebalance rather than exit.  \n3. **ESG integration:**  Developers and refiners who decarbonise fastest will capture supply premiums; investors should prefer bullion traced to low\u2011carbon mines.  \n4. **Digital rails:**  Exposure via tokenised gold or CBDC\u2011settled vaulted gold can reduce custody friction, but smart\u2011contract and jurisdiction risk must be evaluated.  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \n\n**Across a 30\u2011year horizon, every durable mega\u2011trend except a highly unlikely, peaceful, high\u2011growth/low\u2011debt \u201ctech\u2011utopia\u201d points to a structurally higher equilibrium price for gold.**  Investors who require an anchor for purchasing\u2011power preservation and geopolitical hedge have few substitutes with gold\u2019s liquidity and neutrality.  Periodic cyclical head\u2011winds (AI\u2011induced real\u2011rate spikes) are therefore tactical rather than strategic obstacles.  \n\n> **Strategic stance (to\u202f2055): Maintain a core bullion allocation; add tactically on real\u2011yield spikes; overweight if a debt\u2011monetisation or geopolitical\u2011risk regime takes hold.**\n\n---\n\n**Key sources**  \nCentral\u2011bank diversification \ue200cite\ue202turn1news40\ue201; reserve repatriation & mistrust \ue200cite\ue202turn0news68\ue201; protectionism & trade\u2011uncertainty \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search3\ue201; AI productivity & labour displacement \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn2search2\ue201; climate\u2011risk to mining \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search9\ue201; supply plateau \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201; tokenisation forecast \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201; great\u2011power rivalry in the Middle East \ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue201."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news40\ue201","start_idx":1050,"end_idx":1068,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/world/china/central-banks-eye-gold-euro-yuan-dollar-dominance-wanes-2025-06-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/central-banks-eye-gold-euro-yuan-dollar-dominance-wanes-2025-06-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Central banks eye gold, euro and yuan as dollar dominance wanes","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/central-banks-eye-gold-euro-yuan-dollar-dominance-wanes-2025-06-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750753659.0,"snippet":"A recent report by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) reveals that global central banks, managing a combined $5 trillion in reserves, are increasingly diversifying away from the U.S. dollar following recent geopolitical and market upheavals, including policies introduced by U.S. President Donald Trump. The shift is boosting interest in gold, the euro, and China's yuan. A net 40% of central banks plan to increase gold holdings over the next decade, the highest level in five years. The dollar, once the most favored currency, dropped to seventh place in popularity, with 70% of respondents citing the U.S. political environment as a deterrent. The euro is now the most in-demand currency for near-term reserve increases, with a net 16% of banks planning to raise euro holdings, followed closely by the yuan. Over the next decade, the yuan's share of global reserves could triple to 6%.

Politicians in Germany and Italy, concerned about potential political influence by the U.S. under President Trump, are requesting the return of approximately $245 billion in gold. Despite no current movements of bullion, the situation signals eroding confidence in the U.S. financial system. Meanwhile, gold inflows into America have increased, suggesting heightened investor caution. In Asia, rising gold demand and a pivot away from dollar assets demonstrate efforts to diversify. China, in particular, is advancing alternatives to U.S.-dominated financial infrastructure, including expanding renminbi use and promoting the CIPS and mBridge digital currency initiatives. Europe remains largely passive, though there is growing advocacy for \"geofinance\" and the development of a single European capital market and a digital euro. However, these efforts lack the momentum to challenge the dollar\u2019s dominance. Emerging concerns foreshadow potential geopolitical and financial shifts, with Europe vulnerable to U.S. economic control. The debate over gold storage underscores these anxieties, suggesting that once-unthinkable scenarios, like using bullion for political leverage, are now being considered.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":68}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"ft.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn2search2\ue201","start_idx":1677,"end_idx":1709,"safe_urls":["https://oecd.ai/en/incidents/2025-04-28-82f1?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([mckinsey.com](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [oecd.ai](https://oecd.ai/en/incidents/2025-04-28-82f1?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Economic potential of generative AI - McKinsey","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1686700800.0,"snippet":"Generative AI could enable labor productivity growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"mckinsey.com"},{"title":"AI could displace 300 million jobs by 2050, warns major reports","url":"https://oecd.ai/en/incidents/2025-04-28-82f1?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Reports from PwC, McKinsey and the World Economic Forum warn that AI-driven automation could affect 60% of jobs by 2050, potentially displacing around 300 ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"oecd.ai"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search9\ue201","start_idx":1917,"end_idx":1949,"safe_urls":["https://www.gold.org/download/file/14316/gold-and-climate-change-current-and-future-impacts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/alchemist-111/gold-and-climate-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([gold.org](https://www.gold.org/download/file/14316/gold-and-climate-change-current-and-future-impacts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/alchemist-111/gold-and-climate-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] Gold and climate change: Current and future impacts","url":"https://www.gold.org/download/file/14316/gold-and-climate-change-current-and-future-impacts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1591720547.0,"snippet":"Steps towards a net zero carbon gold supply chain by 2050.

The shift is boosting interest in gold, the euro, and China's yuan. A net 40% of central banks plan to increase gold holdings over the next decade, the highest level in five years. The dollar, once the most favored currency, dropped to seventh place in popularity, with 70% of respondents citing the U.S. political environment as a deterrent. The euro is now the most in-demand currency for near-term reserve increases, with a net 16% of banks planning to raise euro holdings, followed closely by the yuan. Over the next decade, the yuan's share of global reserves could triple to 6%. Analysts believe the euro could regain a 25% share of global reserves, recovering ground lost during the eurozone crisis, especially if the EU strengthens its bond market and capital integration. Despite the diversification, the dollar is still expected to maintain a dominant 52% share of reserves by 2035, down from 58% today.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"reuters.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news68\ue201","start_idx":10121,"end_idx":10139,"safe_urls":["https://www.ft.com/content/6b23c2f0-13ff-4666-ad56-880bfa4428f4?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/6b23c2f0-13ff-4666-ad56-880bfa4428f4?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gold glitters as mistrust spreads","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/6b23c2f0-13ff-4666-ad56-880bfa4428f4?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750996814.254,"snippet":"Rising global mistrust is prompting calls for the repatriation of foreign gold reserves held in the New York Federal Reserve, traditionally considered the world\u2019s largest gold vault. Politicians in Germany and Italy, concerned about potential political influence by the U.S. under President Trump, are requesting the return of approximately $245 billion in gold. Despite no current movements of bullion, the situation signals eroding confidence in the U.S. financial system. Meanwhile, gold inflows into America have increased, suggesting heightened investor caution. In Asia, rising gold demand and a pivot away from dollar assets demonstrate efforts to diversify. China, in particular, is advancing alternatives to U.S.-dominated financial infrastructure, including expanding renminbi use and promoting the CIPS and mBridge digital currency initiatives. Europe remains largely passive, though there is growing advocacy for \"geofinance\" and the development of a single European capital market and a digital euro. However, these efforts lack the momentum to challenge the dollar\u2019s dominance. Emerging concerns foreshadow potential geopolitical and financial shifts, with Europe vulnerable to U.S. economic control. The debate over gold storage underscores these anxieties, suggesting that once-unthinkable scenarios, like using bullion for political leverage, are now being considered.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":68}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"ft.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search3\ue201","start_idx":10175,"end_idx":10207,"safe_urls":["https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2025/April/English/ch1.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.statestreet.com/ca/en/insights/price-of-protectionism-economic-tradeoffs-of-tariffs?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([imf.org](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2025/April/English/ch1.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [statestreet.com](https://www.statestreet.com/ca/en/insights/price-of-protectionism-economic-tradeoffs-of-tariffs?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] World Economic Outlook, April 2025; Chapter 1: Global Prospects ...","url":"https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2025/April/English/ch1.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1743552000.0,"snippet":"The degree of the surge varies across countries, depending on exposures to protectionist measures through trade and financial linkages as well ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"imf.org"},{"title":"The price of protectionism: Understanding the economic tradeoffs of ...","url":"https://www.statestreet.com/ca/en/insights/price-of-protectionism-economic-tradeoffs-of-tariffs?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"In the long term, however, tariffs have the potential to dampen economic growth.
