As for modified gravity, some theories propose varying speeds for GWs, but these are closely constrained by data. We define key terms: GR (general relativity), QFT (quantum field theory), GW (gravitational wave), and more. The speed of light sets the causal structure.

In other words, genuine gravitational disturbances behave like waves with characteristic surfaces that are null. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search17\ue201\n- Those propagating disturbances are what we call **gravitational waves (GWs)**, and in GR they travel at the vacuum light speed \\(c\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search6\ue201\n\n### Observational check\nThe binary neutron-star merger **GW170817** was seen both in gravitational waves and (about **1.7 s** later) in gamma rays (**GRB 170817A**).

The causal, radiative content still respects the light cone.\n\n### Caveat: modified gravity / effective field theory\nIn some **modified gravity** models or **effective field theories (EFTs)**, the propagation speed of gravitational perturbations can differ from \\(c\\) and can even be mildly superluminal relative to a chosen background metric. Whether that implies true faster-than-light *signaling* depends on which \u201clight cone\u201d matter actually follows and on the theory\u2019s consistency. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search28\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \nBut **within standard GR**, \u201ca localized curvature disturbance outruns light\u201d is not a physical possibility.\n\nIf you tell me what you mean by \u201clocalized curvature\u201d (a moving massive object\u2019s near field? a gravitational-wave packet? expansion of the universe?), I can pin down the precise statement in that context."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search17\ue201","start_idx":605,"end_idx":639,"safe_urls":["https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2002-6","https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2002-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.isgrg.org/YvonneChoquetBruhat100Bieri.pdf","https://www.isgrg.org/YvonneChoquetBruhat100Bieri.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ISGRG](https://www.isgrg.org/YvonneChoquetBruhat100Bieri.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"From the Initial Value Problem for the Einstein Equations to ...","url":"https://www.isgrg.org/YvonneChoquetBruhat100Bieri.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"24 Jan 2024 \u2014 Gravitational waves: Localized disturbances in the geometry propagate at the speed of light, along outgoing null hypersurfaces. source. \uadf8+. \uadf8+.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Theorems on Existence and Global Dynamics for the Einstein ...","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2002-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by AD Rendall \u00b7 2002 \u00b7 Cited by 132 \u2014 The Einstein equations are essentially hyperbolic in nature.
