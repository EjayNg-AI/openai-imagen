The tightest connections appear when you (i) look at **probability measures over trajectories** (MaxEnt\u2019s dynamical extension \u201c**maximum caliber**\u201d), (ii) work in **stochastic or coarse\u2011grained dynamics**, where the **most probable** path minimizes an **action\u2011like rate functional**, and (iii) rotate to **Euclidean (imaginary) time**, where the **action becomes a thermodynamic free\u2011energy** and entropies enter explicitly. But PLA and MaxEnt are *not the same principle*: PLA governs deterministic, often time\u2011reversible dynamics via stationary phase, whereas MaxEnt/MaxCal are inference principles for probability laws given constraints. Below I map the firm bridges, the limits, and a forward\u2011looking synthesis.  \n\n---\n\n## 1) Where the link is rigorous\n\n### A. Path measures: MaxCal \u2192 action weights \u2192 Euler\u2013Lagrange\nJaynes\u2019s **maximum caliber** (MaxCal) maximizes the **path entropy** over all trajectories subject to dynamical constraints. The solution is a **Gibbs measure on paths**,  \n\\[\n\\rho[\\gamma]\\;\\propto\\;\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\sum_k\\int\\lambda_k(t)\\,A_k(\\gamma,t)\\,dt\\Big).\n\\]  \nWhen the constrained path functionals \\(A_k\\) collectively define a Lagrangian \\(L(x,\\dot x,t)\\), this takes the form \\(\\rho[\\gamma]\\propto e^{-\\int L\\,dt}\\). The **mode** (or MAP path) then **extremizes** \\(\\int L\\,dt\\) and obeys the **Euler\u2013Lagrange equations**, recovering PLA as the typical path in the small\u2011noise/MAP limit. This program\u2014and many concrete derivations\u2014are laid out in reviews and case studies of MaxCal. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n### B. Stochastic dynamics: Onsager\u2013Machlup / Large deviations\nFor diffusions \\(dX_t=b(X_t,t)\\,dt+\\sqrt{2D}\\,dW_t\\), the probability of an entire trajectory concentrates as  \n\\[\n\\mathbb P(\\gamma)\\;\\asymp\\;\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{1}{4D}\\int_0^T\\!\\|\\dot x-b(x,t)\\|^2\\,dt\\Big),\n\\]  \nthe **Onsager\u2013Machlup** functional. The **most probable path** minimizes this **action functional**; more generally, Freidlin\u2013Wentzell **large\u2011deviation theory** shows that rare event probabilities are governed by a rate function often interpretable as an action. This is a direct stochastic counterpart of \u201cleast action,\u201d and it ties the weight of a path to an **entropic cost** (a relative entropy; see next item). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn9search0\ue201\n\n### C. Relative entropy as \u201caction\u201d on path space\nIn modern nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, **entropy production** is a **Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL)** divergence between a **forward** and a **time\u2011reversed** **path measure**. Large\u2011deviation rate functions and Onsager\u2013Machlup functionals can be written as\u2014or bounded by\u2014such KLs. Thus, the \u201caction\u201d governing path weights is literally an **information\u2011theoretic distance**. This unifies **PLA\u2011like minimization** with **entropy/KL extremization**. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search10\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search3\ue201\n\n### D. Schr\u00f6dinger bridges & entropic optimal transport (control\u2011as\u2011inference)\nThe **Schr\u00f6dinger bridge** (SB) seeks the **most likely** stochastic flow that transports an initial distribution to a final one, **minimizing KL** to a reference (e.g., Wiener) prior. SB is **entropy\u2011regularized optimal transport**; in small noise it converges to **OT geodesics** (which minimize kinetic action). SB thereby exhibits an explicit **MaxEnt/MaxCal \u21d2 action\u2011minimization** equivalence on path space and has become central in generative modeling and stochastic control. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search3\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn12search2\ue201\n\n### E. Euclidean time: action \u2194 thermodynamic free energy\nIn **imaginary (Euclidean) time**, quantum path integrals weigh paths by \\(\\exp[-S_E/\\hbar]\\), directly analogous to Boltzmann weights; the **Euclidean action \\(S_E\\)** functions like a \\(\\beta F\\). In gravity, the **on\u2011shell Euclidean action** (with proper Gibbons\u2013Hawking boundary terms) computes partition functions and **black\u2011hole entropies/free energies**\u2014a mature, quantitative bridge linking action to thermodynamics/entropy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn4search17\ue201\n\n> **Bottom line:** In each of these settings, an **extremum of an action functional** is simultaneously an **extremum of an (information\u2011theoretic) entropy functional** over paths, after choosing the right prior and constraints.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Where the link is nuanced or limited\n\n- **PLA vs MaxEnt differ in status.** PLA is a **dynamical law** (from Hamilton\u2019s principle) whose real\u2011time path integral counterpart uses **oscillatory phases**; the classical limit emerges by **stationary phase**, not by maximizing a probability. The **probabilistic/entropic** reading requires **stochasticity** or **Euclidean rotation** (or both). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n- **\u201cLeast\u201d vs \u201cstationary.\u201d** PLA is a **stationary** action principle; minima are not guaranteed. Omitting this subtlety blurs distinctions with \u201cmaximization\u201d views. (Standard expositions emphasize \u201cstationary.\u201d) \ue200cite\ue202turn7search7\ue201\n\n- **MEP/MINEP caveats.** The **minimum entropy production** principle (Prigogine) is valid only **near equilibrium** (linear regime); general claims beyond that fail. Conversely, **maximum entropy production (MEP)** has domains of usefulness but remains far from a universal law. Treat both as **heuristics or inference devices**, not bedrock principles. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search6\ue202turn6search14\ue202turn6search1\ue201\n\n- **\u201cFree\u2011energy principle\u201d analogies.** Bayesian/variational \u201cfree\u2011energy\u201d frameworks in neuroscience and complex systems often draw analogies to PLA; the connections are suggestive but under active debate on scope and exactness. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search18\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 3) How the pieces fit together (a compact mathematical skeleton)\n\nLet \\(P\\) be a **prior path measure** (e.g., Wiener measure with diffusion \\(D\\)). Choose **constraints** on path functionals \\(A_k[\\gamma]\\) (energetics, currents, boundary marginals). The **MaxCal/SB** problem is  \n\\[\n\\textbf{maximize}\\quad \\mathcal S(\\rho)= -\\mathrm{KL}(\\rho\\Vert P)\\quad\n\\textbf{subject to}\\ \\ \\mathbb E_\\rho[A_k]=a_k.\n\\]  \nThe solution has density \\(d\\rho^\\star/dP \\propto e^{-\\sum_k \\lambda_k A_k[\\gamma]}\\). If \\(\\sum_k \\lambda_k A_k = \\int_0^T L(x,\\dot x,t)\\,dt\\), then the **MAP** path \\(\\gamma^\\star\\) **extremizes** \\(\\int L\\,dt\\) and satisfies **Euler\u2013Lagrange**. With a diffusion prior, the **rate functional** becomes an **Onsager\u2013Machlup/Freidlin\u2013Wentzell action**, whose minimizers are **most probable trajectories**. In **Euclidean time**, the same weight is a **Boltzmann factor**, hence a **free\u2011energy/entropy** extremum. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn9search6\ue202turn12search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 4) \u201cLatest thinking\u201d snapshots (2024\u20132025)\n\n- **From meso to macro:** New **RMP (2025)** reviews connect **stochastic thermodynamics** for Markov jump/diffusion processes to deterministic macroscopic laws, consolidating KL/entropy\u2011production and large\u2011deviation structure as the bridge between micro paths and macro dynamics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n- **Bridging large deviations and ST directly:** Recent work (2025) forges explicit links between **Freidlin\u2013Wentzell** rate functionals and **entropy production**, sharpening the action\u2013entropy correspondence in nonequilibrium settings. \ue200cite\ue202turn11search0\ue201\n\n- **Schr\u00f6dinger bridges in practice:** Ongoing advances in SB theory/algorithms (2024\u20132025) expand its role across physics and ML, reinforcing the **KL\u2011regularized action minimization** picture of dynamics. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search2\ue202turn12search7\ue201\n\n- **Gravitation:** Fresh analyses of **Euclidean gravitational actions** and black\u2011hole phase structure continue to equate **on\u2011shell action** with **thermodynamic potentials/entropies**, keeping the action\u2013entropy tie operational in high\u2011energy theory. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search5\ue202turn4search13\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 5) My assessment (speculative, but grounded)\n\n**A unified \u201cinference\u2013dynamics\u201d variational principle.** A clean way to view PLA and MaxEnt as two faces of the same coin is to formulate physics on **path space** with a **prior** \\(P\\) encoding symmetries/noise and then **extremize**\n\\[\n\\mathcal{J}(\\rho)=\\mathrm{KL}(\\rho\\Vert P)\\;+\\;\\beta\\,\\mathbb E_\\rho\\!\\Big[\\int_0^T V(x_t,t)\\,dt\\Big]\n\\quad \\text{under boundary/data constraints.}\n\\]\n- In the **small\u2011noise** (or **MAP**) limit: \\(\\rho\\) concentrates, and \\(\\mathcal{J}\\) reduces to an **effective action** \\(S_{\\rm eff}=\\int (K-V)\\,dt\\); **PLA** (Euler\u2013Lagrange) emerges.  \n- At **finite noise/coarse\u2011graining**: the objective is a **relative\u2011entropy\u2011regularized control problem** (SB/control\u2011as\u2011inference), and minimizers are **most\u2011probable flows** with **entropy production** equal to a **KL**.  \n- Under **Euclidean rotation**: \\(S_{\\rm eff}\\) **is** \\(\\beta F\\); extremizing \\(\\mathcal{J}\\) becomes ordinary **free\u2011energy minimization**.  \n\nThis perspective is already explicit in MaxCal, large deviations, SB, and stochastic control literatures; the unification is to **treat mechanics as constrained inference on paths**, with **PLA as the zero\u2011noise limit** and **entropy production as the information\u2011theoretic price of irreversibility**. What is still missing (a worthwhile research program):\n\n1) **Noether\u2011style theorems for inference:** make precise how **symmetries of the prior/constraints** imply **conserved currents** for the **posterior path law** (some steps exist, but a general theory is nascent). \ue200cite\ue202turn10search0\ue201  \n2) **Dissipation and open systems:** a canonical \u201caction\u201d for generic nonequilibrium dynamics that **adds** friction and constraints without ad hoc terms (recent large\u2011deviation/HJB connections are promising). \ue200cite\ue202turn11search2\ue201  \n3) **Quantum, real time:** tighten the bridge between **stationary phase (real time)** and **entropy/KL** beyond the Euclidean trick\u2014i.e., identify when **informational extremals** control **phase interference**. (This is largely open.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 6) Practical takeaways\n\n- If you want PLA to \u201ccome from entropy,\u201d **work on path ensembles** (MaxCal/SB), not single microstates. Then least\u2011action equations reappear as **most\u2011likely** or **MAP** paths given constraints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- In nonequilibrium problems, treat the **action** as a **relative entropy** on path space; then **entropy production** quantifies how \u201ccostly\u201d it is to realize a trajectory\u2014a direct, computable connection now used widely (e.g., single\u2011molecule and active matter). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search7\ue202turn3search13\ue201  \n- In QFT/gravity, **Euclidean methods** make the action/free\u2011energy/entropy equivalence **literal** and quantitatively predictive. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn4search17\ue201\n\n---\n\n## References (selected, recent & foundational)\n\n- **MaxCal & Variational Inference on Paths:** Press\u00e9 et\u202fal., *Rev.

with the right prior and constraints, **least action** emerges as the **MAP/most\u2011probable** trajectory of an **entropy\u2011maximizing** path measure, and entropy production is the **relative\u2011entropy cost** of deviating from the prior dynamics.\n\n---\n\n## Article architecture (12 sections + appendices)\n\n### 1) Abstract (\u2248150\u2013200 words)\n- State the unifying claim succinctly.\n- List three bridges you will establish: (i) MaxCal \u21d2 Euler\u2013Lagrange (MAP limit), (ii) Onsager\u2013Machlup / large deviations \u21d2 action as rate functional/KL, (iii) Euclidean rotation \u21d2 action as free energy.\n- Emphasize scope and limits (stationary vs minimum;
