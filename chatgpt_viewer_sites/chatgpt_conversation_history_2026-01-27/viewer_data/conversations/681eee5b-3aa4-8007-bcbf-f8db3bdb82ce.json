of May 10, 2025, there is significant speculation that U.S. President Donald Trump may announce formal recognition of a Palestinian state during an upcoming Gulf-U.S. summit in Saudi Arabia.\ue204 \ue203A Gulf diplomatic source indicated that Trump plans to declare U.S. recognition of a Palestinian state, contingent upon the exclusion of Hamas from its governance.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203This potential policy shift aligns with Trump's broader Middle East strategy, which includes efforts to expand the Abraham Accords and normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\ue204 \ue203Notably, Trump has reportedly removed the requirement for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel as a precondition for a U.S.-Saudi nuclear agreement, signaling a more flexible approach to regional diplomacy.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203However, Trump's recent proposals concerning Gaza have drawn widespread criticism.\ue204 \ue203In February 2025, he suggested that the U.S. could \"take over\" and redevelop Gaza, envisioning it as the \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" following the displacement of its Palestinian population.\ue204 \ue203This plan was met with strong opposition from Arab nations, international organizations, and human rights groups, who condemned it as a violation of international law and an act of ethnic cleansing.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203While the proposed recognition of a Palestinian state could be seen as a significant development, it is important to note that Trump's vision appears to exclude Hamas and may involve significant alterations to the current territorial and governance structures of Palestinian regions.\ue204 \ue203As such, the implications of this potential policy change remain complex and contentious.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent Developments on Trump's Middle East

ethnic cleansing and a violation of international law\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn0news43\ue201.\ue206\n\n\ue203The anticipated announcement appears to be part of a broader strategy to reshape Middle East dynamics.\ue204 \ue203Trump has reportedly decoupled U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation talks from the requirement of Saudi normalization with Israel, a move that may facilitate closer ties between Washington and Riyadh\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201. \ue203Additionally, discussions are underway regarding a potential U.S.-led transitional governing body in Gaza, aimed at managing the region post-conflict until it is demilitarized and a viable Palestinian administration can take over\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news16\ue201.\ue206\n\n\ue203While the recognition of a Palestinian state without Hamas's involvement may be seen as a step toward resolving longstanding conflicts, it raises questions about the feasibility of excluding a significant political entity from the governance framework.\ue204 \ue203Moreover, the success of such a plan would depend on the cooperation of regional stakeholders and the Palestinian population's acceptance.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203In summary, President Trump's anticipated recognition of a Palestinian state represents a notable shift in U.S. foreign policy.\ue204 \ue203However, the implementation and reception of this policy will be critical in determining its effectiveness in promoting lasting peace in the region.\ue204\ue206

Viewing it as another attempt to normalize extreme measures, the plan has found support from the Israeli far-right, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The proposal, which foresees a permanent displacement of Palestinians and potentially extending to the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and even the Arab population of Israel, has been labeled as ethnic cleansing and a war crime. Forcibly removing people en masse from their homeland is against international laws and judgments upholding Palestinians' rights to self-determination. Despite Trump's portrayal of the plan as benevolent due to Gaza's current devastation (majorly caused by Israeli attacks), the proposal's true nature aims at erasing Palestinian presence. Trump's call for Jordan and Egypt to take in these displaced people has been rejected by those nations due to demographic and economic concerns. Critics argue that Israel, where many Gaza residents originated, or the US should absorb the refugees, though both scenarios seem improbable. Trump's plan undermines his negotiation goals with Palestinian groups and regional allies, who demand a Palestinian state's establishment. Kenneth Roth suggests that pushing for a two-state solution could be a more just and viable approach, potentially earning Trump international recognition for peace efforts.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"Trump Says U.S. Will Take Over Gaza","url":"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/trump-us-gaza-takeover-4bb381e8?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1738724160.0,"snippet":"El presidente Trump ha anunciado durante una conferencia de prensa junto al primer ministro israel\u00ed Benjamin Netanyahu en la Casa Blanca que Estados Unidos tomar\u00e1 el control de la Franja de Gaza y buscar\u00e1 que los casi dos millones de residentes palestinos se trasladen permanentemente a pa\u00edses vecinos.

are underway regarding the potential establishment of a US-led transitional governing body in Gaza, aimed at managing the region post-conflict until it is demilitarised and a viable Palestinian administration can take over. This provisional model is reminiscent of the post-2003 Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and is still in preliminary stages, with no officials named or countries confirmed for participation. Both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority are reportedly excluded from this plan. The idea evokes both criticism and satire, including a viral AI-generated video parodying Donald Trump\u2019s past comments about developing Gaza, which was controversially reposted by Trump's team and sparked widespread debate. While the US insists its approach prioritizes peace and hostage release, Israeli officials propose a transitional trusteeship involving \u201cmoderate Arab countries,\u201d asserting their primary concern is security, not governance. Hamas rejects foreign-imposed leadership, insisting that Gaza\u2019s people must choose their own leaders. Meanwhile, alternative proposals include dividing Gaza into controlled zones and involving international coalitions. The United Arab Emirates, having normalized relations with Israel, has suggested a plan involving the Palestinian Authority and a pathway to statehood, though its stance on a US-led authority excluding the PA remains unclear.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":16}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1619,"end_idx":1620,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Exclusive:

The plan, which includes establishing a new distribution mechanism allegedly independent of Israel and involving private security contractors under the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has been criticized for potentially violating humanitarian principles and causing forced displacement. Currently, Gaza faces extreme shortages of food and other necessities due to an Israeli blockade in place since March, intended to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages and disarming. Aid agencies argue the blockade is a \"starvation tactic\" and could amount to a war crime. The U.N. and other relief groups have rejected the new system, emphasizing the need for the established, neutral delivery networks led by UNRWA, which has the widest reach. Critics also cite the impracticality of the proposed distribution model, which would cover only half the population and exclude northern Gaza. UN and aid representatives maintain that unblocking hundreds of aid trucks daily remains the most effective response to the humanitarian crisis, rather than imposing a politically influenced and restrictive aid mechanism.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746799146.0,"attribution":"AP News"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/gaza-aid-distribution-israel-hamas-8417c39884394656fd5328d4aebdad64","title":"A US-backed group seeks to take over Gaza aid distribution in a ...","snippet":"The Associated Press obtained a proposal from the newly created group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, to implement a new aid distribution ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746771365.375365,"attribution":"AP News"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.latimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-09/un-agencies-warn-israel-plans-for-aid-distribution-endanger-lives-in-gaza","title":"U.N. agencies warn Israel plans for aid distribution endanger lives in ...","snippet":"In its proposal, the Gaza Humanitarian Fund said that it would initially set up four distribution sites, each serving 300,000 people.

While Trump previously played a key role in facilitating a temporary ceasefire through envoy Steve Witkoff, his subsequent lack of interest has left Netanyahu unchecked. The breakdown of the ceasefire, coupled with a worsening humanitarian crisis due to an Israeli aid blockade, has intensified the conflict. Trump's administration, facing challenges on multiple diplomatic fronts including Russia-Ukraine and Iran, has demonstrated a consistent pattern of abandoning negotiations when outcomes are not immediate. A planned Trump tour of the Middle East appears more focused on investment and diplomacy with Gulf states than resolving the Gaza conflict. Meanwhile, U.S. diplomatic retreats, including budget cuts and reduced roles, have further diminished its influence.

Currently, Gaza faces extreme shortages of food and other necessities due to an Israeli blockade in place since March, intended to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages and disarming. Aid agencies argue the blockade is a \"starvation tactic\" and could amount to a war crime. The U.N. and other relief groups have rejected the new system, emphasizing the need for the established, neutral delivery networks led by UNRWA, which has the widest reach. Critics also cite the impracticality of the proposed distribution model, which would cover only half the population and exclude northern Gaza.

The plan, which includes establishing a new distribution mechanism allegedly independent of Israel and involving private security contractors under the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has been criticized for potentially violating humanitarian principles and causing forced displacement. Currently, Gaza faces extreme shortages of food and other necessities due to an Israeli blockade in place since March, intended to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages and disarming. Aid agencies argue the blockade is a \"starvation tactic\" and could amount to a war crime. The U.N. and other relief groups have rejected the new system, emphasizing the need for the established, neutral delivery networks led by UNRWA, which has the widest reach. Critics also cite the impracticality of the proposed distribution model, which would cover only half the population and exclude northern Gaza. UN and aid representatives maintain that unblocking hundreds of aid trucks daily remains the most effective response to the humanitarian crisis, rather than imposing a politically influenced and restrictive aid mechanism.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AP News"},{"title":"UN agencies warn that Israel's plans for aid distribution will endanger lives in Gaza","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/09/gaza-aid-israel-distribution-plan-un/e51ceb52-2cdd-11f0-a724-3bc879c9f843_story.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746850572.004423,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Washington Post"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news35\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":2963,"end_idx":2994,"safe_urls":["https://www.axios.com/2025/05/09/uae-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-israel?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/09/gaza-aid-trump-plan-huckabee/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/09/uae-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-israel?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/09/gaza-aid-trump-plan-huckabee/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Scoop: UAE tells Israel it won't work with new Gaza aid mechanism \"as it stands\"","url":"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/09/uae-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-israel?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746812954.0,"snippet":"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has informed Israel that it will not participate in the new Gaza aid mechanism in its current form, a setback for the initiative supported by Israel and the U.S. intended to deliver humanitarian aid while keeping it out of Hamas' control.

While Trump previously played a key role in facilitating a temporary ceasefire through envoy Steve Witkoff, his subsequent lack of interest has left Netanyahu unchecked. The breakdown of the ceasefire, coupled with a worsening humanitarian crisis due to an Israeli aid blockade, has intensified the conflict. Trump's administration, facing challenges on multiple diplomatic fronts including Russia-Ukraine and Iran, has demonstrated a consistent pattern of abandoning negotiations when outcomes are not immediate. A planned Trump tour of the Middle East appears more focused on investment and diplomacy with Gulf states than resolving the Gaza conflict. Meanwhile, U.S. diplomatic retreats, including budget cuts and reduced roles, have further diminished its influence. Trump's rhetoric has provided political cover for hardline Israeli officials advocating for extreme measures in Gaza, thereby reinforcing a cycle of escalation and undermining hopes for a peaceful resolution.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search0\ue201","start_idx":3484,"end_idx":3516,"safe_urls":["https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-riviera-of-the-middle-east-plan-fundamentally-misreads-the-arab-world/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5287576/trump-gaza-takeover?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5287576/trump-gaza-takeover?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-riviera-of-the-middle-east-plan-fundamentally-misreads-the-arab-world/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Unpacking Trump's ideas for taking over the Gaza Strip - NPR","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5287576/trump-gaza-takeover?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1738713600.0,"snippet":"President Trump floated two bombshell ideas Tuesday about Gaza that has Palestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East scrambling.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"NPR"},{"title":"Trump's 'Riviera of the Middle East' Plan Fundamentally Misreads ...","url":"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-riviera-of-the-middle-east-plan-fundamentally-misreads-the-arab-world/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1740528000.0,"snippet":"Trump's dangerous proposal to turn Gaza into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d represents a troubling call for ethnic cleansing and fundamentally misreads the ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Center for American Progress"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201","start_idx":3728,"end_idx":3760,"safe_urls":["https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-853387?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1p6o5ogxg?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-853387?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ynetnews](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1p6o5ogxg?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Will the United States recognize 'Palestine' under Donald Trump?","url":"https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-853387?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746832565.858816,"snippet":"Gulf diplomatic source claims Trump will announce US recognition of Palestinian state.

The plan, which includes establishing a new distribution mechanism allegedly independent of Israel and involving private security contractors under the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has been criticized for potentially violating humanitarian principles and causing forced displacement. Currently, Gaza faces extreme shortages of food and other necessities due to an Israeli blockade in place since March, intended to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages and disarming. Aid agencies argue the blockade is a \"starvation tactic\" and could amount to a war crime. The U.N. and other relief groups have rejected the new system, emphasizing the need for the established, neutral delivery networks led by UNRWA, which has the widest reach. Critics also cite the impracticality of the proposed distribution model, which would cover only half the population and exclude northern Gaza. UN and aid representatives maintain that unblocking hundreds of aid trucks daily remains the most effective response to the humanitarian crisis, rather than imposing a politically influenced and restrictive aid mechanism.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AP News"},{"title":"Aid groups voice alarm as US pushes Israeli plan for Gaza assistance","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/gaza-israeli-aid-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746800165.370172,"snippet":"Under the auspices of a newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is based in Geneva, aid would be delivered to four \u201chubs ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1search9\ue201","start_idx":5786,"end_idx":5818,"safe_urls":["https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5141201-israel-intercepts-missile-launched-yemen?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-israel-discuss-possible-us-led-administration-gaza-sources-say-2025-05-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-israel-discuss-possible-us-led-administration-gaza-sources-say-2025-05-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Asharq Al-Awsat](https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5141201-israel-intercepts-missile-launched-yemen?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Exclusive: US, Israel discuss possible US-led administration for ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-israel-discuss-possible-us-led-administration-gaza-sources-say-2025-05-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746598565.862483,"snippet":"Summary.
