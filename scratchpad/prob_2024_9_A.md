# Proposed approaches to the Problem by the problem solver

## Problem_restatement
Given \(A>0\) and \(B=(3+2\sqrt2)A=(1+\sqrt2)^2A\), consider the finite list
\[
a_k=\Big\lfloor \frac{k}{\sqrt2}\Big\rfloor\qquad (k\in(A,B)\cap\mathbb Z).
\]
Show that among the values \(\{a_k\}\), the count of even integers and the count of odd integers differ by at most \(2\).

Equivalently, show that
\[
\left|\sum_{k\in(A,B)\cap\mathbb Z} (-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}\right|\le 2.
\]

## Assumptions or clarifications
- Interpret \((A,B)\cap\mathbb Z\) as all integers \(k\) with \(A<k<B\). (Endpoints excluded.)
- If \((A,B)\cap\mathbb Z\) is empty or has very few elements, the claim is trivially true.
- No integrality assumptions on \(A\) are given, so any argument should handle arbitrary real \(A>0\).

## Approaches

### Approach 1 (Index 1): **Sturmian/rotation model + bounded discrepancy**
**High-level idea.**  
The parity sequence \(p_k:=\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor \bmod 2\) is (up to simple transformations) a coding of an irrational rotation, hence a Sturmian/mechanical word. A key property of Sturmian words is *balance*: for any block of consecutive indices, the discrepancy in counts of symbols is uniformly bounded (often by \(1\)). Translating “even vs odd values” into a two-symbol coding, we aim to prove that the discrepancy over any block of consecutive \(k\)’s is bounded by an absolute constant; then the specific block \((A,B)\cap\mathbb Z\) automatically has discrepancy \(\le 2\).

**Detailed plan.**
1. Reformulate the target as a bound on the signed sum
   \[
   S(A):=\sum_{k\in(A,B)\cap\mathbb Z} \chi(k),\qquad \chi(k):=(-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}.
   \]
2. Express \(\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor\) in terms of a rotation:
   write \(\alpha:=1/\sqrt2\). Then \(\lfloor k\alpha\rfloor\) is the integer part of \(k\alpha\), and the “jump sequence”
   \[
   d_k := \lfloor (k+1)\alpha\rfloor - \lfloor k\alpha\rfloor \in\{0,1\}
   \]
   is a standard Sturmian word (mechanical word with slope \(\alpha\)).
3. Observe \(\lfloor k\alpha\rfloor = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i\), so the parity of \(\lfloor k\alpha\rfloor\) is the parity of a prefix sum of a Sturmian word. One can try to convert \(\chi(k)\) into a coding of a rotation as well (e.g. via a 2-step automaton on the Sturmian word).
4. Use known balance/discrepancy statements for Sturmian sequences (or prove a tailored version): show that for any interval of consecutive indices \([m,n)\),
   \[
   \left|\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} \chi(k)\right|\le C
   \]
   for a small absolute constant \(C\) (ideally \(C=1\) or \(2\)).
5. Conclude for \((A,B)\cap\mathbb Z\), which is a consecutive block of integers, hence covered by the bound.

**Required tools or theorems.**
- Sturmian/mechanical words and balance property.
- Coding of irrational rotations; discrepancy bounds for rotations.
- Basic facts about \(\alpha=1/\sqrt2\) (continued fraction \([0;1,2,2,\dots]\)) if one proves balance directly.

**Main obstacles.**
- The parity-of-floor sequence \(\chi(k)=(-1)^{\lfloor k\alpha\rfloor}\) is not the *standard* Sturmian coding \(\mathbf 1_{\{k\alpha\}\in I}\); it is a parity of a cumulative count. One needs either:
  - a known lemma that such derived sequences remain balanced with bounded discrepancy, or
  - an explicit conversion to a rotation on a larger state space (a 2-interval exchange / 2-step skew product).
- Ensuring the constant is indeed \(\le 2\) (not merely \(O(1)\)).

**Expected difficulty.** High (unless one already knows the relevant Sturmian-balance lemma for this derived sequence).

**Estimated viability score.** 70/100.

**Notes on similarity to other approaches.** Distinct in style; others use explicit algebraic self-similarity rather than general Sturmian theory.

---

### Approach 2 (Index 2): **Self-similarity from the unit \(1+\sqrt2\) and pairing/cancellation**
**High-level idea.**  
The scaling factor \(3+2\sqrt2=(1+\sqrt2)^2\) strongly suggests using the Pell-unit \(u:=1+\sqrt2\). There is a “near-conjugacy” identity
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{u k}{\sqrt2}\right\rfloor=\left\lfloor k\left(1+\frac1{\sqrt2}\right)\right\rfloor
= k + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{\sqrt2}\right\rfloor
\]
(since \(k\) is an integer), yielding a clean parity relation:
\[
(-1)^{\lfloor uk/\sqrt2\rfloor} = (-1)^k\,(-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}.
\]
If we can (almost) bijectively map integers \(k\in(A,uA)\) to integers \(k'\in(uA,u^2A)\) via \(k'\approx uk\) (e.g. \(k'=\lfloor uk\rfloor\) or \(\lceil uk\rceil\)), then the above parity relation forces massive cancellation between contributions from the two halves of \((A,u^2A)\). Only boundary mismatches can remain, plausibly giving the “\(\le 2\)” error.

**Detailed plan.**
1. Set \(u=1+\sqrt2\), so \(B=u^2A\). Split the integer interval into two consecutive subintervals:
   \[
   (A,u^2A) = (A,uA)\ \cup\ (uA,u^2A).
   \]
2. Define a map from integers in the first part to (almost all) integers in the second part:
   - candidate: \(\phi(k)=\lfloor uk\rfloor\), which should satisfy \(uA<\phi(k)<u^2A\) for \(A<k<uA\), except possibly for \(O(1)\) values near the endpoints.
3. Prove \(\phi\) is injective and its image misses at most \(O(1)\) integers in \((uA,u^2A)\). (This uses monotonicity and the fact \(u\) is irrational, so \(\lfloor uk\rfloor\) increases by 1 or 2 with controlled behavior.)
4. Compare \(\lfloor \phi(k)/\sqrt2\rfloor\) with \(\lfloor uk/\sqrt2\rfloor\):
   since \(\phi(k)\) differs from \(uk\) by \(<1\), their quotients differ by \(<1/\sqrt2\), so floors differ by at most \(1\). Track how this affects parity; show it only introduces a bounded number of “bad” \(k\)’s where parity doesn’t match the clean identity.
5. Use the exact identity
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{u k}{\sqrt2}\right\rfloor = k + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{\sqrt2}\right\rfloor
   \]
   to deduce a parity relation between \(\lfloor uk/\sqrt2\rfloor\) and \(\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor\).
6. Transfer this relation to \(\lfloor \phi(k)/\sqrt2\rfloor\) for the paired terms in the second subinterval, obtaining cancellation in
   \(\sum_{k\in(A,u^2A)\cap\mathbb Z} (-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}\),
   leaving only a bounded boundary error (target \(\le 2\)).
7. Conclude that the even/odd counts differ by at most that boundary error.

**Required tools or theorems.**
- Basic floor-function inequalities: if \(|x-y|<1\) then \(\lfloor x\rfloor\) and \(\lfloor y\rfloor\) differ by at most \(1\).
- Irrationality of \(u\) to control the map \(k\mapsto \lfloor uk\rfloor\).
- Possibly a standard “Beatty-type” counting lemma about images of \(\lfloor uk\rfloor\) on intervals.

**Main obstacles.**
- Making the “almost bijection” precise with a *small* explicit error bound (so the final discrepancy is \(\le 2\), not just \(O(1)\)).
- Controlling parity changes when replacing \(uk\) by \(\lfloor uk\rfloor\).

**Expected difficulty.** Medium–High.

**Estimated viability score.** 85/100.

**Notes on similarity to other approaches.** Related in spirit to substitution/Beatty methods (Approach 3), but more direct via an explicit pairing/cancellation using the unit \(u\).

---

### Approach 3 (Index 3): **Beatty/difference sequence viewpoint + substitution invariance for \(\sqrt2\)**
**High-level idea.**  
Instead of looking at \(\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor\) as \(k\) varies, invert the relation: for each integer \(m\), the set of \(k\) such that \(\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor=m\) is the set of integers in \([m\sqrt2,(m+1)\sqrt2)\), which contains either 1 or 2 integers. Thus the multiplicity
\[
d_m := \#\{k\in\mathbb Z : \lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor=m\} = \lfloor (m+1)\sqrt2\rfloor-\lfloor m\sqrt2\rfloor \in\{1,2\}
\]
is a Sturmian (difference) word with strong self-similarity (linked to the continued fraction of \(\sqrt2\)). Then the even–odd discrepancy in the multiset \(\{a_k\}\) over \(k\in(A,B)\) becomes a signed sum \(\sum (-1)^m d_m\) over an \(m\)-interval, plus boundary truncation. The special scaling \(B=u^2A\) should align the \(m\)-interval with a substitution structure, giving bounded signed sum and hence discrepancy \(\le 2\).

**Detailed plan.**
1. Let \(K=(A,B)\cap\mathbb Z\). The multiset of values \(\{a_k:k\in K\}\) counts each \(m\) with multiplicity
   \[
   n_m := \#\{k\in K: \lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor=m\},
   \]
   which equals \(d_m\) for “interior” \(m\)’s and differs only near the ends (at most 2 boundary \(m\)’s).
2. Express the discrepancy as
   \[
   \Delta = \sum_m (-1)^m n_m,
   \]
   and split \(\Delta\) into:
   - an interior sum \(\sum_{m=M}^{N} (-1)^m d_m\),
   - plus boundary corrections of size \(\le 2\).
3. Study the word \(d_m\in\{1,2\}\). Write \(d_m=1+e_m\) with \(e_m\in\{0,1\}\) a Sturmian word of slope \(\{\sqrt2\}=\sqrt2-1\).
4. Use substitution invariance of the slope \(\sqrt2-1\) (silver ratio dynamics) to show that signed sums \(\sum (-1)^m d_m\) over blocks whose lengths correspond to the unit \(u^2\) have bounded value (often obtained by analyzing the substitution matrix and tracking a signed weight).
5. Translate the scaling \(k\in(A,u^2A)\) into the corresponding \(m\)-range (approximately \((A/\sqrt2,u^2A/\sqrt2)\)) and show it matches a “substitution block” up to bounded error, hence the signed sum is bounded.
6. Add the boundary correction (already \(\le 2\)) to finish.

**Required tools or theorems.**
- Beatty/difference word identity \(d_m=\lfloor (m+1)\sqrt2\rfloor-\lfloor m\sqrt2\rfloor\in\{1,2\}\).
- Sturmian substitution for the silver ratio (\(\sqrt2-1\)) / continued fraction \([0;2,2,2,\dots]\).
- Basic substitution-matrix/eigenvalue analysis to control signed weights.

**Main obstacles.**
- Precisely relating the \(k\)-interval scaling by \(u^2\) to an \(m\)-block where substitution cancellation applies (keeping an explicit error \(\le 2\)).
- Carrying the alternating sign \((-1)^m\) through the substitution system cleanly.

**Expected difficulty.** High.

**Estimated viability score.** 75/100.

**Notes on similarity to other approaches.** Similar “self-similarity” theme to Approach 2, but implemented via multiplicities \(d_m\) and substitution/Beatty structure rather than direct pairing of \(k\)’s.

---

## Overall recommendation
**Recommended approach indices:** [2, 1]

**Rationale.**  
Approach 2 directly exploits the conspicuous algebraic factor \(B=(1+\sqrt2)^2A\) and produces a plausible explicit involution/pairing that can yield a very small final error (compatible with “\(\le 2\)”). If the pairing can be made tight at the endpoints, it should give the cleanest proof. Approach 1 is a robust backup: once you manage to model the parity sequence as a rotation coding with bounded discrepancy, the desired bound becomes a standard “balance” estimate.

# Expert evaluator's assessment and feedback on the proposed approaches

## 2. Global assessment

The proposed approaches correctly recognize that the factor \(3+2\sqrt2=(1+\sqrt2)^2\) is the key structural feature and that some form of self-similarity/irrational-rotation structure should be exploited. Approach 2 is the most “on-theme” for this particular statement because it attempts to turn the Pell-unit identity into a cancellation mechanism with an explicitly bounded boundary error, which is exactly the type of phenomenon that can produce a uniform constant bound like \(2\). Approach 3 is also plausible but seems heavier: it introduces a second layer (multiplicities in the inverse map) and then requires a nontrivial signed substitution analysis. Approach 1 has the right general vocabulary (rotation/Sturmian ideas) but, as written, appears to be aiming for a uniform bounded-discrepancy property over *all* intervals of consecutive \(k\), which is not justified and is very likely false for this particular parity sequence without using the special scaling \(B=(1+\sqrt2)^2A\). Overall, the set of approaches is promising, but some critical technical gaps—especially in Approach 2’s “almost bijection” story—need to be repaired for a \(\le 2\) bound.

**Overall viability score (0–100): 72**

**Key global concerns:**
- Several steps rely (explicitly or implicitly) on “bounded discrepancy for any interval” heuristics that are not automatically true for \((-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}\) without exploiting the special ratio \(B/A=(1+\sqrt2)^2\).
- Achieving the *sharp constant* “at most \(2\)” requires very tight endpoint/boundary bookkeeping; “\(O(1)\)” arguments will not be enough.
- Approach 2’s proposed integer pairing via \(\phi(k)=\lfloor uk\rfloor\) is not close to a bijection in cardinality, so the cancellation mechanism needs a more careful grouping/covering argument.

---

## 3. Addressing assumptions or clarifications

- **Interpretation of \((A,B)\cap\mathbb Z\) as \(A<k<B\):** Correct and standard; excluding endpoints is consistent with the statement.
- **If the set is empty or very small:** Yes. If there are \(0,1,2\) terms, the even–odd difference is \(\le 2\) trivially. In a polished proof, it’s enough to say “assume there are at least 3 integers in the interval; otherwise immediate.”
- **No integrality assumptions on \(A\):** Correct. Any approach must translate \((A,B)\cap\mathbb Z\) into a consecutive integer block \(\{m,m+1,\dots,n\}\) with \(m=\lfloor A\rfloor+1\), \(n=\lceil B\rceil-1\), and then track how the dependence on the fractional parts of \(A,B\) affects boundary terms. This is exactly where the “\(\le 2\)” constant will come from, so it cannot be ignored.

---

## 4. Per-approach feedback

### Approach 1: Sturmian/rotation model + bounded discrepancy

**Viability score (0–100): 35**

**Strengths**
- Correctly reframes the goal as bounding a signed sum \(\sum (-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}\), which is the right invariant to look at.
- Recognizes that \(\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor\) is generated by an irrational rotation/Beatty-type mechanism, so tools from symbolic dynamics/discrepancy could apply.

**Weaknesses**
- The plan implicitly targets a statement of the form  
  \[
  \left|\sum_{k=m}^{n-1}(-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}\right|\le C\quad\text{for all }m<n,
  \]
  i.e. *uniform bounded discrepancy for all blocks*. For this particular parity sequence, such a universal bound is not established by “Sturmian balance” in any straightforward way and is very likely false unless one uses special lengths/structures. (The parity-of-floor sequence is **not** the standard Sturmian mechanical word \( \lfloor (k+1)\alpha\rfloor-\lfloor k\alpha\rfloor\); it is a different observable.)
- Step 3 highlights an important obstacle (“parity of a prefix sum of a Sturmian word”), but the proposed resolution is vague: balance of \(d_k\) does not automatically control parity of its prefix sums with a constant error.
- Most importantly, this approach does not visibly exploit the *special* choice \(B=(1+\sqrt2)^2A\). If one could prove a universal bound for all intervals, the problem would not need that special ratio at all—which is a warning sign.

**Severity flags:** conceptual mismatch; missing critical subproblem.

**Suggested refinements**
- Replace the global “any interval” discrepancy goal with a lemma tailored to the **specific** dilated interval length/structure induced by \(u^2=(1+\sqrt2)^2\). Concretely: prove boundedness only for blocks \((A,u^2A)\cap\mathbb Z\), not arbitrary \([m,n)\).
- If you insist on symbolic dynamics, explicitly model \((-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}\) as a **skew product** over the rotation generating \(d_k\), i.e. a 2-state automaton driven by the Sturmian word \(d_k\). Then formulate the needed estimate as a cocycle sum bound over a “renormalization time” given by the substitution associated with \(\sqrt2\).
- Identify (and prove) the precise “renormalization” lemma: how the sum over \((A,u^2A)\) relates to a sum over a smaller scale plus an explicit boundary term. Without an explicit renormalization identity, this approach will stall.

---

### Approach 2: Self-similarity from the unit \(1+\sqrt2\) and pairing/cancellation

**Viability score (0–100): 78**

**Strengths**
- This approach uses the most conspicuous and likely essential structure: \(u=1+\sqrt2\) and \(u^2=3+2\sqrt2\), matching the given ratio \(B/A\).
- The identity
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{uk}{\sqrt2}\right\rfloor = k + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{\sqrt2}\right\rfloor
  \]
  is exact and extremely powerful for parity. This is the right kind of “Pell-unit conjugacy” that can create systematic cancellation.
- The approach aims for a “pairing + boundary error” mechanism, which is exactly what a sharp constant bound \(\le 2\) typically comes from.

**Weaknesses**
- The proposed “almost bijection” \(\phi(k)=\lfloor uk\rfloor\) between integers in \((A,uA)\) and \((uA,u^2A)\) is **not** close to a bijection in cardinality. The second interval contains about \(u\) times as many integers as the first (asymptotically), so you cannot pair them one-to-one without leaving a linear number of unpaired terms. This is a serious structural issue in the plan as currently written.
- Relatedly, Step 3 (“image misses at most \(O(1)\) integers”) cannot be true: the image size is roughly \((u-1)A\) while the target interval size is roughly \((u^2-u)A=u(u-1)A\), so the miss is \(\asymp A\), not \(O(1)\).
- Step 4’s “floors differ by at most 1 hence parity errors bounded” is too optimistic: even if each paired element has a parity relation with a possible \(\pm 1\) floor shift, you still need a mechanism ensuring that the *total* number of such “bad shifts” is uniformly bounded, not proportional to the number of pairs.

**Severity flags:** logical error; missing critical subproblem.

**Suggested refinements**
- Abandon the idea of a near-bijection \((A,uA)\cap\mathbb Z \to (uA,u^2A)\cap\mathbb Z\). Instead, use the fact that the real map \(x\mapsto ux\) is a bijection of intervals and **group integers in the second interval into blocks associated to successive integers in the first interval**:
  - For each integer \(k\in(A,uA)\), consider the set  
    \[
    J_k := \bigl(\,uk,\;u(k+1)\,\bigr)\cap\mathbb Z,
    \]
    which has size \(2\) or \(3\) because \(u\in(2,3)\).
  - Try to prove a local cancellation identity for \(\sum_{j\in J_k}(-1)^{\lfloor j/\sqrt2\rfloor}\) in terms of \((-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}\) (possibly with a factor \((-1)^k\)) plus a **uniform** error.
- Make the renormalization explicit: aim for a statement like  
  \[
  S(A):=\sum_{A<k<u^2A}(-1)^{\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor}
  = \pm S(A') + E,
  \]
  where \(A'\) is some simple function of \(A\) (often \(A' \approx uA\) or \(A/u\)) and \(|E|\le 2\). This kind of recursive relation is exactly what Pell units tend to give.
- When replacing \(uk\) by an integer \(j\), do not just say “floors differ by at most 1”; explicitly characterize when  
  \(\lfloor uk/\sqrt2\rfloor = \lfloor j/\sqrt2\rfloor\)  
  or differs by \(1\), in terms of fractional parts. Then show that the number of “mismatching” \(k\) is controlled by **endpoint effects only**.
- Keep a sharp boundary ledger from the start: write the integer set as \(\{m,\dots,n\}\) and show the discrepancy bound reduces to controlling at most two “partial blocks” near endpoints.

---

### Approach 3: Beatty/difference sequence viewpoint + substitution invariance for \(\sqrt2\)

**Viability score (0–100): 66**

**Strengths**
- The inversion step (counting \(k\) via the multiplicity of each \(m=\lfloor k/\sqrt2\rfloor\)) is mathematically natural and often simplifies parity questions, because the multiplicity word \(d_m\in\{1,2\}\) for \(\sqrt2\) has strong structure.
- It correctly anticipates that only \(O(1)\) boundary terms arise when passing from the full multiplicities \(d_m\) to the truncated multiplicities \(n_m\) coming from a finite \(k\)-interval. This boundary localization is compatible with the desired constant “2”.
- The use of substitution/continued fraction structure for \(\sqrt2\) is very plausible, since \(\sqrt2\) is quadratic irrational and thus enjoys exact renormalization properties.

**Weaknesses**
- The hardest part is Step 4/5: controlling an **alternating-sign** sum \(\sum (-1)^m d_m\) via substitution invariance. Substitutions for Sturmian words control *unweighted* counts very well, but the \((-1)^m\) weight is sensitive to the parity of positions, which substitutions can scramble unless you track parity as an extra state.
- The link between the \(k\)-interval scaling by \(u^2\) and a “clean” \(m\)-block on which substitution cancellation is exact is not established. Without a precise lemma connecting the endpoints in \(k\)-space to endpoints in \(m\)-space (with explicit \(O(1)\) error), you risk losing the sharp constant.
- This approach may become technically heavy (substitution matrices, eigenvectors, and parity automata) compared to what the problem likely expects.

**Severity flags:** missing critical subproblem.

**Suggested refinements**
- Promote parity to part of the symbolic system: instead of analyzing \(d_m\) alone, analyze the **2-lift** \((d_m, m\bmod 2)\), i.e. a substitution (or S-adic) system on a 4-letter alphabet tracking both the increment and the parity of the index. This is the minimal framework needed to handle \((-1)^m\) weights cleanly.
- Isolate a concrete lemma: “For the \(\sqrt2\) difference word \(d_m\), the alternating sum over a substitution block of level \(t\) equals \(0\) (or \(\pm1\))” and prove it by induction on the substitution level using the substitution matrix extended by parity.
- When translating the \(k\)-interval \((A,u^2A)\) to an \(m\)-interval, explicitly define  
  \(m_{\min}=\bigl\lfloor (A+1)/\sqrt2\bigr\rfloor\) and  
  \(m_{\max}=\bigl\lfloor (B-1)/\sqrt2\bigr\rfloor\),  
  and show that the truncation affects at most two \(m\)’s (or at most two *blocks*). This is essential to keep the final constant at \(2\).
- If you can’t get exact cancellation, aim for a recursive bound with contraction given by the Galois conjugate \(3-2\sqrt2\), which is \(<1\); that often yields uniform boundedness for quadratic irrational renormalizations.

---

## 5. Recommended approaches

**Recommended approach indices: 2, 3**

**Recommendation rationale:**  
Approach 2 is the best starting point because it leverages an *exact* floor identity coming from the fundamental unit \(u=1+\sqrt2\), and exact identities are what typically deliver sharp bounded-error statements like “difference \(\le 2\)”. However, it must be corrected: the intended cancellation cannot rest on an “almost bijection” between the two scaled subintervals, since their integer cardinalities differ by a factor of about \(u\). The right repair is to group integers in \((uA,u^2A)\) into short blocks tied to consecutive integers in \((A,uA)\), and then show uniform cancellation per block plus at most two partial blocks at the ends. If Approach 2 stalls specifically on controlling the parity effect of rounding \(uk\) to nearby integers, Approach 3 becomes the natural fallback because it relocates the analysis to the multiplicity word \(d_m\in\{1,2\}\), where quadratic-irrational substitution/renormalization is more standard. Approach 3 is heavier, but it offers a systematic way to make “renormalization + bounded boundary error” rigorous by lifting to a parity-tracking substitution. Approach 1 is least recommended because, as currently framed, it appears to chase a global bounded-discrepancy property that does not obviously hold and does not visibly use the special scaling \(B=(1+\sqrt2)^2A\) that the problem is built around.
