# Problem statement

Is it true that, for all $k \ge 1$,

# Proposed approaches to the Problem by the problem solver

## Problem_restatement

Let \(p_k\) be the \(k\)-th prime and \(L(n)=\operatorname{lcm}(1,2,\dots,n)\). The question asks whether for every \(k\ge 1\),
\[
L(p_{k+1}-1)\;<\; p_k\,L(p_k).
\]
Equivalently, whether the “extra growth” of the lcm from \(p_k\) up to just before the next prime is always less than a multiplicative factor \(p_k\).

## Assumptions or clarifications

None.

## Approaches

### **Approach 1 (Index 1): Prime-power “jump factor” reformulation + prime-gap control (conditional route)**

**Name:** Reduce to prime powers inside the prime gap; control them via prime-gap bounds (e.g. Cramér/Legendre-type).

**High-level idea:**

A key observation is that \(L(n)\) only changes when you pass a prime power threshold. Between consecutive primes \(p_k < p_{k+1}\), there are no primes, so \(L(p_{k+1}-1)\) differs from \(L(p_k)\) only because some *prime powers* \(q^a\) (with \(a\ge 2\)) might lie in \((p_k,\,p_{k+1}-1]\).

Moreover, by Bertrand’s postulate \(p_{k+1}<2p_k\), so for any fixed prime \(q\), you cannot cross *two* successive powers \(q^a\) and \(q^{a+1}\) in that short multiplicative window; hence each contributing prime \(q\) appears at most once. This makes the ratio
\[
\frac{L(p_{k+1}-1)}{L(p_k)}
\]
a **squarefree product** of certain primes \(q\), namely those for which the next prime power \(q^{a(q)}\) falls into the prime gap.

Then the inequality becomes a clean statement:
\[
\prod_{\substack{q\ \text{prime}\\ \exists a\ge 2:\ p_k<q^a<p_{k+1}}} q \;<\; p_k.
\]
The “dangerous” case is when there are **several prime squares** \(q^2\) in the gap, because each such \(q\) is \(\gtrsim \sqrt{p_k}\), and two such factors already force the product \(\ge p_k\). This is exactly the obstruction Erdős–Graham mention. 

So one natural strategy is: prove strong enough upper bounds on prime gaps so that (eventually) there is at most one prime square between consecutive primes, and similarly control higher powers and small primes.

**Detailed plan:**

1. **Write \(L(n)\) in prime-power form**:
   \[
   L(n)=\prod_{q\le n} q^{\lfloor \log_q n\rfloor},
   \]
   or equivalently \(\log L(n)=\psi(n)\) (Chebyshev’s \(\psi\)-function). 

2. **Compare exponents at \(n=p_k\) and \(n=p_{k+1}-1\)**:
   for each prime \(q\le p_k\), the exponent increases by
   \[
   \lfloor \log_q (p_{k+1}-1)\rfloor - \lfloor \log_q(p_k)\rfloor.
   \]

3. **Use Bertrand’s postulate** (\(p_{k+1}<2p_k\)) to show:
   - for any \(q\ge 2\), \((p_k,p_{k+1}-1]\subset(p_k,2p_k)\) cannot contain two consecutive powers \(q^a, q^{a+1}\),
   - hence the exponent jump for each \(q\) is either \(0\) or \(1\),
   - thus
     \[
     \frac{L(p_{k+1}-1)}{L(p_k)}=\prod_{q\in S_k} q
     \]
     for a certain set \(S_k\) of primes.

4. **Reformulate the target inequality** as:
   \[
   \prod_{q\in S_k} q < p_k.
   \]

5. **Split \(S_k\) by the relevant exponent \(a\):**
   define
   \[
   S_k(a)=\{q:\ q^a\in(p_k,p_{k+1})\},
   \]
   so \(S_k=\bigcup_{a\ge 2} S_k(a)\) (disjoint in \(q\), since only one exponent jump can occur per prime \(q\)).

6. **Control squares \(a=2\)**:
   \(q^2\in(p_k,p_{k+1})\) means \(q\in(\sqrt{p_k},\sqrt{p_{k+1}})\).
   If you can show \(\sqrt{p_{k+1}}-\sqrt{p_k}<1\), then there is at most one integer in that interval, hence at most one prime \(q\), hence at most one prime square in the gap. This is a prime-gap condition \(p_{k+1}-p_k < \sqrt{p_k}+\sqrt{p_{k+1}}\sim 2\sqrt{p_k}\), i.e. “Legendre-flavored”.

7. **Control higher powers \(a\ge 3\)** similarly:
   \(q^a\in(p_k,p_{k+1})\) means \(q\in(p_k^{1/a},p_{k+1}^{1/a})\). These root-intervals are much shorter than the square-root one.

8. **Handle “small primes trouble”:**
   for small \(q\) (2,3,5,…) the next power can be relatively close; you’d need a careful case split (e.g. show only finitely many \(k\) allow simultaneously \(2^m,3^n,5^r,\dots\) in one prime gap in a way that makes \(\prod q\ge p_k\)).

9. **Conclude under a strong prime-gap hypothesis**:
   if you assume a conjecture like Cramér’s bound \(p_{k+1}-p_k = O((\log p_k)^2)\), then \(\sqrt{p_{k+1}}-\sqrt{p_k}=O((\log p_k)^2/\sqrt{p_k})\to 0\), so eventually there are no prime squares in gaps at all, and higher powers are even easier; one would then finish by checking finitely many small \(k\) computationally.

**Required tools or theorems:**

- Prime-power formula for \(\operatorname{lcm}(1,\dots,n)\), Chebyshev \(\psi\) function identity \(\log L(n)=\psi(n)\).   
- Bertrand’s postulate \(p_{k+1}<2p_k\).  
- Prime-gap conjectures or strong bounds (Legendre-type, Cramér-type) if aiming for a full proof.  
- Careful elementary handling of small bases (2,3,5,…) where many powers exist.

**Main obstacles:**

- The core obstacle is ruling out “too many” primes \(q\) with \(p_k<q^2<p_{k+1}\); Erdős–Graham explicitly highlight this as a major barrier and link it to Legendre-type difficulty.   
- Existing unconditional prime-gap bounds are far too weak to force \(\sqrt{p_{k+1}}-\sqrt{p_k}<1\) uniformly.
- Even if squares are controlled, one must still deal with the possibility that many *different* small primes have a power crossing inside the gap.

**Expected difficulty:** Very High (unconditional); Medium–High (conditional on strong gap conjectures).

**Estimated viability score:** 85/100 (as a framework that gives conditional results); 15/100 (as an unconditional plan with current technology).

**Notes on similarity to other approaches:** Distinct (this is the clean “structural reduction” approach; others focus on analytic bounds or counterexample search).


---

### **Approach 2 (Index 2): Analytic-number-theory bounds via \(\psi\) and counting prime powers in prime-free intervals (partial results / density results)**

**Name:** Control \(\psi(p_{k+1}-1)-\psi(p_k)\) using prime-power counting and short-interval estimates.

**High-level idea:**

Taking logarithms, the inequality is
\[
\psi(p_{k+1}-1) - \psi(p_k) < \log p_k,
\]
where \(\psi(x)=\sum_{p^a\le x}\log p\) is Chebyshev’s second function and satisfies \(\log L(n)=\psi(n)\). 

But between \(p_k\) and \(p_{k+1}-1\) there are no primes, so the only contributions to \(\psi\) come from prime powers \(q^a\) with \(a\ge 2\). Thus,
\[
\psi(p_{k+1}-1)-\psi(p_k)=\sum_{\substack{q^a\in(p_k,p_{k+1})\\ a\ge 2}} \log q.
\]
So we need an upper bound on this “prime-power mass” inside prime gaps.

This approach aims not necessarily at a uniform-for-all-\(k\) proof, but at:
- showing the inequality holds for “almost all” \(k\) (density \(1\)),
- or proving it holds infinitely often,
- or proving it holds under hypotheses like Cramér, Elliott–Halberstam, etc.

**Detailed plan:**

1. **Convert to \(\psi\)-difference form** using \(\log L(n)=\psi(n)\). 

2. **Rewrite the difference as sum over prime powers** in the gap (as above).

3. **Bound contributions by exponent:**
   For each \(a\ge 2\),
   \[
   \sum_{\substack{q^a\in(p_k,p_{k+1})}} \log q
   \le 
   \theta(p_{k+1}^{1/a})-\theta(p_k^{1/a}),
   \]
   where \(\theta(x)=\sum_{p\le x}\log p\) is Chebyshev’s first function.

4. **Apply upper bounds for primes in short intervals** to \(\theta\) or \(\pi\) differences (e.g. Brun–Titchmarsh type bounds, or explicit PNT error terms) to show that for “typical” gaps the total is \(<\log p_k\).

5. **Use distribution results for prime gaps** (e.g. average gap \(\sim \log p_k\)) and for prime powers to show that large accumulations are rare, giving a density-1 statement.

6. **If allowed to assume conjectures:** under Cramér-type gap bounds, immediately force the square-root interval to be so short that the \(a=2\) contribution is \(0\) for large \(k\), and the rest is even smaller; then finish as in Approach 1.

**Required tools or theorems:**

- Chebyshev functions \(\psi,\theta\) and their relation to lcm.   
- Upper bounds for primes in short intervals (Brun–Titchmarsh inequality, PNT with explicit error terms, etc.).
- Results on distribution of prime gaps “on average” (Gallagher-type heuristics, or proven mean estimates).
- Possibly RH or stronger conjectures if one wants to push from “almost all” toward “all”.

**Main obstacles:**

- A uniform bound “for every prime gap” is far beyond present analytic methods: we can bound typical behavior, but eliminating all exceptional gaps (especially those containing prime squares) is extremely hard.
- Prime squares are the dominant obstruction: bounding \(\theta(\sqrt{p_{k+1}})-\theta(\sqrt{p_k})\) by \(\log p_k\) uniformly is essentially tantamount to strong constraints on primes in *very short* intervals around \(\sqrt{p_k}\).

**Expected difficulty:** High for partial/density results; Very High for a full “all \(k\)” statement.

**Estimated viability score:** 55/100 for meaningful partial theorems (“almost all \(k\)”, conditional statements); 10/100 for a complete unconditional proof.

**Notes on similarity to other approaches:** Related to Approach 1 via the \(\psi\)-reformulation, but distinct in focusing on global analytic bounds and “most \(k\)” statements rather than a clean combinatorial product bound.


---

### **Approach 3 (Index 3): Counterexample hunting / constructive disproof via gaps containing multiple prime squares (computational + heuristic)**

**Name:** Try to falsify by locating a prime gap containing two prime squares (or enough prime-power events).

**High-level idea:**

Because the ratio
\[
\frac{L(p_{k+1}-1)}{L(p_k)}
\]
is a product of primes \(q\) corresponding to prime powers \(q^a\) in the gap, a very concrete obstruction emerges:

- If there are **two primes** \(q_1<q_2\) such that
  \[
  p_k < q_1^2,\ q_2^2 < p_{k+1},
  \]
  then the ratio includes \(q_1q_2\), and since \(q_i>\sqrt{p_k}\), one gets \(q_1q_2>p_k\), giving an immediate counterexample.

This matches the Erdős–Graham remark that ruling out “many primes \(q\) with \(p_k<q^2<p_{k+1}\)” is a key difficulty. 

So a viable “attack” is to search computationally for such a configuration (or more generally check whether the product condition fails) among known large prime gaps.

**Detailed plan:**

1. **Implement the exact ratio test efficiently:**
   For each \(k\), compute the set
   \[
   S_k=\{q:\exists a\ge 2,\ p_k<q^a<p_{k+1}\},
   \]
   then check whether \(\prod_{q\in S_k}q < p_k\).

2. **Prioritize large prime gaps:**
   The inequality is easiest to violate when \(p_{k+1}-p_k\) is unusually large, because larger gaps are more likely to contain prime squares/cubes/etc.

3. **Fast detection of prime squares in a gap:**
   - Compute \(A=\lceil \sqrt{p_k+1}\rceil\), \(B=\lfloor\sqrt{p_{k+1}-1}\rfloor\).
   - Enumerate primes in \([A,B]\); if there are \(\ge 2\), you have a counterexample immediately.

4. **If no counterexamples via squares, extend to other powers:**
   check for primes \(q\) with \(q^3\) in the gap, etc. (Though squares are likely the main driver.)

5. **Heuristic guidance:**
   Use probabilistic models (Cramér model) to estimate how often a prime gap of size \(\gg \sqrt{x}\) occurs and how often it would contain \(\ge 2\) prime squares, guiding where to look.

6. **(Conditional constructive disproof idea):**
   Try to engineer long intervals of consecutive composites that contain two specific prime squares using CRT-type congruences, then invoke a prime \(k\)-tuple conjecture to argue existence of primes at endpoints. This would be conditional but could suggest whether counterexamples are expected.

**Required tools or theorems:**

- Computational prime generation / prime gap tables.
- Efficient primality testing and prime enumeration in intervals.
- Number-theoretic optimization for checking prime powers.

**Main obstacles:**

- If the statement is true (as Erdős–Graham suspect), no finite search will find a counterexample.
- Even if false, the first counterexample might occur at an astronomically large prime, well beyond practical computation.
- Constructively forcing both endpoints to be consecutive primes is hard; CRT constructions create composite runs but don’t directly yield the primes at the ends.

**Expected difficulty:** Medium (computational exploration); Very High (rigorous constructive disproof).

**Estimated viability score:** 45/100 (good for falsification attempts / evidence gathering; not guaranteed to resolve).

**Notes on similarity to other approaches:** Distinct (this is a falsification/computation-oriented strategy rather than a proof strategy).


## Overall recommendation

**Recommended approach indices:** \([1, 2]\)

**Rationale:**
Approach 1 is the clean structural reduction that clarifies *exactly* what must be controlled (prime powers inside prime gaps) and is the natural starting point for both conditional proofs and for identifying the true obstruction (multiple prime squares). Approach 2 complements it by suggesting how one might get partial progress (“almost all \(k\)” statements) using existing analytic tools around \(\psi\) and short-interval prime estimates. Approach 3 is valuable for gathering numerical evidence or attempting disproof, but it is less likely to produce a definitive theoretical resolution.

## Internet search results

A directly matching reference was found: the question appears as **Erdős Problem #458**, listed as *open* (as of last edit 07 October 2025), and Erdős–Graham remark that it is “almost certainly” true but difficult, especially because one must rule out many primes \(q\) with \(p_k<q^2<p_{k+1}\).

# Expert evaluator's assessment and feedback on the proposed approaches

## 2. Global assessment

The proposed approaches collectively show a good grasp of the structural identity behind \(\mathrm{lcm}(1,\dots,n)\) and correctly identify that the “action” between \(p_k\) and \(p_{k+1}-1\) comes only from prime-power thresholds. Approach 1, in particular, contains the key reduction that turns the original inequality into a concrete multiplicative condition on primes whose powers land in a prime gap, and it correctly flags prime squares as the main obstruction. Approach 2 is essentially the logarithmic/analytic restatement of the same mechanism and is realistic for partial results (density/conditional), but not for a uniform “all \(k\)” theorem with current techniques. Approach 3 is a sensible falsification/evidence-gathering plan, especially because the reduction gives an efficient exact test, though it is unlikely to settle the problem either way unless a relatively small counterexample exists. Overall, the approaches are conceptually aligned with what one would expect for this kind of problem, but none bridges the core gap: obtaining a uniform, all-\(k\) control on prime powers inside prime gaps is (as the solver also notes) at the edge of or beyond current technology.

Overall viability score (0–100): **28**

Key global concerns:
- The hard core is effectively a **prime-gaps / primes-near-squares** obstruction; none of the approaches provides an unconditional route around it.
- The “small primes / many different prime powers in one gap” scenario is acknowledged but not yet reduced to a tractable lemma.
- Several subclaims are stated in heuristic terms (“dangerous case”, “eventually none”) without a clear plan for rigorous quantification under explicit hypotheses.

## 3. Addressing assumptions or clarifications

No assumptions or clarifications were provided.

## 4. Per-approach feedback

### Approach 1: Prime-power “jump factor” reformulation + prime-gap control (conditional route)

Viability score (0–100): **40** (high as a *framework* and for conditional results; low for an unconditional resolution)

**Strengths**
- The core reduction is correct and extremely valuable: between \(p_k\) and \(p_{k+1}-1\) there are no primes, so changes in \(L(n)\) come only from prime powers \(q^a\) with \(a\ge 2\).
- Using \(p_{k+1}<2p_k\) (Bertrand) to argue that each prime \(q\) can contribute at most one “jump” (hence a squarefree factor) is a sound and clean structural simplification.
- Reformulating the inequality as \(\prod_{q\in S_k} q < p_k\) is the right “combinatorial skeleton” of the problem; it isolates exactly what must be ruled out.
- The identification of “two prime squares in the gap \(\Rightarrow\) immediate violation” is correct and pinpoints why this brushes up against Legendre-type difficulties.

**Weaknesses**
- The proposed sufficient condition \(\sqrt{p_{k+1}}-\sqrt{p_k}<1\) is *far stronger* than what is known unconditionally, and it effectively imports a very hard prime-gap regime. As written, the unconditional plan stalls exactly where current prime-gap technology is weakest.
- Step 8 (“handle small primes trouble”) is presently a placeholder: for a full proof one needs a concrete, rigorous bound showing that **many distinct small primes** cannot simultaneously have a power in the same prime gap in a way that makes \(\prod q \ge p_k\). This is nontrivial and is not automatically implied by controlling squares.
- Even conditionally, one must be careful about what hypothesis is actually needed: Cramér-type bounds make the root intervals tiny, but you still need to formalize “eventually empty” versus “at most one prime” in each root interval and check the finite exceptional range.

Severity flags: **missing critical subproblem**, **likely intractable** (unconditionally).

**Suggested refinements**
- Write and prove explicitly the key lemma: for consecutive primes \(p<p'\) with \(p'\le 2p\),
  \[
  \frac{L(p'-1)}{L(p)}=\prod_{\substack{q\ \text{prime}\\ \exists a\ge 2:\ p<q^a<p'}} q,
  \]
  and justify carefully why each \(q\) appears with exponent \(0\) or \(1\) (using \(p'/p<2\)).
- Separate the obstruction into clear minimal “failure patterns”, e.g.
  - (i) at least two squares \(q_1^2,q_2^2\) in the gap;
  - (ii) one square plus enough higher-power events to push the product \(\ge p_k\);
  - (iii) no squares but enough higher-power events (cubes, fourth powers, …) to push the product \(\ge p_k\).
  This forces you to quantify what “small primes trouble” actually means.
- If you pursue conditional results, state the *exact* prime-gap hypothesis you need (e.g. \(p_{k+1}-p_k \ll (\log p_k)^2\)) and derive explicitly the consequent bounds on \(\sqrt{p_{k+1}}-\sqrt{p_k}\) and on \(p_{k+1}^{1/a}-p_k^{1/a}\) for each \(a\ge 2\).
- Don’t rely on the “interval length \(<1\)” trick as the only way to ensure \(\le 1\) prime; if you stay conditional anyway, you may be able to use explicit upper bounds on \(\pi(x+y)-\pi(x)\) in short intervals under RH/other hypotheses (even if still too weak unconditionally).

---

### Approach 2: Analytic-number-theory bounds via \(\psi\) and counting prime powers in prime-free intervals (partial results / density results)

Viability score (0–100): **30** (good for “almost all \(k\)”/conditional statements; poor for “all \(k\)”)

**Strengths**
- The logarithmic restatement
  \[
  \log L(n)=\psi(n),\qquad \psi(x)=\sum_{p^a\le x}\log p
  \]
  and the gap identity
  \[
  \psi(p_{k+1}-1)-\psi(p_k)=\sum_{\substack{q^a\in(p_k,p_{k+1})\\ a\ge 2}}\log q
  \]
  correctly captures the problem and aligns with standard analytic number theory machinery.
- Splitting by exponent \(a\) and comparing to \(\theta(p_{k+1}^{1/a})-\theta(p_k^{1/a})\) is a reasonable way to connect the problem to prime-counting in short intervals.
- The approach is realistically positioned to deliver partial results (e.g., bounds for “most \(k\)” or under RH/Cramér-type hypotheses).

**Weaknesses**
- As with Approach 1, the real obstruction is *uniform control* of prime powers in prime gaps, and analytic tools are typically strongest “on average”; converting average bounds into a uniform-for-every-gap statement is the missing leap.
- The plan as written leans heavily on “typical gap size” heuristics, but note that **a small gap can still contain a prime square** if \(p_k\) happens to lie just below \(q^2\). So it’s not only about large gaps; it’s about arithmetic alignment with prime powers.
- Using \(\theta\)-differences alone may be too coarse, because the inequality is essentially a multiplicative threshold (\(\prod q < p_k\)), and bounding sums of \(\log q\) requires capturing rare “cluster” events, not just expected counts.

Severity flags: **missing critical subproblem**, **likely intractable** (for the full “all \(k\)” goal).

**Suggested refinements**
- Make explicit which target you are aiming for:  
  - (A) “for all sufficiently large \(k\) under hypothesis \(H\)”,  
  - (B) “for density \(1\) of \(k\)”, or  
  - (C) “infinitely many \(k\)”.  
  Each requires different tools and different notions of “exceptional set”.
- Translate the multiplicative condition into a sharp logarithmic threshold: you need
  \[
  \sum_{q\in S_k}\log q < \log p_k,
  \]
  and then treat separately the square contribution (terms \(\approx \tfrac12\log p_k\)) versus higher powers.
- If pursuing density results, consider a double-counting setup (still within your framework): count how often a given prime power \(q^a\) can fall into a prime gap \((p_k,p_{k+1})\), and sum over prime powers \(\le x\). This is the kind of step that can turn “rare events” into quantitative bounds on the exceptional set.
- Under explicit hypotheses (RH, Cramér-type), state clearly which short-interval bounds for \(\theta\) or \(\pi\) you would invoke, and verify they are strong enough to force \(\theta\)-increments \(<\log p_k\) in the relevant root intervals.

---

### Approach 3: Counterexample hunting / constructive disproof via gaps containing multiple prime squares (computational + heuristic)

Viability score (0–100): **22** (useful for evidence/falsification; unlikely to settle definitively)

**Strengths**
- This approach correctly exploits the sharp structural reduction: you do **not** need to compute huge \(\mathrm{lcm}\) values; you only need to detect which primes \(q\) have a power crossing inside \((p_k,p_{k+1})\).
- The “two prime squares in one prime gap \(\Rightarrow\) immediate counterexample” criterion is a very clean sufficient condition for falsity, and it is computationally checkable.
- Computational exploration can meaningfully inform the theoretical side: it can reveal what “typical” sets \(S_k\) look like, how often squares occur, and whether failures might instead come from many small primes.

**Weaknesses**
- A search biased toward large prime gaps may not be optimally targeted: failure can come from **arithmetic coincidence** (prime near many prime powers), not necessarily from record-sized gaps.
- The “two prime squares” disproof route likely requires an *enormous* gap length to fit two distinct prime squares near the same scale; if the inequality is false but only at astronomically large \(k\), computation will not reach it.
- The “CRT to engineer composite blocks” idea does not directly produce *consecutive primes* at the endpoints, so it is hard to turn into a rigorous counterexample construction even conditionally.

Severity flags: **missing critical subproblem** (turning heuristics/computation into a proof or disproof).

**Suggested refinements**
- Implement the exact ratio test via “next power crossing” per prime \(q\): for each prime \(q\le \sqrt{p_{k+1}-1}\), compute \(e=\lfloor \log_q(p_k)\rfloor\) and check whether \(q^{e+1}\le p_{k+1}-1\); if yes, multiply the running product by \(q\) (stop early if the product \(\ge p_k\)).
- Don’t restrict to squares-only filters: also log which exponents \(a\ge 3\) occur, because a plausible first failure (if any) could be “one square + several small primes”, not necessarily “two squares”.
- When prioritizing \(k\) to test, consider not only large gaps, but also primes \(p_k\) lying within a very small distance below a prime square or other prime power (this is still within your stated “prime-power events” framework).
- If you use external prime-gap tables, ensure the boundary conditions match the statement exactly: the interval is \((p_k,\,p_{k+1}-1]\), equivalently \(p_k < q^a < p_{k+1}\).

## 5. Recommended approaches

Recommended approach indices: **1, 3, 2**

Recommendation rationale:  
Start with Approach 1 because it gives the clean, correct structural reduction to a squarefree product over primes whose powers fall in the prime gap; without that reduction it is hard to even state the right intermediate lemmas. Run Approach 3 in parallel, because once you have the product formulation, computational checks become straightforward and can quickly rule out small counterexamples, test “minimal failure patterns”, and guide which configurations (squares vs many small primes) are actually relevant in practice. Keep Approach 2 as a secondary theoretical track if the goal shifts to partial results (“almost all \(k\)”) or conditional results (RH/Cramér-type), since it packages the same phenomenon in an analytic language where average bounds and short-interval estimates are applicable. In other words: use Approach 1 to define the exact combinatorial target; use Approach 3 to explore that target empirically and stress-test conjectured obstructions; and use Approach 2 if you want a route to provable asymptotic/density statements even when the full uniform inequality remains out of reach.
