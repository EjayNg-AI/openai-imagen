Define \\(F_k := f^{2^k}\\) (the \\(2^k\\)-fold iterate). Then:\n   \\[\n   x_{2^k}=F_k(0),\\qquad x_{2^{k+1}}=F_k(x_{2^k})=F_k(F_k(0)).\n   \\]\n3. **Prove a valuation lemma for the “constant term”:**\n   \\[\n   v_2(x_{2^k}) = k+2.\n   \\]\n   This can be shown by modular-period arguments (orbit length doubling mod \\(2^m\\)) or by a dedicated induction using congruences of \\(f^{2^k}(0)\\) mod \\(2^{k+3}\\).\n4. **Compute/estimate the “multiplier”:**\n   \\[\n   D_k := F_k'(0).\n   \\]\n   Use the chain rule for iterates:\n   \\[\n   F_k'(0)=\\prod_{i=0}^{2^k-1} f'(x_i),\\quad f'(x)=2x+1.\n   \\]\n   Since each \\(x_i\\) is even, each factor is \\(1 \\bmod 4\\), and one aims to prove the sharper statement\n   \\[\n   v_2(D_k-1)=k+1.\n   \\]\n   A plausible route is to use the \\(2\\)-adic logarithm:\n   \\[\n   \\log(D_k)=\\sum_{i=0}^{2^k-1}\\log(1+2x_i),\n   \\]\n   and show the leading valuation of the RHS is \\(k+1\\). One needs to control cross-terms to ensure no extra cancellation.\n5. **Do the Taylor expansion of \\(F_k\\) around \\(0\\):**\n   \\[\n   F_k(x) = F_k(0) + D_k x + x^2\\cdot(\\text{integer polynomial }H_k(x)).\n   \\]\n6. Plug \\(x=x_{2^k}=F_k(0)\\). Then\n   \\[\n   x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k}\n   = \\bigl(D_k-1\\bigr)x_{2^k} + x_{2^k}^2 H_k(x_{2^k}).\n   \\]\n7. **Valuation comparison:** show\n   \\[\n   v_2\\!\\left( (D_k-1)x_{2^k}\\right) = (k+1)+(k+2)=2k+3\n   \\]\n   while\n   \\[\n   v_2\\!\\left(x_{2^k}^2 H_k(x_{2^k})\\right) \\ge 2(k+2) = 2k+4,\n   \\]\n   so the quadratic term is strictly more divisible by 2 and cannot affect the exact valuation.\n8. Conclude \\(v_2(x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k})=2k+3\\), hence \\(v_2(b_{2^{k+1}}-2b_{2^k})=2k+2\\).\n\n#### Required tools or theorems\n- Chain rule for derivatives of iterated polynomials.\n- Basic \\(2\\)-adic valuation estimates.\n- \\(2\\)-adic logarithm properties for numbers \\(\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\) (optional but helpful).\n- Modular arithmetic / orbit-period doubling ideas to establish \\(v_2(x_{2^k})\\).\n\n#### Main obstacles\n- Proving the sharp multiplier valuation \\(v_2(D_k-1)=k+1\\) without invoking heavy \\(p\\)-adic dynamics machinery.\n- Ensuring that in the product \\(\\prod (1+2x_i)\\), cross-terms do not introduce unexpected extra powers of 2 (or cancellation).\n- Establishing a clean and elementary proof of \\(v_2(x_{2^k})=k+2\\).\n\n#### Expected difficulty\nHigh (but very structured; feels like the “right” framework).\n\n#### Estimated viability score\n85/100.\n\n#### Notes on similarity to other approaches\nSimilar in spirit to Approach 2 (both are \\(2\\)-adic-dynamical), but this one is more “hands-on Taylor/derivative” and less theorem-driven.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 2 (Index 2): 2-adic dynamical systems—cycle lifting and multipliers**\n**Name:** Period doubling mod \\(2^m\\) and lifting cycles\n\n#### High-level idea\nView \\(x_{n+1}=f(x_n)\\) with \\(f(x)=x^2+x+2\\) as a dynamical system on \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2^m\\mathbb{Z}\\). Empirically, the orbit of \\(0\\) has period \\(2^{m-2}\\) modulo \\(2^m\\) (e.g., period \\(2\\) mod \\(8\\), period \\(4\\) mod \\(16\\), etc.). This “period doubling” phenomenon is a standard hallmark of cycle lifting in \\(2\\)-adic dynamics.\n\nOnce you know that the orbit length doubles at each lift, you typically also get:\n- the exact valuation of \\(x_{2^k}=f^{2^k}(0)\\) (it is the first return to \\(0\\) mod \\(2^{k+2}\\)), and\n- information about the *multiplier* \\(F_k'(0)\\) of the lifted cycle.\n\nThen translate those dynamical facts into the desired exact valuation for \\(x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k}\\) (and hence for \\(b\\)).\n\n#### Detailed plan\n1. Again set \\(x_n=2b_n\\) so \\(x_{n+1}=f(x_n)=x_n^2+x_n+2\\).\n2. Work modulo \\(2^m\\). Prove by induction on \\(m\\) that:\n   - The orbit of \\(0\\) under \\(f\\) has **exact** period \\(2^{m-2}\\) modulo \\(2^m\\).\n   - Equivalently, \\(x_{2^{m-2}}\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2^m}\\) but \\(x_{2^{m-3}}\\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2^m}\\).\n3. Translate this into the valuation statement:\n   \\[\n   v_2(x_{2^k})=k+2.\n   \\]\n4. Use the standard cycle-lifting criterion involving the multiplier:\n   - Let \\(F_k=f^{2^k}\\).\n   - A “growing cycle” often satisfies \\(F_k(0)\\equiv 0\\pmod{2^{k+2}}\\) and\n     \\[\n     F_k'(0)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{k+1}},\\quad F_k'(0)\\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{k+2}}.\n     \\]\n5. With these in hand, use a (possibly theorem-backed) \\(2\\)-adic linearization argument:\n   \\[\n   x_{2^{k+1}}=F_k(x_{2^k}) \\approx F_k(0)+F_k'(0)\\,x_{2^k}.\n   \\]\n   The deviation from exact linearity is quadratic and thus has higher \\(2\\)-adic valuation once \\(x_{2^k}\\) is highly divisible by \\(2\\).\n6. Deduce \\(v_2(x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k})=2k+3\\) and convert back to \\(b\\).\n\n#### Required tools or theorems\n- Structure of polynomial dynamics mod \\(2^m\\).\n- Cycle lifting theorems / “multiplier” criteria (even if re-proved ad hoc in this special case).\n- Basic properties of derivatives modulo powers of 2.\n\n#### Main obstacles\n- If one wants to stay fully elementary, one must essentially *re-prove* the needed cycle-lifting facts for this specific \\(f\\); otherwise one risks citing heavy \\(p\\)-adic dynamics results.\n- Converting the abstract “multiplier” facts into the exact valuation statement requires careful bookkeeping of error terms.\n\n#### Expected difficulty\nVery High if kept elementary; Medium–High if allowed to use known \\(2\\)-adic dynamics results.\n\n#### Estimated viability score\n70/100 (higher if the problem context allows \\(p\\)-adic dynamics theorems).\n\n#### Notes on similarity to other approaches\nRelated to Approach 1, but more global/dynamical rather than explicit Taylor expansion with computed valuations.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 3 (Index 3): Explicit congruence recursion for iterates \\(f^{2^k}\\) modulo \\(2^{2k+4}\\)**\n**Name:** Constructive modular computation of \\(f^{2^k}(x)\\) to first nontrivial order\n\n#### High-level idea\nInstead of focusing on derivatives abstractly, directly compute congruence formulas for the iterated polynomial\n\\[\nF_k(x)=f^{2^k}(x)\n\\]\nmodulo a carefully chosen power of 2, keeping only the terms that can influence divisibility up to \\(2^{2k+4}\\).\n\nThe goal is to prove an explicit congruence of the shape\n\\[\nF_k(x)\\equiv A_k + B_k x \\pmod{2^{2k+4}}\n\\]\nfor inputs \\(x\\) that are themselves divisible by \\(2^{k+2}\\) (which is exactly the situation when plugging in \\(x=x_{2^k}\\)). The quadratic (and higher) contributions should vanish modulo \\(2^{2k+4}\\) because \\(x^2\\) is then divisible by \\(2^{2k+4}\\).\n\nOnce such an affine approximation is established:\n- plugging \\(x=0\\) gives \\(x_{2^k}=A_k\\),\n- plugging \\(x=x_{2^k}\\) gives \\(x_{2^{k+1}} \\equiv A_k + B_k A_k\\),\nand the desired difference reduces to an explicit valuation computation with \\(A_k\\) and \\(B_k-1\\).\n\n#### Detailed plan\n1. Work with \\(x_n=2b_n\\) and \\(f(x)=x^2+x+2\\).\n2. Define \\(F_k=f^{2^k}\\). Observe the composition identity:\n   \\[\n   F_{k+1} = F_k\\circ F_k.\n   \\]\n3. Prove an inductive statement like:\n\n   > (**Affine approximation lemma**) For each \\(k\\ge 1\\), there exist integers \\(A_k,B_k\\) such that for all \\(x\\) divisible by \\(2^{k+2}\\),\n   > \\[\n   > F_k(x)\\equiv A_k + B_k x \\pmod{2^{2k+4}},\n   > \\]\n   > and moreover \\(v_2(A_k)=k+2\\), \\(v_2(B_k-1)=k+1\\).\n\n4. The induction step uses:\n   - If \\(x\\equiv 0\\pmod{2^{k+2}}\\), then \\(x^2\\equiv 0\\pmod{2^{2k+4}}\\), so quadratic terms die at the needed modulus.\n   - Composition:\n     \\[\n     F_{k+1}(x)=F_k(F_k(x))\\equiv A_k + B_k(A_k + B_k x)= (A_k+B_kA_k) + B_k^2 x\n     \\]\n     modulo \\(2^{2k+6}\\), provided the “quadratic errors” are controlled.\n5. Extract recurrences:\n   \\[\n   A_{k+1}\\equiv A_k(1+B_k),\\qquad B_{k+1}\\equiv B_k^2\n   \\]\n   modulo suitable powers of 2.\n6. Use these to show:\n   - \\(v_2(A_k)=k+2\\) sharply,\n   - \\(v_2(B_k-1)=k+1\\) sharply,\n   and finally\n   \\[\n   x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k} = F_k(A_k)-2A_k \\equiv (B_k-1)A_k \\pmod{2^{2k+4}},\n   \\]\n   giving exact valuation \\(2k+3\\).\n7. Convert back to \\(b\\).\n\n#### Required tools or theorems\n- Modular arithmetic with polynomial compositions.\n- Careful control of when quadratic terms vanish modulo \\(2^N\\).\n- Induction on \\(k\\) using composition \\(F_{k+1}=F_k\\circ F_k\\).\n\n#### Main obstacles\n- One must choose moduli carefully: proving that the quadratic remainder in \\(F_k\\) truly becomes irrelevant modulo \\(2^{2k+4}\\) when evaluated at multiples of \\(2^{k+2}\\).\n- Establishing the sharp “not divisible by the next power” requires tracking one more bit than the “divisible by” part.\n\n#### Expected difficulty\nMedium–High (technical but elementary).\n\n#### Estimated viability score\n80/100.\n\n#### Notes on similarity to other approaches\nDistinct from Approach 2; partially overlaps with Approach 1 in that it effectively computes the same linear coefficient \\(B_k=F_k'(0)\\) but does so via explicit modular composition rather than derivative products/logarithms.\n\n---\n\n## Overall recommendation\n\n### Recommended approach indices\n**[1, 3]**\n\n### Rationale\nApproach 1 gives a very clean conceptual reduction: the target valuation is essentially the sum of two valuations, \\(v_2(x_{2^k})\\) and \\(v_2(F_k'(0)-1)\\), provided higher-order terms are controlled. Approach 3 is the most promising way to keep everything elementary while still being systematic: it replaces “compute a scary derivative product” with explicit modular composition and a controlled affine approximation on a shrinking \\(2\\)-adic neighborhood. Approach 2 is elegant but risks requiring external \\(2\\)-adic dynamics theorems unless one rebuilds them from scratch.\n\n---\n\n## Internet search results\n\nA web search was performed for the exact recurrence and divisibility statement; no direct match (same problem) and no posted solution (partial or full) was found. The results returned were unrelated pages (e.g. generic recurrence/divisibility or unrelated AoPS/wiki pages) rather than this specific problem.

      "text": "# APPROACH_EVALUATOR's assessment and feedback on the proposed approaches\n\n## 2. Global assessment\n\nThe proposed approaches are overall strong and well-targeted: all three correctly identify that the statement is about *exact* \\(2\\)-adic valuation along iterates of a polynomial map, and they sensibly normalize via \\(x_n=2b_n\\) to work with \\(f(x)=x^2+x+2\\). Approaches 1 and 3, in particular, reduce the target valuation to a “linear term dominates” phenomenon, which is the right conceptual spine for this kind of problem. The main recurring difficulty is that the claim is *sharp* (“divisible by \\(2^{2k+2}\\) but not \\(2^{2k+3}\\)”), so any approach must control congruences one power of \\(2\\) beyond the easy divisibility bound and must rule out accidental cancellation. Approach 1 is conceptually elegant but risks getting bogged down in proving sharp statements about the multiplier \\((f^{2^k})'(0)\\) without importing heavy \\(2\\)-adic dynamics machinery. Approach 2 is natural from \\(2\\)-adic dynamics but is the most vulnerable to “black-box theorem dependence” unless the proposer is willing to reprove cycle-lifting results in this special case. Approach 3 looks the most elementary and realistically executable in an olympiad/contest setting, but it requires very careful bookkeeping of moduli and remainder terms in compositions.\n\n**Overall viability score (0–100): 82**\n\n**Key global concerns:**\n- The sharp “not divisible by the next power of 2” part forces one to control congruences/moduli extremely carefully; many arguments that show “\\(\\ge\\)” valuations will not automatically give “\\(=\\)”.\n- In Approaches 1 and 2, the critical subproblem is computing \\(v_2\\bigl((f^{2^k})'(0)-1\\bigr)\\) sharply; without a clean lemma here, the rest of the framework stalls.\n- In Approach 3, the critical subproblem is a rigorous “affine approximation under composition” statement with explicit modulus bounds; if the modulus is off by even one power of \\(2\\), the sharp valuation can be lost.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Addressing assumptions or clarifications\n\nNo assumptions or clarifications were provided.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Per-approach feedback\n\n### Approach 1: Linearization of the \\(2^k\\)-th iterate and valuation extraction\n\n**Viability score (0–100): 78**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Correctly isolates the structurally relevant quantity: with \\(x_n=2b_n\\) and \\(f(x)=x^2+x+2\\), the target reduces to showing\n  \\[\n  v_2\\bigl(x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k}\\bigr)=2k+3,\n  \\]\n  and the “Taylor expansion around 0 for \\(F_k=f^{2^k}\\)” is a very natural way to make the linear term \\((F_k'(0)-1)x_{2^k}\\) appear.\n- The decomposition\n  \\[\n  F_k(x)=F_k(0)+F_k'(0)x + x^2(\\cdots)\n  \\]\n  is robust and, if justified carefully, automatically gives the desired “linear term dominates quadratic error” valuation comparison.\n- The chain rule/product formula for \\(F_k'(0)\\) is standard and relevant:\n  \\[\n  F_k'(0)=\\prod_{i=0}^{2^k-1} (2x_i+1).\n  \\]\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Missing critical subproblem:** proving the *sharp* multiplier valuation\n  \\[\n  v_2\\bigl(F_k'(0)-1\\bigr)=k+1\n  \\]\n  in a clean, elementary way. The proposed \\(2\\)-adic logarithm route is plausible but nontrivial: you must justify that the leading term in \\(\\sum \\log(1+2x_i)\\) has valuation exactly \\(k+1\\) and that there is no unexpected cancellation.\n- The plan also relies on a sharp statement \\(v_2(x_{2^k})=k+2\\). This is believable (and empirically true for small \\(k\\)), but it is not “free”: one needs a proof that avoids circular dependence on the same kind of multiplier computation.\n- The “higher-order terms have larger valuation” claim needs a **precise integrality statement**: you want to know that the remainder is divisible by \\(x^2\\) with an *integer* coefficient polynomial, uniformly in \\(k\\). It is true for polynomials over \\(\\mathbb Z\\), but you still must show that when evaluated at \\(x=x_{2^k}\\) the remainder is \\(\\ge 2k+4\\) in valuation, and this requires knowing \\(v_2(x_{2^k})\\) sharply.\n\n**Severity flags:** missing critical subproblem.\n\n**Suggested refinements:**\n- Replace the \\(2\\)-adic logarithm step with a more elementary congruence lemma for products of the form \\(\\prod (1+2x_i)\\) where the \\(x_i\\) satisfy a recurrence and have known valuations. A typical needed lemma is: if \\(u_i\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}\\), then\n  \\[\n  \\prod_{i=1}^N u_i \\equiv 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^N (u_i-1) \\pmod{8}\n  \\]\n  and higher-modulus analogues with explicit error bounds; you would need a version tuned to modulus \\(2^{k+2}\\).\n- Formulate an explicit inductive claim for \\(x_{2^k}\\) modulo \\(2^{k+3}\\) (not just its valuation). Often one proves something like\n  \\[\n  x_{2^k}\\equiv 2^{k+2}\\pmod{2^{k+3}}\n  \\]\n  (or an odd multiple thereof). This simultaneously gives \\(v_2(x_{2^k})=k+2\\) and provides “oddness data” needed later to prevent cancellation.\n- Be explicit about the remainder control: prove a lemma of the form  \n  **Lemma:** If \\(P\\in\\mathbb Z[x]\\) and \\(P(0)=0=P'(0)\\), then \\(P(x)=x^2Q(x)\\) with \\(Q\\in\\mathbb Z[x]\\), hence \\(v_2(P(x))\\ge 2v_2(x)\\).  \n  This is simple but should be stated clearly because it is the key justification for dropping quadratic terms.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 2: Period doubling mod \\(2^m\\) and lifting cycles\n\n**Viability score (0–100): 62**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The “period doubling modulo \\(2^m\\)” heuristic is very aligned with how these iterates often behave in \\(\\mathbb Z_2\\), and it naturally explains why \\(x_{2^k}\\) should gain exactly one extra factor of \\(2\\) as \\(k\\) increases.\n- If one is allowed to use established results from \\(2\\)-adic dynamics/cycle lifting (multiplier criteria, growing cycles, etc.), then the approach can be quite short and conceptually clean.\n- It packages both key needed facts—\\(v_2(x_{2^k})\\) and the multiplier congruence \\(F_k'(0)\\equiv 1\\pmod{2^{k+1}}\\) but not \\(\\pmod{2^{k+2}}\\)—under one unifying framework.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Conceptual mismatch risk (for contest settings):** unless the problem explicitly expects \\(2\\)-adic dynamics machinery, this approach can become “citation-heavy” and may not be acceptable without re-deriving the needed lifting theorems from scratch.\n- Even if period-doubling is established, translating it into the *exact* valuation of \\(x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k}\\) still essentially requires the same kind of linearization/error-term argument as Approach 1 or 3; so one doesn’t fully escape the technical core.\n- The approach outline glosses over the hardest step: proving the orbit of \\(0\\) has exact period \\(2^{m-2}\\) mod \\(2^m\\) for all \\(m\\). That statement is itself nontrivial and is basically another incarnation of the valuation claims you need.\n\n**Severity flags:** missing critical subproblem.\n\n**Suggested refinements:**\n- If you want to keep it elementary, narrow the scope: instead of proving “exact period \\(2^{m-2}\\) mod \\(2^m\\)” in full generality, prove only what you need: a sharp congruence for \\(x_{2^k}\\) mod \\(2^{k+3}\\) and a sharp congruence for \\(F_k'(0)\\) mod \\(2^{k+2}\\).\n- Explicitly identify the cycle-lifting lemma you intend to use (e.g., a version of Hensel lifting for cycles) and state it with hypotheses checked for \\(f(x)=x^2+x+2\\). The single most likely blocking lemma is precisely the multiplier condition “\\(F_k'(0)\\equiv 1\\pmod{2^{k+1}}\\) but not \\(\\pmod{2^{k+2}}\\)”.\n- Combine with Approach 3’s affine-approximation under composition: use “dynamics” mainly to guess the right congruences, then prove them by explicit modular induction rather than abstract cycle-lifting.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 3: Constructive modular computation of \\(f^{2^k}(x)\\) to first nontrivial order\n\n**Viability score (0–100): 88**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- This is the most *elementary-leaning* and operational plan: it aims to prove explicit congruences for \\(F_k=f^{2^k}\\) under composition, which is exactly the structure available since \\(F_{k+1}=F_k\\circ F_k\\).\n- The key idea—working on inputs \\(x\\) divisible by \\(2^{k+2}\\) so that \\(x^2\\) vanishes modulo \\(2^{2k+4}\\)—is very well-matched to the target valuation scale \\(2k+3\\) (for \\(x\\)-version) / \\(2k+2\\) (for \\(b\\)-version).\n- The recurrences \\(B_{k+1}\\equiv B_k^2\\) and \\(A_{k+1}\\equiv A_k(1+B_k)\\) are plausible and powerful: once you show \\(B_k=1+2^{k+1}(\\text{odd})\\) and \\(A_k=2^{k+2}(\\text{odd})\\), the valuation growth becomes almost automatic and the “not divisible by the next power” becomes a parity check.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Missing critical subproblem:** making the “affine approximation lemma” fully rigorous with the *correct modulus* at each step. Composition can amplify errors: if\n  \\[\n  F_k(x)=A_k+B_kx + E_k(x),\n  \\]\n  you need a quantitative bound like \\(v_2(E_k(x))\\ge 2k+4\\) for \\(x\\equiv 0\\pmod{2^{k+2}}\\), and then you must show that when you plug \\(F_k(x)\\) back into \\(F_k\\), the new error remains negligible modulo \\(2^{2(k+1)+4}\\). This is not automatic unless you control how large \\(F_k(x)\\) remains \\(2\\)-adically on that domain.\n- The approach as written asserts that “quadratic errors are controlled” but doesn’t specify the inductive invariant that ensures this under repeated squaring/composition. Without a clean invariant, the induction may break at exactly the sharp modulus needed.\n- Tracking the “not divisible by \\(2^{2k+5}\\)” (for the \\(x\\)-difference) requires you to carry congruences one step further than the annihilation of \\(x^2\\), i.e., you’ll likely need explicit information modulo \\(2^{2k+5}\\) at some point (or an “oddness” statement that survives).\n\n**Severity flags:** missing critical subproblem.\n\n**Suggested refinements:**\n- State and prove a *two-part inductive invariant* for \\(F_k\\):\n  1. **Domain preservation:** If \\(x\\equiv 0\\pmod{2^{k+2}}\\), then \\(F_k(x)\\equiv 0\\pmod{2^{k+2}}\\) (or even \\(\\equiv A_k\\pmod{2^{k+2}}\\) with \\(A_k\\) itself divisible by \\(2^{k+2}\\)). This ensures you can reapply the affine approximation at the next composition.\n  2. **Error divisibility:** For \\(x\\equiv 0\\pmod{2^{k+2}}\\), the remainder satisfies \\(E_k(x)\\equiv 0\\pmod{2^{2k+4}}\\) (or a slightly stronger bound if needed).\n- When deriving \\(B_{k+1}\\equiv B_k^2\\), be explicit about what modulus this congruence holds in (likely \\(2^{k+2}\\) or \\(2^{k+3}\\)), and ensure it is strong enough to inductively get \\(v_2(B_k-1)=k+1\\) *sharply* (i.e., to keep the coefficient odd).\n- Build in an “oddness certificate”: for example, try to prove inductively that\n  \\[\n  \\frac{A_k}{2^{k+2}} \\text{ is odd},\\qquad \\frac{B_k-1}{2^{k+1}} \\text{ is odd}.\n  \\]\n  These parity statements are exactly what prevents the valuation from jumping by an extra 1 due to cancellation.\n- Consider proving a slightly more informative congruence than purely affine, e.g.\n  \\[\n  F_k(x)\\equiv A_k + B_k x \\pmod{2^{2k+5}}\n  \\]\n  on the restricted domain, or include the first nontrivial quadratic correction with a known factor of \\(2\\). Sometimes adding one controlled quadratic term makes the induction cleaner than trying to kill all quadratic contributions at once.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Recommended approaches\n\n**Recommended approach indices:** 3 (primary), then 1 (secondary support)\n\n**Recommendation rationale:**  \nApproach 3 is the best starting point because it is the most likely to yield a fully self-contained, elementary proof with explicit congruence control—exactly what the “divisible by \\(2^{2k+2}\\) but not \\(2^{2k+3}\\)” phrasing suggests. Its use of the composition identity \\(F_{k+1}=F_k\\circ F_k\\) is directly adapted to the \\(2^k\\) indices in the statement, and it naturally produces the needed “oddness” witnesses to rule out the next power of 2. Approach 1 is an excellent conceptual backup: if Approach 3 stalls in formalizing error terms under composition, Approach 1’s derivative/Taylor framework can supply a clean lemma (“remainder is divisible by \\(x^2\\)”) and can help interpret \\(B_k\\) as \\(F_k'(0)\\), potentially simplifying coefficient recurrences. Approach 2 should be treated as a heuristic guide rather than the main route unless the intended solution explicitly allows invoking \\(2\\)-adic dynamics/cycle-lifting theorems; otherwise it risks becoming an exercise in rebuilding that theory, which is more work than needed here. A productive workflow is: try Approach 3’s inductive affine approximation; if the modulus bookkeeping becomes too tight, import from Approach 1 the derivative viewpoint to control the linear coefficient and remainder systematically."

The dominance argument is correct and reusable.\n\n- **EBB-ID-INDUCTB_B03:** (Lemma 2, Step 2) The derivative-composition computation\n  \\[\n  B_{k+1}=F_k'(A_k)\\,B_k\n  \\]\n  together with the differentiated Taylor form giving\n  \\[\n  F_k'(A_k)\\equiv B_k\\pmod{2A_k},\n  \\]\n  hence\n  \\[\n  B_{k+1}\\equiv B_k^2\\pmod{2A_k},\n  \\]\n  is solid and is the key to the sharp valuation \\(v_2(B_{k+1}-1)=k+2\\).\n\n- **EBB-ID-DOMINANCEVAL04:** (Section 4) If \\(v_2(T_1)=m\\) with \\(T_1/2^m\\) odd and \\(v_2(T_2)\\ge m+1\\), then \\(v_2(T_1+T_2)=m\\). You applied this correctly with \\(T_1=(B_k-1)A_k\\) and \\(T_2=A_k^2C_k(A_k)\\).\n\n## Gap assessment\n\nThe problem solver claimed “Gaps: None.” I agree: all key steps needed for the sharp valuation (including the “not divisible by the next power of 2”) are handled, and the critical parity/oddness certificates are explicitly tracked.\n\n## Coverage assessment\n\nAll subparts addressed: Yes.\n\nYou proved the equivalent valuation statement\n\\[\nv_2(x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k})=2k+3\n\\]\nfor all \\(k\\ge 1\\), and correctly translated it back to the original statement for \\(b_n\\).\n\n## Summary\n\nThe solution is correct, well-structured, and appropriately rigorous for an olympiad/number theory setting. The normalization \\(x_n=2b_n\\) is correct and simplifies the recurrence to the polynomial dynamical system \\(x_{n+1}=x_n^2+x_n+2\\). The introduction of iterates \\(F_k=f^{2^k}\\), constants \\(A_k=F_k(0)\\), and multipliers \\(B_k=F_k'(0)\\) is exactly the right framework.\n\nLemma 1 (the integer Taylor expansion \\(F_k(x)=A_k+B_kx+x^2C_k(x)\\)) is fully rigorous and is used correctly to control error terms. Lemma 2 is the core: you prove *sharp* valuations with oddness data, not merely lower bounds, which is essential to establish “not divisible by the next power of 2.” Both inductive steps are correctly justified, including the subtler derivative congruence mod \\(2A_k\\). Finally, the concluding valuation computation cleanly separates the dominant term and the higher-valuation error term, preventing cancellation.\n\nOverall, this is a complete solution with only minor presentation-level tightenings possible.\n\n## Recommendations for next iteration\n\n1. **Make the modulus comparisons explicit** in two places:  \n   - In Lemma 2 Step 1: explicitly write \\(2k+4\\ge k+4\\) for \\(k\\ge 1\\).  \n   - In Lemma 2 Step 2: explicitly write \\(v_2(2A_k)=k+3\\), hence congruence mod \\(2A_k\\) implies congruence mod \\(2^{k+3}\\).\n\n2. **Add one sentence explaining why no cancellation is possible** in Section 4: namely, \\((B_k-1)A_k/2^{2k+3}\\) is odd while the other term is divisible by \\(2^{2k+4}\\).\n\n3. **(Optional stylistic improvement)**: State upfront that the proof’s essence is showing\n   \\[\n   v_2(A_k)=k+2,\\qquad v_2(B_k-1)=k+1,\n   \\]\n   since then the final valuation is their sum.\n\n## Meta-level guidance for both the problem solver and the orchestrator\n\n### Strategy-level assessment\nThe overall approach (hybrid of affine/Taylor control plus iterate-composition) is fundamentally sound and well-matched to the statement. It stays elementary while still capturing the \\(2\\)-adic “linear term dominates” phenomenon. It is not overcomplicated; in fact it is close to optimal given the need for *exact* \\(2\\)-adic valuations.\n\n### Structural blockers\nNone identified (no `MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-*`).\n\n### Dead directions / approaches to abandon\nNone. (No `DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-*` needed.)\n\n### Promising lines and subproblems\nNot applicable: the solution is already complete. If one wanted extensions, natural subproblems would be:\n- determine \\(v_2(b_n)\\) for general \\(n\\),\n- analyze \\(b_{m+n}-\\alpha b_m\\) for other linear combinations and powers of 2,\nbut these are beyond the current task.\n\n### Recommendations for the orchestrator\n1. **Treat Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 as established and reusable** (EBB-ID-TAYLORZINT01, EBB-ID-INDUCTA_B02, EBB-ID-INDUCTB_B03).\n2. **Do not spawn extra research phases**; the proof is complete and elementary.\n3. If polishing is desired, request only minor exposition improvements (explicit inequality checks and the non-cancellation remark).\n\n## Research flag\n\nResearch needed: No.\n\n## Updated Registry of IDs\n\n- **EBB-ID-TAYLORZINT01:** Integer Taylor expansion \\(P(x)=P(0)+P'(0)x+x^2Q(x)\\) for \\(P\\in\\mathbb Z[x]\\).\n- **EBB-ID-INDUCTA_B02:** Inductive extraction of \\(v_2(A_{k+1})\\) from \\(A_{k+1}=A_k(1+B_k)+A_k^2C_k(A_k)\\).\n- **EBB-ID-INDUCTB_B03:** Inductive extraction of \\(v_2(B_{k+1}-1)\\) via \\(B_{k+1}=F_k'(A_k)B_k\\) and \\(F_k'(A_k)\\equiv B_k\\pmod{2A_k}\\).\n- **EBB-ID-DOMINANCEVAL04:** Dominance lemma for valuations preventing cancellation when one term has strictly higher \\(2\\)-adic valuation."

It follows that\\n\\\\[\\n v_2(A_{k+1})=k+3\\n\\\\]\\nand \\\\(A_{k+1}/2^{k+3}\\\\) is odd.\\n\\n**Step 2: valuation of \\\\(B_{k+1}-1\\\\).** By the chain rule and \\\\(F_{k+1}=F_k\\\\circ F_k\\\\),\\n\\\\[\\nB_{k+1}=F_{k+1}'(0)=F_k'(F_k(0))\\\\,F_k'(0)=F_k'(A_k)\\\\,B_k.\\n\\\\]\\nDifferentiate Lemma 1:\\n\\\\[\\nF_k'(x)=B_k+2xC_k(x)+x^2C_k'(x)=B_k+x\\\\bigl(2C_k(x)+xC_k'(x)\\\\bigr).\\n\\\\]\\nEvaluating at \\\\(x=A_k\\\\) gives\\n\\\\[\\nF_k'(A_k)-B_k=A_k\\\\bigl(2C_k(A_k)+A_kC_k'(A_k)\\\\bigr).\\n\\\\]\\nThe bracket is even (it is a sum of two even integers), so\\n\\\\[\\nF_k'(A_k)\\\\equiv B_k\\\\pmod{2A_k}.\\n\\\\]\\nSince \\\\(B_k\\\\) is odd (indeed \\\\(B_k\\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod 2\\\\)), multiplying the congruence by \\\\(B_k\\\\) preserves the modulus, and we obtain\\n\\\\[\\nB_{k+1}=F_k'(A_k)B_k\\\\equiv B_k^2\\\\pmod{2A_k}.\\n\\\\]\\nNow \\\\(v_2(2A_k)=1+v_2(A_k)=1+(k+2)=k+3\\\\), so this implies\\n\\\\[\\nB_{k+1}\\\\equiv B_k^2\\\\pmod{2^{k+3}}.\\n\\\\]\\nWrite \\\\(B_k=1+2^{k+1}v_k\\\\) with \\\\(v_k\\\\) odd.

Hence\\n\\\\[\\nB_k^2\\\\equiv 1+2^{k+2}v_k\\\\pmod{2^{k+3}}.\\n\\\\]\\nTherefore\\n\\\\[\\nB_{k+1}\\\\equiv 1+2^{k+2}v_k\\\\pmod{2^{k+3}},\\n\\\\]\\nwhich shows \\\\(v_2(B_{k+1}-1)=k+2\\\\) and \\\\((B_{k+1}-1)/2^{k+2}\\\\) is odd.\\n\\nThe induction is complete. ∎\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4) The exact valuation of \\\\(x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k}\\\\)\\nFor \\\\(k\\\\ge 1\\\\), note \\\\(x_{2^k}=A_k\\\\) and \\\\(x_{2^{k+1}}=A_{k+1}=F_k(A_k)\\\\). Using Lemma 1,\\n\\\\[\\nA_{k+1}=F_k(A_k)=A_k+B_kA_k+A_k^2C_k(A_k).\\n\\\\]\\nHence\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k}\\n &=A_{k+1}-2A_k\\n =(B_k-1)A_k + A_k^2C_k(A_k).\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\]\\nBy Lemma 2,\\n\\\\[\\n v_2\\\\bigl((B_k-1)A_k\\\\bigr)=v_2(B_k-1)+v_2(A_k)=(k+1)+(k+2)=2k+3,\\n\\\\]\\nand moreover \\\\((B_k-1)A_k/2^{2k+3}\\\\) is odd (product of two odd integers).\\n\\nAlso,\\n\\\\[\\n v_2\\\\bigl(A_k^2C_k(A_k)\\\\bigr)\\\\ge v_2(A_k^2)=2(k+2)=2k+4.\\n\\\\]\\nSo the second term is divisible by \\\\(2^{2k+4}\\\\), while the first term is divisible by exactly \\\\(2^{2k+3}\\\\). Therefore there is no cancellation at the \\\\(2^{2k+3}\\\\) level, and\\n\\\\[\\n v_2\\\\bigl(x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k}\\\\bigr)=2k+3.\\n\\\\]\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5) Return to \\\\(b_n\\\\)\\nFinally,\\n\\\\[\\n x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k}=2\\\\bigl(b_{2^{k+1}}-2b_{2^k}\\\\bigr),\\n\\\\]\\nso\\n\\\\[\\n v_2\\\\bigl(b_{2^{k+1}}-2b_{2^k}\\\\bigr)=v_2\\\\bigl(x_{2^{k+1}}-2x_{2^k}\\\\bigr)-1=(2k+3)-1=2k+2.\\n\\\\]\\nThus \\\\(b_{2^{k+1}}-2b_{2^k}\\\\) is divisible by \\\\(2^{2k+2}\\\\) but not by \\\\(2^{2k+3}\\\\), as required. ∎\\n\",\"draft_markdown\":\"\",\"user_requests\":[],\"state_summary\":{\"next_solution_attempt_number\":2,\"latest_expert_solution_evaluator_status\":\"Solved\",\"unresolved_major_issue_ids\":[],\"plateau_detected\":false}}"
