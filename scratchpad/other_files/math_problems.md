**Problems of the 2024 Schweitzer Miklós Memorial Mathematical Competition**
2024 October 25 – 2024 November 4

**1.** Let (G = (S, T; E)) be a finite bipartite graph with a perfect matching. Prove that there exists an injective edge-weighting (w : E \to \mathbb{R}) satisfying the following:

1. If for each vertex (s \in S) the edge (e_s) is the incident edge of smallest weight, then ({e_s \mid s \in S}) is a perfect matching in (G).

2. If for each vertex (t \in T) the edge (e_t) is the incident edge of largest weight, then ({e_t \mid t \in T}) is a perfect matching in (G).

**2.** Does there exist a nowhere dense, nonempty compact set (C \subset [0,1]) such that for every point (x \in C) one has
[
\liminf_{h \to 0^+} \frac{\lambda\big(C \cap (x, x+h)\big)}{h} > 0
\quad\text{or}\quad
\liminf_{h \to 0^+} \frac{\lambda\big(C \cap (x-h, x)\big)}{h} > 0,
]
where (\lambda(A)) denotes the Lebesgue measure of the set (A)?

---

**3.** Do there exist continuous nowhere differentiable functions (f, g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}) such that the composition (f \circ g) is differentiable?

---

**4.** Let (\pi) be a given permutation of the set ({1,2,\dots,n}). Determine the smallest possible value of
[
\sum_{i=1}^n \bigl|\pi(i) - \sigma(i)\bigr|
]
when (\sigma) is chosen from among the (n)-cycles (i.e. permutations consisting of a single cycle of length (n)). Express the answer in terms of the numbers and lengths of the cycles appearing in the decomposition of (\pi) into a product of disjoint cycles (including 1-cycles).

---

**5.** Let (X) be a regular topological space and let (S) be a countably compact dense subspace of (X). (Countably compact here means that every infinite subset of (S) has an accumulation point in (S).) Show that then (S) is also (G_\delta)-dense in (X), that is, it intersects every nonempty (G_\delta) subset of (X).

**6.** In a heat propagation process, we say that at a point (x \in \mathbb{R}^n) the evolution of the temperature is *astonishing* (or *startling*) if it changes monotonicity infinitely many times.

Is it possible that the evolution of the temperature is astonishing at every point of (\mathbb{R}^n)?

That is: does there exist a nonnegative function
[
u \in C^2\big((0,+\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^n\big)
]
solving the heat equation
[
\partial_t u - \Delta u = 0
]
such that (u(t,x) \to 0) as (|x| \to \infty) for any fixed (t), and for every (x \in \mathbb{R}^n) there exists a monotone sequence ((t_k)) of positive numbers with
[
(-1)^k ,\partial_t u(t_k, x) > 0 \quad \text{for all } k?
]

---

**7.** Is it true that if a subgroup of (\operatorname{Sym}(\mathbb{N})) is (n)-transitive for every positive integer (n), then every group automorphism of this subgroup extends to a group automorphism of (\operatorname{Sym}(\mathbb{N}))?

---

**8.** Prove that for any finite bipartite planar graph, one can assign to each vertex a circle in the plane so that any two circles corresponding to adjacent vertices are tangent to each other, while any two circles corresponding to distinct nonadjacent vertices intersect in two points.

---

**9.** Let (q > 1) be a power of (2). Let
[
f : \mathbb{F}*{q^2} \to \mathbb{F}*{q^2}
]
be an affine map over (\mathbb{F}_2). Show that the equation
[
f(x) = x^{q+1}
]
has at most (2q - 1) solutions.

---

**10.** Let (A > 0) and let
[
B = (3 + 2\sqrt{2})A.
]
Show that in the finite sequence
[
a_k = \big\lfloor k/\sqrt{2} \big\rfloor
\quad\text{for } k \in (A,B) \cap \mathbb{Z},
]
the numbers of even and odd terms differ by at most (2).

---

**11.** An urn initially contains one red and one blue ball. At each step we draw one ball at random from the urn, with the uniform distribution over the balls currently in the urn.

* If the ball drawn is red, we place one additional red and one additional blue ball into the urn.
* When we draw a blue ball for the (k)-th time, we place one blue and (2k+1) red balls into the urn.

(The drawn balls are not removed; they remain in the urn.)

Let (G_n) denote the number of balls in the urn after (n) steps. Prove that there exist constants (0 < c, \alpha < \infty) such that with probability (1) we have
[
\frac{G_n}{n^\alpha} \longrightarrow c.
]

All those may participate in the Schweitzer Miklós Memorial Competition who, at the time of the competition, are students of a university or college in Hungary, or who, as Hungarian citizens abroad, are students of a university or college, or who are secondary school pupils, or who obtained their university or college diploma in the year of the competition. PhD students may participate only if they obtained their university or college diploma in the year of the competition.

Those are excluded from the competition who obtained, earlier than the year of the competition, an MSc-level degree in mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, program designer mathematics, or mathematics teaching, either in Hungary or abroad.

This year the contestants have 10 days to solve the problems. Solutions may be submitted only electronically to the address **[schweitzer.miklos@gmail.com](mailto:schweitzer.miklos@gmail.com)** by **4 November 2024 (Monday), 12:00 (noon) Hungarian time**, indicating the contestant’s name, university, year of study, qualification, exact postal address and e-mail address. If possible, we ask that the solutions be sent in a single e-mail, in separate files for each problem, in PDF format (in the case of scanned documents, clearly legible) and written in Hungarian. In exceptional cases, after prior consultation, we will also accept solutions written in English. The competition committee will not consider papers submitted in any other way or after the deadline.

Contestants may submit solutions to any number of the proposed problems. Among the winners, the Society will award the Schweitzer Miklós Prizes. Anyone who solves at least three problems will in any case receive a prize or a certificate of recognition.

The problems must be solved independently by the contestants. Cooperation between contestants is not permitted. The use of the Internet is allowed only in a passive way, i.e. searching is permitted, but it is forbidden to ask any questions on any forum. If it comes to the attention of the competition committee that a contestant has violated this requirement, that person will be excluded from the competition.

We ask everyone not to give any help to the contestants in solving the mathematical problems, and not to engage in any discussion with them concerning the solution of the problems until the submission deadline has passed. We further ask that if anyone becomes aware of an irregularity of this nature, they immediately notify the competition committee at the above address.

This year the joint discussion of the solutions will take place on **5 November 2024 (Tuesday) at 16:00 Hungarian time**, at the Lágymányos campus of Eötvös Loránd University (1117 Budapest, Pázmány Péter sétány 1/C), in room 3-517. Information about the time and manner of the announcement of results will later be provided at the following link:

[https://www.bolyai.hu/versenyek-schweitzer-miklos-emlekverseny](https://www.bolyai.hu/versenyek-schweitzer-miklos-emlekverseny)

At the same place, after the joint discussion, we will publish the unofficial preliminary solution outlines. After the announcement of results, each contestant may request by e-mail to **[schweitzer.miklos@gmail.com](mailto:schweitzer.miklos@gmail.com)** that we inform them which of their submitted solutions we considered complete, essentially correct, partially solved, or incorrect.

We wish you successful problem solving!
**The Competition Committee**
