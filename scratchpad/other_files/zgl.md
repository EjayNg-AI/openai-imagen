You are an expert in Gen Alpha slang.

Give me a run down of all the Gen Alpha slang in use today, together with example usage for each slang in real life situations.

You can’t get a *literally complete* list of “all Gen Alpha slang in use today” because:

- it changes week-to-week (micro‑memes die fast),
- it’s platform- and region-specific (TikTok vs Roblox vs YouTube vs school hallway),
- and a lot of “Gen Alpha slang” is actually **templates** (mix‑and‑match phrases) more than fixed dictionary words.

What I *can* do is give you a **high-coverage rundown of the slang that’s still broadly recognizable and actively used as of Saturday, December 13, 2025**, plus **real-life example usage for each**. Meanings below are synthesized from major dictionary/linguistics writeups and mainstream reporting (especially Merriam‑Webster’s slang pages, Dictionary.com’s slang explainers, AP/Guardian/Vox reporting, and Wikipedia’s trend summaries).

## How Gen Alpha slang is actually used (so you can decode new phrases)

Gen Alpha often speaks in **templates** you can plug words into. Once you know the templates, you can understand brand-new phrases you’ve never heard before.

### 1) The “stacked phrase” template (word salad on purpose)
Example pattern:
- **[skibidi] [Ohio] [rizz/sigma/NPC]**
Meaning:
- “This is chaotic/weird/awkward” (often joking, sometimes insulting). ([merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/skibidi?utm_source=openai))

**Real-life example:**  
*Friend watches someone flirt badly:* “That was **skibidi Ohio rizz**.”

### 2) The “points system” template
- “+10 aura points” / “-50 aura points” ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jun/06/explain-it-to-me-quickly-what-is-aura-farming-and-is-it-cool-or-cringe?utm_source=openai))  
**Real-life example:** *You hold the door for three people:* “Okay, +20 aura points.”

### 3) The “state of being” template
- “He’s **cooked**.” / “I’m **locked in**.” ([merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/cooked?utm_source=openai))  
**Real-life example:** *Two assignments due:* “I’m **locked in** all weekend.”

## If you want, I can tailor this to your exact context
Because “Gen Alpha slang” changes by platform, tell me where you’re hearing it (pick any):

1) middle school hallway  
2) Roblox / Fortnite / Minecraft  
3) TikTok comments  
4) YouTube shorts  
5) group chats

…and I’ll rewrite the glossary to match that environment (including the most common *combo phrases* and when they’re compliments vs insults).

Zhuge Liang submitted two famous petitions (memorials) to the Shu emperor Liu Shan known as the Chu Shi Biao (出師表) before launching his Northern Expeditions against the rival state of Cao Wei. Write them in English, in Gen Alpha lingo.

Below are **Gen Alpha–style remixes** of Zhuge Liang’s two “Chu Shi Biao” memorials:

- **First Memorial (前出師表)** — the one where he’s basically like: *“Your dad built this, please govern properly, trust the right people, I’m going north, I might not come back.”*
- **Later/Second Memorial (後出師表)** — the one where he doubles down like: *“I’m still locked in, can’t stop, restoring Han is the whole mission, please keep the court solid while I’m gone.”*

These are **not literal translations**; they’re faithful-to-the-message **English rewrites in Gen Alpha lingo**.

---

## 1) The First Chu Shi Biao (Before the Northern Expeditions) — Gen Alpha Remix

Your Majesty,

Real talk: the Han situation is in that fragile era right now. The empire is basically split, everybody’s watching us, and if we fumble, we’re cooked.

Back when the late Emperor (your father) was still here, he wasn’t born with some free “W” handed to him. He had to grind through nonstop chaos to get us even this far. Now he’s gone, and you’re the one holding the controller.

So here’s the main quest: **keep the court stable, keep people loyal, and don’t let weirdos run the timeline**.

### 1) Please run the kingdom like you actually want it to live
I’m begging you: don’t lock yourself in the palace and treat this like a side quest. This is the whole game. When people are loyal and competent, you reward them. When people are corrupt or shady, you punish them. Simple.

If rewards and punishments are random, biased, or based on vibes, everyone loses trust and the whole state gets negative aura.

### 2) Use the right people (and don’t ignore the ones who are actually W)
The late Emperor left behind good ministers and generals for a reason. People like:

- **Guo Youzhi, Fei Yi, Dong Yun** (solid court people)
- and the generals who can actually hold lines and keep order

These aren’t NPCs. These are your proven teammates.

So please:
- **listen to them**
- **ask them questions**
- **let them cook**
- and don’t treat good advice like it’s mid just because it’s not what you feel like hearing.

Also: if someone is loyal and useful, don’t let them get iced out by petty drama. And if someone is fake-loyal, don’t keep them close just because they’re loud.

### 3) Remember what your dad was trying to do
Your father wasn’t building Shu for fun. He was trying to restore the Han and stop the chaos from becoming permanent.

He trusted me with this mission, and no cap, that trust is heavy. I’m not some random who showed up for clout.

I was literally just a nobody in the countryside, minding my business. The late Emperor pulled up personally, asked for my help, and treated me like I mattered. That kindness? I can’t repay it by sitting comfortably while the state falls apart.

### 4) My plan: I’m going north, and I’m going all-in
So here’s what I’m asking:

Let me lead the expedition north against Wei.

Not because I think it’s easy, but because if we don’t do it, we’re basically agreeing to lose forever. Our resources are limited; our window is limited. This is the moment to lock in.

While I’m gone:
- keep the court clean,
- keep good people in place,
- keep discipline,
- and don’t let small-minded politics sabotage the entire country.

### 5) If I fail, blame me—not the good ministers
If I mess up, that’s on me. If you notice officials being lazy, corrupt, or incompetent, don’t just sigh and move on—deal with it.

And if the people I recommended turn out to be frauds, then yeah, I deserve the L for recommending them. But if they’re actually loyal and capable, then trust them.

Your father put this country in your hands. I’m putting my life into this campaign.

I’m leaving now.

Respectfully submitted,  
Zhuge Liang

## 2) The Later/Second Chu Shi Biao (Afterward) — Gen Alpha Remix

Your Majesty,

I already wrote you once, but I’m writing again because this mission isn’t a trend. It’s not something you do for a season and then drop. This is a vow.

I know people are tired. I know the state is strained. I know some folks are like, “Can we chill and defend instead?”

But me? I can’t chill.

### 1) I can’t log off from this mission
Ever since the late Emperor entrusted me with the plan to restore the Han, I’ve basically been living in permanent “locked in” mode.

Even when I’m exhausted, even when the odds look bad, I can’t just sit back and watch Wei grow stronger. If we stall forever, we lose slowly. If we move, we at least have a chance to win.

So yeah: I’m still asking to go north again.

### 2) This isn’t about ego—it’s about responsibility
I’m not doing this to look like a sigma war genius in the history books. I’m doing it because the late Emperor treated me with real trust and gave me a purpose.

If I stopped trying now, I’d be betraying that trust.

People might say: “But what if you fail?”

And I’m like: I might. But if I don’t even try, that’s an automatic fail.

### 3) Your part while I’m gone: keep your judgment clean
While I’m at the front:

- Don’t let flattery glitch your thinking.
- Don’t let petty rivalries decide appointments.
- Don’t let corrupt people stack power just because they’re good at talking.

Be fair. Be consistent. Keep the rules the rules.

When officials do good, reward them clearly. When they do wrong, punish them clearly. If you let favoritism run things, the whole government gets weird and everyone starts acting like it’s “every man for himself.”

### 4) Trust the solid ministers; don’t drift into isolation
You’ve got capable people around you. Use them. Consult them. Let them do their jobs.

A ruler who isolates himself becomes easy to manipulate. Then the court becomes a mess. Then the state collapses from inside even if the army fights well outside.

### 5) If I die out there, don’t let the mission die with me
I’m not saying this for drama—this is just reality.

If I succeed, it’s a W for Shu and for the Han cause.  
If I fail, then I at least went down doing what I promised.

But whatever happens to me, you must keep the state upright:
- honor the late Emperor’s legacy,
- use worthy people,
- protect the people,
- and don’t let the whole cause get abandoned because it’s hard.

I’m going north again.

Respectfully submitted,  
Zhuge Liang

### If you want it even more “Gen Alpha”
I kept these **readable** and “court-memorial shaped,” just with Gen Alpha diction layered in. If you want a *harder* slang version (more “bruh / ratio / cooked / aura points / NPC” density) tell me the vibe you want:

1) **“Still formal, just modern”** (what I did)  
2) **“Full TikTok comments section”**  
3) **“Roblox lobby speech”**  
4) **“Group chat voice note”**

And I’ll rewrite them in that exact register.
