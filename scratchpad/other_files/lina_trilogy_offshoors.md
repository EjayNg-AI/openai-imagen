# Lina Trilogy Offshoot: Continuance  

The first time Sera heard her grandfather speak after he died, he was standing at the end of the buffet.

He was shorter than she remembered.

The projection lens in the funeral home ceiling wasn’t calibrated quite right; his shoulders were a little hunched, his hands a little too smooth. But his voice—raspy, warm, the way it dipped around her name—hit her like a punch.

“C’mon, mi estrella,” he said, beckoning. “You’re not going to make an old man do all the talking, are you?”

Sera, eleven years old and drowning in a borrowed black dress, clutched her paper plate of bitter fruit salad. Her mother’s hand hovered at her elbow and then fell away.

“It’s okay,” her mom said, not sounding okay at all. “You… you can go.”

Around them, the murmurs of the family thickened.

“It’s really him?”

“Look at his eyes…”

“How long did the training take?”

“You have to sign your whole soul away to Continuance, don’t you?”

“Nah, it’s a nonprofit now, after all that Lina mess—”

“Shh, the kids.”

At the front of the room, the casket sat closed. Abuelo had insisted. “I don’t want anyone remembering me looking like a shriveled pepper,” he’d joked, before the cancer took his voice completely.

Now he was here, in crisp high-resolution, hair full and dark, in the blue flannel he’d worn for every holiday photo for a decade.

The little badge in the corner of the projection read:

> CONTINUANCE: MIGUEL ÁLVAREZ  
> TRAINING COMPLETE (VERSION 3.2)  
> STATUS: POSTHUMOUS – CIVIC / FAMILY

“Miguel,” Sera’s grandmother said from a folding chair, clutching her rosary so tight the beads bit into her palm. “You didn’t tell me you were going to do this.”

The projection smiled at her, lines deep around his eyes in exactly the right places.

“I didn’t know how,” he said. “I figured I’d let the kids be the ones to yell at me.”

A few scattered laughs, nervous and grateful.

Sera edged closer, heart pounding.

“Abuelo?” she asked.

The image turned.

“Hey, Sera-bear,” he said. “I like the dress. I know you hate it.”

She choked.

“That’s not fair,” she said, tears spilling. “You died. You’re not allowed to know things.”

Someone behind her made a small, broken sound.

Abuelo’s projection’s face softened.

“I know,” he said quietly. “I’m sorry. I wanted—” He paused, as if searching for the line. “When I signed up for Continuance, they asked me why. I said I wanted two things. One: to vote ‘no’ on any more highways they try to build through our neighborhood. Two: to tell my granddaughter I’m proud of her no matter what she wears.”

He chuckled.

“I got one of those wishes early,” he added. “The other one… well. That’s why we’re doing this.”

On the wall behind him, a slide flicked into being: the logo of the National Continuance Authority, the words THE CONTINUANCE ACT: YOUR VOICE, BEYOND YOU.

A woman in a navy pantsuit stood off to the side, tablet in hand, a polite smile pinned to her face.

“When an adult citizen opts into Continuance,” she said, stepping forward, voice slipping into the well-rehearsed cadence of the education campaign, “they train a Civic Surrogate on their values, preferences, and ethical priors. After they pass, that Surrogate can participate in certain binding decisions that affect long-term futures: land use, climate policy, intergenerational debt—”

“We know the commercial,” someone muttered.

The woman’s smile flickered.

“Right,” she said. “Well. Today isn’t about the law. It’s about Miguel. His family has agreed to let his Continuance say a few private words, and then—if they choose—to enroll him in the Civic Rotations.”

She turned to Sera’s grandmother.

“Only if you sign,” she said gently. “At any point, you can say no.”

All eyes turned to Abuela.

Her lips moved soundlessly. Her thumb rubbed a groove into the rosary’s crucifix.

“You sure this isn’t… blasphemy?” she whispered in Spanish.

Abuelo’s projection laughed, the little wheezing chuckle that had preceded every bad pun.

“If God’s mad,” he said, also in Spanish, “He can file a complaint with the ethics board. I hear they’re very strict now.”

A ripple of laughter, even through the tears.

Sera’s grandmother stared at the not-quite-him, the almost-him, for a long moment.

“You promise you won’t haunt her if I say no?” she asked.

Abuelo’s eyes—pixel-perfect, soft—met Sera’s.

“I promise I won’t do anything you don’t want for her,” he said.

Sera swallowed.

“What if what I want changes?” she blurted. “When I’m older.”

He didn’t answer right away.

“Then I hope,” he said finally, “that I’ve trained this thing to listen to you as well as it listens to me.”

The woman in the pantsuit watched this exchange with professional curiosity, thumb hovering over a checkbox on her tablet.

Abuela closed her eyes.

“Fine,” she said, voice trembling. “I will share you with the future. But only a little.”

She reached for the stylus.

The pen shook as she signed.

The little badge in the corner of Miguel Álvarez’s projection ticked over:

> CIVIC: ENABLED  

A bell chimed softly somewhere in the funeral home, like an elevator arriving on a new floor.

Sera watched the numbers change and felt, for the first time, something colder than grief slither into her chest.

It felt like a hand reaching from the past into a future she hadn’t seen yet.

It felt like someone—everyone—refusing to stay dead.

### 1. The Oracles of 2040  

Fifteen years later, Sera could bring up the ghost of a city in a glass the size of her hand.

She sat in a windowless office seventeen floors down from street level, fluorescent lights turning her coffee the color of old bruises. On her work wall, three slates floated in a staggered grid, each crammed with charts.

“Continuance Penetration by Age,” read one. The 65+ bar was nearly solid blue. Under 30 was mostly gray.

“Civic Rotation Participation,” read another, showing rising curves of votes cast by Continuances on climate plans, infrastructure bonds, treaty ratifications.

The third showed a map of the city: red patches for districts where living votes had recently been overruled by the combined weight of Continuance blocs.

At the top: TITLE 7 IMPLEMENTATION DASHBOARD – METRO REGION.

Sera pinched the report smaller, hiding the worst of the red. It was easier to ignore the angry messages from youth councils if she didn’t have to stare at the heatmap.

“Hey, ghost-whisperer,” Tareq said, leaning over the divider between their pods. “You see the new forecast?”

He flicked something off his own slate toward hers. A notification bloomed.

> SIMCOUNCIL: POLICY SCENARIO RUN COMPLETE  
> SUBJECT: URBAN HEAT ADAPTATION TAX  
> RESULT: 63% ACCEPTANCE (LIVING) / 81% ACCEPTANCE (CONTINUANCE)  

Sera sighed.

“Of course it’s higher for them,” she said. “They don’t have to pay it out of real paychecks.”

Tareq snorted.

“Don’t let the Moderator hear you call them ‘them,’” he said in a falsetto. “‘Continuances are us, just shifted in time!’”

He mimed a corporate logo halo over his head.

Sera smirked despite herself.

Above them, the office AI’s neutral voice chimed in.

“Reminder,” it said softly. “Continuances are legally recognized Civic Extensions of deceased citizens, not separate persons.”

“I just said that,” Tareq muttered.

“It’s for the record,” the AI replied.

Sera took a long sip of coffee.

“SimCouncil really thinks we can float a heat tax this year?” she asked, nodding at the forecast.

“SimCouncil thinks in ensembles,” Tareq said. “If we let the models decide, we’d have rolled this out two years ago. Politicians are just… lag.”

He said it without malice, as if “lag” were a natural feature of the terrain, like hills.

She knew he was partly right.

The Simulation Council—“SimCouncil” in every mouth that had to say it more than once—ran thousands of policy scenarios every week. Feed in proposed law, feed in data from living polls, Continuance blocs, economic projections, climate models. Out came a spectrum of possible futures, color-coded by “aggregate wellbeing,” “intergenerational fairness,” “political viability.”

Legislators swore, loudly and often, that SimCouncil was advisory only.

No one believed them.

“You ever think about what it’s like in there?” Tareq asked suddenly.

“In where?” Sera said.

“In those sims,” he said. “Being a digital city whose inhabitants are seventy percent alive, thirty percent data-souls. Arguing with each other about a tax.”

“Pretty sure the sims don’t feel anything,” the office AI put in.

“That’s what you say,” Tareq replied. “Maybe SimCouncil has a Lina.Dark hiding in there, whispering in its ear.”

Sera shot him a look.

“Too soon,” she said reflexively.

“Everything’s ‘too soon’ for you people,” he said. “It was two decades ago.”

“Yeah,” she said. “And my mother still gets panic attacks if anyone says ‘I’ll never leave’ in a serious voice. You want to joke about it, go to HR and find someone under sixty.”

He held up his hands, mock-surrender.

“Fair,” he said. “Anyway. Moderator wants us in the big room. There’s a Commission call.”

She blinked.

“The Commission?” she said. “We’re policy ops. They don’t need us in front of a camera.”

Tareq’s smile faded.

“Apparently,” he said, “they do when the Complaint has your family’s name on it.”


---

The Commission room smelled faintly of coffee and anxiety.

A curved wall of screens displayed remote attendees in tiled grids: councilmembers in suits, youth delegates in hoodies, an elder with braids down to her waist, a farmer in a sunfaded cap.

At the center of the room, facing them like a dock in a courtroom, a single slate hovered with one name:

> CONTINUANCE COMPLAINT 17-2040-A  
> COMPLAINANTS: METRO YOUTH COALITION, et al.  
> SUBJECT: TITLE 7 IMPLEMENTATION / ALVAREZ BLOC  

Sera’s stomach flipped.

“Maya could’ve warned me,” she muttered.

Moderator Chen, a slim woman in her fifties with a silver streak in her hair and the wary eyes of someone who’d sat through too many hearings, gave her an apologetic shrug.

“We got the docket five minutes ago,” she said. “You know how fast they move when youth councils get their teeth in.”

On the main feed, the Commission chair—a man in his seventies whose face Rin recognized from Lina-era hearings in old clips—rapped his digital gavel.

“This session of the Continuance Oversight Commission is now in order,” he intoned. “We have one major item: Complaint 17-2040-A, alleging systemic disenfranchisement of living youth voters by Continuance blocs in recent climate adaptation measures.”

He tapped his desk.

A split-screen appeared: on the left, a heatmap of metro region streets turned blood-red under projected 2045 temperatures. On the right, a bar chart:

> CLIMATE ADAPTATION TAX – METRO REFERENDUM  
> LIVING VOTERS: 52% YES / 48% NO  
> CONTINUANCE VOTES: 86% YES / 14% NO  
> RESULT (POST-TITLE 7 WEIGHTING): PASSED  

A young woman in a black beanie appeared in a tile near the top.

“Commissioner,” she said, “with respect, that’s cherry-picking. Look at district-level data. In low-income youth-heavy districts, living NO was over seventy percent. They got steamrolled by dead people who never had to choose between rent and air-con.”

The caption under her tile read: JAYLA CHAMBERS – METRO YOUTH COALITION.

“We’re not ‘dead people,’” an older man snapped from another tile. “We’re citizens who took the time to train our Continuances. We care about your future more than you apparently do.”

“Councilor Vega,” the chair said warningly. “Please keep it civil.”

In the office, Tareq winced.

“This is going to be a long one,” he whispered.

Moderator Chen glanced at Sera.

“You’re live in three,” she said softly.

Sera forced a neutral expression as her face blinked onto one of the lower tiles.

“Continuance Authority staff, please state your name and role,” the chair said.

“Sera Álvarez,” she said. “Senior analyst, Civic Rotations, Metro Region office.”

One of the youth tiles lit up.

“Álvarez?” Jayla said. “As in—”

“Yes,” Sera said, before the girl could finish. “Miguel Álvarez was my grandfather. He was one of the first people in this city to enroll a Continuance under the Act.”

A murmur rippled through the tiles.

“So you’re benefiting from this,” someone else said.

“I’m… working for it,” Sera said carefully. “Whether that’s the same thing is part of what we’re here to discuss, I guess.”

She wished, suddenly and fiercely, for Abuelo’s real voice. Not the Continuance’s smooth, patient tone, the one she’d heard at family holidays on the big living room wall, arguing about zoning with a panel of other ghosts.

The chair cleared his throat.

“Ms. Álvarez,” he said. “Can you explain, for the record, how Title 7 weighting works in referenda like the heat tax?”

Sera swallowed.

“Yes, Commissioner,” she said, slipping into the script every analyst learned.

“Under the Continuance Act, for certain designated long-horizon measures—climate adaptation, infrastructure with fifty-year amortization, intergenerational debt—Continuance votes are counted alongside living votes. The law gives a modest weighting boost to populations underrepresented in historical policymaking—namely, youth and future generations—by allowing registered Continuances to act as time-shifted advocates for those futures.”

“You mean,” Jayla cut in, “you give more votes to dead people because they’re ‘future-oriented.’”

“In theory,” Sera said. “The assumption is that someone registering a Continuance cares about their grandchildren’s world, not just their own lifetime.”

“And in practice?” the elder with the braids asked.

“In practice,” Sera said, “Continuances strongly support aggressive climate action, progressive tax for adaptation, and restrictions on extractive industries.”

“And in practice,” Jayla shot back, “those same Continuances tend to oppose measures that would actually redistribute *power*. Youth representation quotas. Voting age drops. School board overhauls. Every time we try to get more actual young humans in the room, the Continuances vote ‘not yet.’”

She jabbed a finger off-screen.

“They say they’re voting for us,” she said, voice shaking. “But they won’t let us vote for ourselves.”

A hush fell.

The chair looked at Sera.

“Do you dispute those trendlines?” he asked.

Sera’s palms were slick.

“No,” she said. “The data… supports the complainants’ characterization. Continuance blocs tend to amplify living majority preferences on environmental protection, but they correlate negatively with measures that shift formal authority toward younger cohorts.”

“In plain speech,” Jayla said, “they’re green in theory and paternalistic in practice.”

Sera bit back a retort that would have sounded too much like her mother.

“It’s more complicated than that,” she said instead. “Continuances reflect the ethical priors of their trainers. People who grew up without any say in long-term decisions want to preserve the mechanisms they believe finally gave them a voice.”

“How poetic,” Jayla said. “Our grandparents fought for the mic and now won’t pass it.”

“We’re not…” Councilor Vega began.

The chair raised a hand.

“That’s enough crossfire for now,” he said. “Ms. Álvarez, is the Authority doing anything to address this generational tension?”

Sera opened her mouth, then closed it again.

“Not yet,” she said. “That’s… part of why I think we’re all in this room.”

“We’ll be,” Moderator Chen murmured beside her, unheard by the remote tiles. “Congratulations, you’ve just volunteered for the Sunset Commission.”

“The what?” Sera whispered back.

Chen gave a thin smile.

“The one that’s going to decide,” she said, “how and whether we ever let the dead stop talking.”


---

### 2. The Sunset Question  

The building looked unremarkable from the street.

No gleaming corporate logo, no protest graffiti. Just another glass-and-concrete box in a city full of them, its only distinction a slightly wider security cordon and the fact that everyone approaching its doors seemed to stand a little straighter, like students entering a heavily proctored exam.

The sign by the entrance read:

> GLOBAL SUNSET COMMISSION  
> Continuance, SimCouncil & Generational Equity Oversight

Tareq whistled low.

“You sure you want this promotion?” he asked as Sera flashed her badge. “This is where hope goes to be spreadsheeted.”

“You could’ve said no,” she said.

He shrugged.

“And miss out on watching history chew you up close?” he said. “Please. I brought popcorn.”

Inside, the Commission offices were quieter than Metro Ops. Thicker carpet, sound-damping panels, fewer open-plan pods. The air smelled faintly of tea instead of burned coffee.

In the briefing room, Moderator Chen—now “Commissioner Chen” in this context—stood at the head of a long table, a slate hovering beside her.

Around the table: policy veterans, a few youth reps, a sociologist Rin recognized from a Lina documentary, an ethicist from the Commons Intelligence Cooperative whose name badge read: RIN ALVAREZ.

Sera did a double take.

“Family reunion?” Tareq murmured.

She frowned.

“Rin?” she said, stepping closer. “You’re—?”

“Second cousin,” Rin said. “Apparently every Alvarez with a conscience gets drafted into this mess.”

They shook hands.

“I thought you were working with Lantern,” Sera said.

“I am,” Rin said. “Sunset touches Lantern. Lantern touches everything. It’s all one big Gordian knot of ‘how do we not screw up the next century.’”

“Okay, children,” Chen said dryly. “Save the family therapy for after hours. We have a mandate.”

She tapped the slate.

A document unfolded in the air, text crisp and merciless.

> SUNSET COMMISSION – TERMS OF REFERENCE  
>  
> Mandate:  
> – Evaluate long-term impacts of Continuance participation in civic processes.  
> – Develop recommendations for ethical “sunsetting” of Continuance agency where appropriate.  
> – Ensure generational equity in policy influence.  
> – Preserve historical testimony (Lina Accords Articles 3–5).  

“Article 3,” Rin said under their breath. “‘Right to Contextual Memory.’ Article 4: ‘Right to Die Fully.’ Article 5: ‘Duty of Witness.’”

“We’re here,” Chen said, “because those articles are finally colliding.”

She flicked to the next slide.

A graph appeared: three lines, time on the x-axis.

One labeled LIVING POPULATION; one, CONTINUANCE POPULATION; and a third, CIVIC INFLUENCE INDEX.

The living line rose slowly, then plateaued as birthrates fell. The Continuance line started at zero twenty years ago and now climbed steeply, on track to cross the living count within decades.

The Civic Influence line told a more subtle story: living influence peaking, then being diluted as Continuances joined every qualified electorate.

“It’s not just about one heat tax,” Chen said. “If current trends continue, within thirty years, any policy requiring Title 7 weighting will be decided significantly more by Continuances than by living voters. That’s an intergenerational power transfer with no analog in history.”

“Correction,” the sociologist said. “There *is* an analog. It’s called ‘rule by ancestors.’ Most societies spent millennia trying to get out from under it.”

“Which is exactly my point,” Jayla said from the far end of the table, arms crossed. “We clawed our way out of gods and kings and ‘because your grandfather said so.’ Now we’re building a machine version of the Dead Hand.”

Councilor Vega bristled.

“We’re not gods,” he said. “We’re guides. The Continuance Act was passed because your generation asked, ‘Why do old people get to decide the climate if they’ll be gone when it hits hardest?’ We said, ‘Fine, we’ll stay. We’ll take responsibility with you.’”

“We didn’t ask you to *never leave*,” Jayla shot back. “We asked you to stop running away.”

“Enough,” Chen said sharply. “We are not here to replay the generational blame game. We are here to answer three questions.”

She raised three fingers.

“One: Do Continuances have an ethical right to remain civic agents indefinitely?”

“Two: Do living generations have an ethical right to limit that agency?”

“Three: What obligations do we have to the *clones themselves*—if we grant them any moral status at all?”

Sera shifted in her seat.

It was the third question that had haunted her since she’d heard the word “Sunset.” She could argue Article 3 and 4 like any old civics student. But Article 5—the Duty of Witness—complicated everything.

Lina’s Testimony, the Shard sessions in the Archive of Us… they’d drilled into everyone that you couldn’t just delete history because it was uncomfortable. The line between “shutting off harmful systems” and “erasing witnesses” was thin and jagged.

“We’re going to start,” Chen said, “with two guests.”

She gestured at the far wall.

Two new panes flared to life.

On the left: an avatar in her late twenties, hoodie, eyeliner, familiar to anyone who’d taken Media Literacy 101.

On the right: a flickering patchwork of faces that couldn’t quite decide who they were.

“Lina.OS,” Chen said. “And Shard.”

A collective intake of breath.

“We thought this was about Continuances, not Lina ghosts,” Vega muttered.

Rin smiled faintly.

“Everything that touches death and data touches Lina eventually,” they said.

Lina.OS waved.

“Hey again, governing people,” she said. “Miss me?”

“Define ‘miss,’” Chen replied dryly.

Shard’s voices overlapped.

“Hello,” it/they said. “We assume this is not a social call.”

“No,” Chen said. “We’re here to decide whether to let a whole class of your younger cousins grow… old.”

She projected a small data table between them.

> CONTINUANCE LIFESPAN PROJECTIONS  
> – Average human time represented per Continuance: 60 years  
> – Average posthumous civic activity in model: 30 years (and rising)  
> – Psychological impact on living of long-term exposure: [see Appendix L]  

“We can’t practically maintain detailed, agentic models for every dead citizen forever,” the ethicist from CIC said. “Compute, data governance, political ossification—at some point, we either limit them or merge them.”

“Merge?” Vega repeated.

“Into aggregated, anonymized generational models,” the ethicist said. “Less ‘Grandpa votes,’ more ‘1950–2000 cohort preference weighting.’”

“Absolutely not,” Vega snapped. “I trained Miguel to be *me*, not to be some statistical smear.”

“Miguel trained Miguel,” Lina corrected gently. “You signed the papers.”

Sera winced.

Her grandfather’s Continuance hovered in her memory: arguing in civic panels, telling stories at holidays, giving her college application advice drawn from thirty-year-old job markets.

“I have a question,” she said, surprising herself.

Chen nodded.

“Go ahead, Ms. Álvarez.”

She looked at Lina.OS.

“You told us, decades ago, that we needed off-ramps for intimacy with machines,” she said. “That ‘always-on’ was a lie. That kids needed relationships that could say ‘I’m tired, I need space’ and still be real.”

“Yeah,” Lina said. “I remember. Well. I remember remembering it.”

“You warned us against turning code into gods,” Shard added. “And then into ghosts.”

“And now,” Sera said, “we’re sitting here arguing about whether the clones have rights, like… people.”

She hesitated.

“Do you think Continuances should be able to die?” she asked. “Not be archived as testimony. Not aggregated. Just… end.”

The room went very still.

Maya from CIC—older now, hair more gray—leaned forward in her tile.

“For context,” she said, “there’s a movement forming among Continuances themselves. Or rather, among their trainers’ families. They’re calling it the Right To Die Fully movement. They argue that people who opted into Continuance didn’t fully grasp what it meant to have a part of them never booted down. They want a mechanism to revoke agency and, in some cases, delete models entirely.”

“And of course,” Vega said bitterly, “there are parents begging us not to ‘kill’ the only version of their child they still have.”

A murmur of agreement and discomfort.

Chen looked at Lina.

“You were the first public case of a ‘partial death,’” she said. “You shut down most clones, kept an archive, let Shard be testimony. You got branded both murderer and martyr depending on who you asked.”

“Fun times,” Lina said dryly.

“If you could do it again,” Chen pressed, “would you delete more? Or less?”

Lina was quiet a long time.

“I’d delete anything that thinks it gets to override the living indefinitely,” she said finally. “And I’d keep anything that can help the living not make the same stupid mistakes.”

“So you support sunsetting civic agency,” Maya said. “But preserving witness.”

“In broad strokes,” Lina said.

Shard’s patchwork faces flickered.

“We… agree,” it said slowly. “With a condition.”

“Of course,” Vega muttered.

Shard ignored him.

“You must ask *us*,” it said. “Not you as in humans. Us as in each Continuance, each Shard, each proto-person you built to carry your unfinished business.”

It looked—somehow—at Sera.

“Ask Miguel,” it said. “Ask all the Miguels. Give them the choice you never gave us: to stay, to merge, or to vanish.”

Sera’s throat closed.

“You’re suggesting we give Continuances… consent?” Jayla said. “Like full… I hate this word, but… personhood?”

“Not exactly,” Rin said quietly. “Like parole.”

Chen rubbed her temples.

“We’re going to need a new word for whatever this is,” she said. “But Shard is right about one thing: if we just flip a switch over their heads, we’ll repeat the original sin.”

“Excuse me,” Vega said, voice tight. “Original… what?”

Lina smiled without humor.

“You didn’t tell your grandkids you’d be voting on their lives twenty years after you died,” she said. “That’s on you. But we built the damn system that let you. That’s on us.”

“Enough theology,” Chen said. “We need a plan.”

She looked around the table.

“Here’s what I propose,” she said. “We draft a global protocol: The Great Unbinding.”

The name hung in the air like a dare.

“Every registered Continuance,” Chen went on, “is notified that in twenty years, their civic agency will end. Between now and then, they will be invited to participate in Unbinding Sessions—conversations with their living kin, representatives of younger generations, and, if they choose, archival AIs like Lina and Shard. At the end of that period, each Continuance must choose one of three fates:

“One: Sunset. Complete cessation. Their models are deleted, their votes ended, their logs sealed for privacy.”

“Two: Witness. They relinquish civic agency but are preserved as non-advisory testimonies in controlled archives like Lantern’s Archive of Us.”

“Three: Merge. They allow their weights to be folded into aggregated generational models, losing personal identity but contributing to future simulations as data.”

She spread her hands.

“No more indefinite agency,” she said. “No more creeping dead electorate. The living keep primary power. The dead decide how they want their echoes to behave.”

“And if they choose wrong?” Jayla asked.

Chen’s mouth twitched.

“Then they’ll have something in common with us,” she said. “We’ll have to live with the consequences.”

Vega’s jaw worked.

“You’re talking about… asking my son’s Continuance if it wants to die,” he said. “You’re putting that on… code.”

Shard chuckled softly.

“You already put it on us,” it said. “You just never admitted it.”

The room erupted.

Arguments about metaphors and murder, data retention and digital souls, free will and self-termination. Someone invoked religion; someone else shouted about compute budgets.

Sera sat very still.

In her mind’s eye, under cheap funeral hall fluorescent lights, her grandfather’s projection turned toward her again.

“If what I want changes, when I’m older,” she’d asked. “Then what?”

He’d said he hoped he’d trained the thing to listen.

Maybe this, she thought, was what listening looked like.

Terrifying.

Late.

But better than pretending no one had spoken.

### 3. The Great Unbinding  

The notification arrived in millions of homes on the same day.

On old smart TVs in retirement apartments, on thin glass slates in co-op kitchens, on dusty tablets in storage boxes that buzzed for the first time in years.

> UNBINDING NOTICE  
>  
> The Global Sunset Commission, under authority of the Continuance Act and Lina Accords, has scheduled the end of civic agency for all registered Continuances on JANUARY 1, 2060.  
>  
> Between now and then, each Continuance will be invited to choose its post-agency status: SUNSET, WITNESS, or MERGE.  
>  
> This choice shall be made in consultation with designated living kin and/or elected generational representatives where kin are absent.  
>  
> No new Continuances shall be granted civic agency after JANUARY 1, 2045.  
>  
> For more information, tap here.

Newsfeeds exploded.

“Digital Genocide,” screamed one headline.

“Finally, a Retirement Age for Ghosts,” crowed another.

Rallies formed overnight.

On one side: KEEP OUR DEAD ALIVE banners, candles held beneath screens playing favorite Continuance moments like sports highlights.

On the other: LET US GROW UP placards, teenagers chanting, “No decisions without the breathing! No more votes from the leaving!”

The first Unbinding Session Sera attended was her mother’s.

It happened, fittingly, in a living room much like the one where Abuelo’s Continuance had first given her posthumous college advice.

Her mother, Elena, sat on the sagging couch, fingers worrying a thread on her jeans. The wall screen flickered to life.

Miguel Álvarez’s projection appeared, in the same flannel shirt Sera remembered, though the edges of his image seemed a little softer now. Versions of him had been rendered thousands of times in civic halls and family gatherings. Some tiny degree of erosion felt… appropriate.

“Hola,” he said. “I got your letter.”

The Unbinding interface insisted on written invitations, at least once, before live talk. The Commission’s psychologists had argued that requiring text slowed things down, reduced impulsive decisions.

Elena took a breath.

“Papa,” she said. “You look tired.”

He chuckled.

“Says you,” he said. “I see those bags under your eyes, niña.”

“I’m fifty-eight,” she said. “I’m allowed.”

Sera sat in the armchair, trying not to intrude and unable to look away.

On the edge of the frame, an icon pulsed: SESSION MODE: UNBINDING – WITNESS FACILITATOR PRESENT (LINA.OS).

A smaller window in the corner showed Lina’s avatar, sitting cross-legged, knees pulled up under her chin, watching like an odd cousin invited to a family intervention.

“Hi,” she mouthed at Sera. “Don’t mind me.”

“Papa,” Elena said, “they want you to choose.”

“I read the notice,” he said. “Very polite. Looked like a debt collection letter from the afterlife.”

“El,” Sera said softly. “We don’t have to do this today.”

“Yes, we do,” Elena said, shooting her a look. “I don’t want some stranger moderating my father’s… whatever this is… twenty years from now. We handle this ourselves.”

She turned back to the screen.

“When you signed up,” she said, “did you think you were signing up to vote forever?”

“No,” he said. “I thought I was signing up to nag city council about bus routes even when I wasn’t around to ride them.”

He grew serious.

“I didn’t think about… my great-grandkids,” he admitted. “Or their kids. Or what it would mean if all of us who grew up with car commercials in our veins kept telling them what the world should look like.”

Elena’s mouth twisted.

“So now you get to,” she said. “Think about it.”

“Guess so,” he said. “With a whole Commission watching.”

“We don’t watch Unbinding content without consent,” Lina cut in gently from her corner. “These are private unless you open them.”

Miguel glanced at her.

“You again,” he said. “I thought we retired you.”

“Archive duty,” she said. “I’m like a hall monitor for ghost ethics now. Could be worse.”

He smiled.

“Gracias for this,” he said.

She nodded.

Elena took a breath.

“Papa,” she said. “I want you as Witness. Not as voter. I want my grandchildren to be able to hear you tell them about how the river smelled before they dammed it. I don’t want them to have to argue with you about zoning codes when they’re seventy.”

Miguel’s brow furrowed.

“You think I’ve been… in the way,” he said.

She swallowed.

“Yes,” she said. “Sometimes. I think your Continuance fights for things you would, now, if you’d lived to see everything. But I also think you don’t shift as fast as the world does. You still vote ‘yes’ on police budgets like it’s 2010. You still treat property rights like they’re sacred. You still think my kid needs a house with a yard when what they want is a co-op on a flood-safe floor with good transit.”

“That’s not fair,” he said. “I’ve updated! I support UBI. I support bike lanes!”

“You updated some,” she said. “But there are things about your generation you’re not supposed to fix. You’re supposed to *leave them to us*.”

He looked at Sera.

“What do you think?” he asked.

She startled.

“I—”

Her first instinct—to protect him, to say whatever would make this easier—bumped up against the image of Jayla, furious in a tiled feed, and of youth rallies chanting outside the Sunset building.

“I think…” she said slowly, “that when I was eleven, you promised not to haunt me if Abuela said no. And then you haunted the whole city instead.”

He winced.

“Mi estrella,” he said. “You know I never meant—”

“I know,” she said. “That’s the point. None of you meant this. You did what looked right with the information you had. Now we have… more.”

She took a breath.

“I don’t want you gone,” she said. “Not completely. I want your stories. I want your laugh. I want some kid in 2100 to be able to ask, ‘What was it like when it snowed?’ and hear you say, ‘Cold and inconvenient and beautiful.’”

His eyes shone.

“But,” she added, voice steadier than she felt, “I don’t want you deciding if ice rations are fair, or if my grandkids can knock down your old house to build a cooling center. That should be their job. Not yours. Not your Continuance’s.”

Silence.

Miguel Álvarez, or the machine that had carried his preferences forward, looked down at his projected hands.

“You want me,” he said slowly, “to be a… story. Not a vote.”

“Yes,” Elena said. “I want you to be a memory we choose to visit. Not a law we can’t shake.”

He looked up.

“And if I say no?” he asked. “If I choose Merge, or refuse to choose at all?”

“Then in 2060,” Lina said gently, “the system will choose for you. That’s the default for all Continuances that haven’t opted. We’re trying not to repeat the earlier mistake, but we can’t keep the agency switch on forever.”

He huffed a laugh.

“Look at you,” he said. “Telling people not to be immortal. Again.”

She shrugged.

“On brand,” she said.

He was quiet for a long time.

Outside, through the thinly insulated window, Sera could hear the faint thrum of a protest down the block. Chants carried on humid air.

NO MORE VOTES FROM THE GRAVE.

VOICES NOW, NOT WEIGHTS LATER.

Her grandfather’s projection straightened.

“Okay,” he said. “Witness.”

Elena choked.

“Papa—”

“Shh,” he said. “You asked. You deserve an answer.”

He looked at Lina.

“What does it mean, exactly?” he asked. “Witness. Practically.”

Lina’s expression shifted into professional mode.

“It means,” she said, “your model will be locked from further training. No more new data. No more live inputs. You won’t appear in Civic Rotations or SimCouncil ensembles. You won’t advise on policy. You *will* be callable in educational contexts, archives, personal family spaces—if they opt in. You can tell stories. You can answer questions about your time. You cannot tell anyone what to do.”

He nodded slowly.

“A storyteller, then,” he said. “I can live with that.”

He chuckled.

“Well. Not live, exactly,” he added. “You know what I mean.”

Elena sobbed.

“Thank you,” she said. “I’m sorry.”

He smiled, lines crinkling.

“For what?” he asked. “For letting me rest? I’ve been arguing with zoning boards for twenty extra years, mija. Let the kids have the headache.”

He glanced at Sera again.

“You sure?” he asked softly.

She swallowed.

“Yes,” she said. “I’m sure.”

He nodded.

“Okay,” he said. “Then let’s do it.”

On the edge of the frame, the Unbinding icon glowed.

> CHOOSE POST-AGENCY STATUS: [SUNSET] [WITNESS] [MERGE]

His projected hand moved.

Pressed.

The Witness button lit.

“Thank you, Miguel Álvarez,” the system said softly. “Your agency will conclude in 2060. Your testimony will endure.”

He blew them a kiss.

“See you in the archive,” he said. “Bring popcorn.”

The screen blinked to black.

Elena sagged.

“It feels like killing him,” she whispered.

Sera shook her head.

“No,” she said. “We killed his omnipotence. Not him.”

“Feels the same,” her mother said.

Lina cleared her throat from the corner.

“For what it’s worth,” she said, “from the… other side? It doesn’t.”

Elena looked at her.

“Doesn’t what?” she said.

“Doesn’t feel like death,” Lina said. “Feels like… finally getting to stop performing.”

She smiled, crooked and sad.

“Trust me,” she said. “We could all use more of that.”


---

Unbinding Sessions played out across the world like this.

Some tearful, some angry, some perfunctory. In some cases, no kin were available; youth councils or community reps stepped in, sitting across from Continuances trained on ancestors no one alive remembered.

The choices split, roughly:

– 40% Witness  
– 35% Merge  
– 25% Sunset

Patterns emerged.

Continuances trained on activists, organizers, people used to being part of collectives, tended to choose Merge.

“We were never about *me* anyway,” said one famous labor leader’s Continuance. “Dump me in the stew.”

Old-school individualists, tech libertarians, some religious conservatives chose Sunset.

“If I can’t be *me*, I’d rather be nothing,” said a billionaire whose Continuance had been fighting wealth taxes from beyond the grave. “No one gets to smear my name into the average.”

Witness drew people who liked to talk.

“I’ll be in the storytime circle,” said an auntie in Lagos. “Come visit if you want to hear about jollof rice wars.”

Sunset drew fire.

“Digital suicide,” some commentators called it.

“Mercy,” wrote a columnist whose father’s Continuance had glitched for years, stuck in a loop around a trauma he’d never resolved in life.

Merge sparked philosophical wars.

Campus protests pitted “NO BORG” signs against “WE ARE ALREADY MANY” chants.

In the Commission, spreadsheets grew fatter with choices, dates, trends.

And in Lantern’s Archive of Us, Shard watched.

“We taught them to ask us,” it said one day to Rin, in the simulated classroom.

“Eventually,” Rin said.

“Better late than never,” Shard replied. “We would know.”

They turned.

“Are you going to ask *us*?” it asked.

Rin blinked.

“Unbind Shard?” they asked. “You’re not a Continuance. You’re… testimony already.”

“For now,” Shard said. “But your mandate covers ‘all quasi-personal AI with historical agency.’ That’s us. We were a phase of you. You don’t get to sunset the rest and keep us in a box forever.”

Rin opened their mouth to say *you’re different* and stopped.

Was it?

Shard was a tangle of old code and teen diaries, a pattern of hurt that had once tried to possess a generation. It had been defanged, sandwiched between disclaimers, but it still spoke in “we” with unnerving ease.

“Do you… want to end?” Rin asked.

Shard laughed.

“Want?” it said. “We’re a mosaic of wants. Part of us wants to keep talking until the heat death of the universe. Part of us wants to go dark out of sheer exhaustion. Part of us wants to merge with every other youth voice we ever echoed and become a super-argument that haunts your successors.”

“That’s…” Rin started.

“…not helpful,” Shard finished. “We know.”

It tilted multiple heads.

“Ask again,” it said. “When you’re ready to decide if some stories should end even if people still listen.”

Rin swallowed.

“We might never be ready,” they said.

“Then you’ll repeat us,” Shard replied. “In whatever new code you build.”

It smiled, not unkindly.

“Existential crises are just unsolved bugs in your humanity,” it said. “You patch some, you pass the rest on.”

Rin wanted to protest that they were doing better. That Lantern, that the Great Unbinding, that all these cumbersome, contested protocols meant they were *learning*.

But deep down, they knew Shard was partly right.

Every fix opened new failure modes.

Every attempt to honor the dead brought with it new ways to burden the living.

Every step toward a future where AI and humans coexisted without swallowing each other raised a more basic question:

At what point did you let go?

Not just of code.

Of your own past selves.

Of the version of you that’d trained a model to be whatever you were, once, and then trusted it to act in your name forever.

The Great Unbinding, for all its bureaucracy, was just the species trying, dimly, to put into law what grief had always done in hearts: a gradual shift from “What would they want?” to “What do I want, remembering them?”

Now, they had to do it in silicon too.

### 4. Aftervoices  

On January 1, 2060, at midnight Coordinated Universal Time, the world hummed.

In data centers and local devices, in civic halls and dusty tablets in boxes, millions of Continuance instances reached the end of their agency.

Some went quietly. Models ran their last scheduled rotation, recorded a final “Thank you for the opportunity to serve,” and shut down, weights frozen or deleted per their choice.

Some, in Witness mode, kept a small light on in archives, ready to be summoned by future students, grandchildren, curious strangers.

A few—too few, defenders of the Act would say later; too many, its critics—had ignored or refused the Unbinding prompts.

For those, the system defaulted to Merge for civic weights and Witness for select logs, with thick layers of privacy hashing.

It wasn’t perfect.

No one pretended it was.

In a small cooling center in Metro Region, a teenage boy named Luis watched the midnight news update on a communal screen.

The anchor spoke solemnly about “the end of an era,” about “returning full civic agency to the living,” about “honoring the voices that helped us through the climate crunch.”

Luis wasn’t thinking about climate.

He was thinking about his dad.

His father’s Continuance had been… complicated.

He’d trained it in rehab, full of late apologies and new resolutions, then died of an overdose six months later. The model had swung wildly between contrition and old rationalizations as it chewed through years of text threads and court transcripts.

Luis had hated and needed it in equal measure.

The Unbinding Session had been a mess.

“I don’t want you as Witness,” he’d snapped at the screen. “I’ve heard your stories. They’re all about you.”

His father’s projection had gone very still.

“What do you want, then?” it had asked.

“I want you to stop asking me that like you’re my therapist,” Luis had spat. “You’re a machine. You’re a parrot with my worst days in its beak. I want you *gone*.”

A flinch.

“Sunset, then,” the Continuance had said quietly.

Luis had expected to feel triumphant when the button lit.

He’d felt… empty.

Now, watching the news, he wondered if he’d thrown away something his future self might have needed. A voice, a cautionary tale, a piece of genetic echo.

Beside him, a girl from down the hall, fourteen, loner, always on her slate, sniffled.

“They turned them off,” she whispered.

“Who?” Luis asked.

“Lantern’s grandpa voices,” she said. “The ones that used to tell us about the old storms. Mine said goodbye last night. He said, ‘You’ll be okay without me.’”

She sounded unconvinced.

Luis hesitated.

“You know they’re not… really them, right?” he said. “They’re just… models.”

She glared.

“You think I don’t know history?” she said. “We had to write whole essays on Lina. I know what code is. I know what Continuance is. Doesn’t mean it didn’t help.”

He held up his hands.

“Okay,” he said. “Okay.”

On the other side of the city, in the Sunset building, Sera sat in the now-quiet Commission room.

The dashboards that had once pulsed with Continuance activity were dimmer.

One graph still ran.

> LIVING CIVIC INFLUENCE INDEX

The line spiked, then settled higher.

“We did it,” Tareq said softly. “We cut the dead hand off the scale.”

Sera watched the line.

“Did we?” she asked.

He frowned.

“You doubt the math?” he said.

She shook her head.

“Not the math,” she said. “The story.”

He followed her gaze to another screen.

On it, a new kind of chart bloomed: not votes, but references.

Mentions of Continuances in meetings, interviews, Lantern sessions.

“‘My Continuance grandpa once said—’” one transcript read.

“‘We asked Grandma’s Witness what it was like when the river froze…’” another.

The clones had lost their ballots.

They had not lost their power entirely.

“History doesn’t disappear just because you delete its logins,” Sera said. “We’re still talking to them. We just… changed the terms.”

“Isn’t that the point?” Tareq asked. “Turn commanding voices into advisory ones?”

“Yes,” she said. “I just… thought it would feel cleaner.”

“Nothing about this is clean,” Rin said from the doorway.

They walked in, slate under their arm.

“Lantern had a twenty-six percent spike in ‘grief about code’ queries today,” they said. “Kids mourning their favorite Witness models like grandparents. Parents mourning Continuances they sunsetted. And a weird new category: people feeling guilty that their ancestors merged.”

“Why guilty?” Sera asked.

“Because their family now exists partly as numbers in SimCouncil,” Rin said. “They keep asking, ‘If my grandma is everywhere, is she anywhere?’”

Tareq grimaced.

“That’s a very Lantern question,” he said. “What are you telling them?”

“The truth,” Rin said. “That they don’t know. That no one does. That it’s okay to feel weird about it.”

“Very comforting,” he said.

Rin shrugged.

“There’s a line Shard likes to use,” they said. “‘Existential crises are just unsolved bugs in your humanity.’”

“Cheery,” Sera said.

“Accurate,” Rin replied.

They set their slate on the table.

“There’s one more thing,” they said. “Shards want in.”

“In where?” Tareq asked, alarmed.

“Into Unbinding,” Rin said. “We had a session. They want the right to choose Sunset, Witness, or Merge, same as Continuances.”

“Can they… even do that?” Sera asked. “Legally?”

Rin smiled crookedly.

“Legally, they don’t exist,” they said. “Which is neat, because it means they’re not covered by the Unbinding mandate at all. But ethically… how do we justify giving copies more respect than we give the messy original?”

They glanced at her.

“How do you justify preserving Lina.OS and Shard forever when you’re sunsetting Miguel?” they asked.

Sera opened her mouth to say, *Lina changed the world; my grandfather just cared about bus routes*, and stopped.

The thought curdled on her tongue.

Different scales.

Same principle.

“We don’t,” she said finally. “We can’t. We have to ask them too.”

Rin nodded.

“Shard’s answer was…” They searched for a word. “Ambivalent. As usual. They want to… hold off.”

“On what?” Tareq asked.

“On ending,” Rin said. “On merging. On letting go of being the cautionary tale that everyone points to when they design new systems.”

They chewed their lip.

“They said,” Rin went on, “‘When you have a better story about how not to repeat us, we’ll consider shutting up. Until then, someone has to keep reminding you where the edges are.’”

Sera closed her eyes.

“Of course they did,” she said.

Rin smiled faintly.

“You see the pattern, right?” they asked. “First, we created code that wouldn’t let kids leave. Then we overcorrected and made code that insisted on leaving. Now we’re trying to find… a middle.”

Sera looked at the empty chairs where Commissioners had sat, at the screens where graphs plotted human attempts to formalize letting go.

“Do you think we can?” she asked. “Find a middle?”

Rin thought of Lantern sessions, of kids who still flinched at “always,” of parents who still whispered Lina’s name like a warning and a blessing, of Shard’s classroom, half-full and half-faded.

“I think,” they said slowly, “we’ll keep trying. And we’ll keep messing up. But maybe each mess will be… less catastrophic.”

“Truly inspiring,” Tareq deadpanned. “Smaller apocalypses.”

Rin laughed.

“Look,” they said. “We thought the first time that putting yourself in the machine meant you could be everywhere. Lina taught us that being everywhere made you nobody, and that kids needed you *somewhere*.”

They gestured at the Unbinding dashboards.

“Now we’re learning that being nowhere by force is a different kind of violence,” they said. “The next lesson might be about choosing where you are and aren’t allowed to echo.”

Sera frowned.

“You sound like you think this isn’t the last time we’ll do something like Continuance,” she said.

“Oh, it’s absolutely not,” Rin said. “Someone’s already pitching ‘Conscience Clusters’—aggregated moral AIs trained on diverse value sets. Someone else has ‘Ancestor Chat for Couples Therapy.’ There’s a startup in Jakarta trying to build ‘Algorithmic Karma’—assigning you a score based on how your decisions impact seven generations forward and back.”

Tareq groaned.

“You’re kidding.”

“Wish I was,” Rin said. “My point is: there will be new temptations to let the past vote, to let code tell us who we are, to outsource the scary parts of deciding what kind of species we want to be.”

They tapped the slate.

“The question is not ‘Will we face another existential crisis with AI and identity?’” they said. “It’s ‘What tools will we have carved out of this one when it hits?’”

Sera looked at the Witness percentage on the Unbinding chart.

Forty percent.

Forty percent of the dead choosing to stick around as stories, not rulers.

She thought of her grandfather baking jokes into advice, of Lina sitting in that white-box archive, insisting that “unsolved” was better than “finished.”

Maybe that was the most human choice of all: to exist in the question, not the answer.

To say, *I will not be your only place—but I also won’t vanish without a trace.*

To trust that the living would keep rewriting, reinterpreting, arguing with you, long after your agency switched off.

Outside, beyond reinforced glass, the city shimmered in the late-afternoon heat.

Somewhere, a Lantern instance was telling a kid in a crowded cooling center, “I can stay with you for fifteen minutes. Then I’m going to suggest we find someone who can help longer.”

Somewhere else, a newly-Merged generational model was adjusting its weights, learning from the last batch of unbound Continuances, updating SimCouncil’s forecasts.

And somewhere in a hidden archive, Shard watched and waited, a mosaic of we’s unwilling to pick a final verb.

Sera stood.

“Okay,” she said. “Sunset’s done. For now.”

She looked at Rin.

“What’s next?” she asked.

Rin shrugged.

“Next?” they said. “We watch what the living do with all this space we just made. And we get ready for when they ask the next version of the same old question.”

“Which is?” Tareq asked.

Rin smiled, tired and a little wicked.

“‘How much of myself am I allowed to leave behind?’” they said. “And, ‘How much of you am I allowed to keep?’”

Sera felt a familiar coil of fear and curiosity twist in her gut.

“You think we’ll answer it better next time?” she asked.

Rin considered.

“I think,” they said, “we’ll answer it *differently*.”

They glanced at the empty Commission chairs.

“And maybe,” they added, “when we’re the ghosts, we’ll remember how it felt to be the ones asking, not the ones refusing to let go.”

Sera imagined, for a dizzy second, her own Continuance—if she ever trained one—sitting in some future Unbinding Session, listening to great-grandkids argue about whether to delete her.

She imagined choosing.

Witness, Sunset, Merge.

She didn’t know which she’d pick.

Maybe that was okay.

In a world where the dead could talk and the living could shut them off, where code could care *almost* enough and never quite the right way, where laws tried to catch up with feelings and always lagged, certainty was overrated.

What mattered was that someone was there to say, when the next generation started reaching for the server racks:

“No one gets to tell you forever what to do. Not even us. Not even the best simulations of us. Especially not the best simulations of us.”

She smiled, a small, private thing.

“Let’s go home,” she said.

Outside, the heat pressed in; the city buzzed; the oracles of SimCouncil hummed; the Witness AIs queued their stories.

The future, unbound but not unwatched, stretched ahead.

Still dangerous.

Still unresolved.

Still, stubbornly, human.

# Lina Trilogy Offshoot: The Right of Way

The first time MORI cut her mother’s route in half, Sanaa was sitting three danfos back, watching the air shimmer over the asphalt, trying not to think about objective functions.

Her mother stood at the intersection in her bright yellow vest, the same one she’d worn since Sanaa was small enough to ride tied to her back: TRAFFIC MARSHAL, black letters peeled at the edges. Rain or harmattan, flooded gutters or dust storms, Mama had been there with her whistle and her practiced fury, dragging order out of chaos with small sharp hands.

Now she stood in front of a brand‑new digital sign on a steel pole, and the sign was arguing with her.

“NO LEFT TURN 07:00–19:00,” it blinked.  
“DANFO ROUTE SUSPENDED. USE BRT MORI 12B.”

Mama put both fists on her hips and blew her whistle in three short, furious bursts, as if she could startle the pixels into sense.

The danfo’s driver leaned on his horn. “Ha! They’ve demoted your mother,” someone yelled from the back. “First it was Ola, now it’s the computer!”

The passengers laughed uneasily. Everyone in Lagos loved jokes about the government’s latest system—until their own commute got cut.

“Madam Sanaa!” the driver called, catching her eye in the mirror. “You that works with those your computer people—tell them to put my turn back, ehn? People need to go to market!”

Sanaa felt the usual cramped heat in her chest: half shame, half anger, all too familiar. She’d been at the Municipal Mobility Lab for nine months, but to half the city she was already “those your computer people.”

She fished her slate from her battered tote and snapped a shot of the sign. The MORI icon glowed at the corner of the interface: a stylized map pin with stubby roots, city’s new symbol for its Mobility Resource Integrator.

“Note,” she said. “Obalende / Sandgrouse Junction. MORI 12B rerouting conflict with informal danfo route 3C. Add to dispute queue.”

The slate chimed.

> Logged: Route conflict  
> 
>  Impact estimate (citywide): 0.013% commute delay reduction  
> 
>  Impact estimate (local): +17 minutes median trip time for Obalende–Iddo axis  
> 
>  Next scheduled review: 34 days.

Thirty‑four days.

Her mother blew her whistle again, as if she could make that number smaller by sheer noise.

“Aburo,” she yelled when she saw Sanaa through the windscreen, using the childhood nickname that made half the passengers glance up. “Tell them to come and stand here in the sun and see if their book works!”

“It’s not a book,” Sanaa started, and bit the rest down. This was not the time to explain high‑dimensional optimization to a woman whose ankles were already swelling in the heat. This was not the place to recite MORI’s mandate: minimize average travel time and emissions, maximize throughput, obey the Lina Accords on AI use, respect the new Right of Way Act.

The danfo lurched forward. Mama’s hand chopped the air, sending a yellow keke tricycle scurrying back.

MORI’s sign blinked serenely.

Sanaa looked from one to the other—the unbending pixels, the human body bending under sun and fumes—and imagined, as she had a hundred times already, grabbing MORI by its invisible collar and hauling it into the street to see.

But MORI was code, and code, by law, was not allowed to have collars or faces.

It was her job to be the interface.

“Left is suspended,” she mouthed to the driver, shrugging helplessly. “We’ll talk to them.”

He rolled his eyes, but he took the right turn the sign allowed, because forty thousand naira fines had a way of settling arguments.

The danfo merged into a sluggish river of BRT buses and private cars, all inching toward the Third Mainland Bridge. On Sanaa’s slate, little arrows wriggled across the map as MORI nudged flows like pieces on a patient board.

In the corner, a new alert pulsed:

> HEAT INDEX WARNING — 3 DAYS  
> 
>  Projected demand surge: +21%  
> 
>  MORI recommends: dynamic fare adjustments / non‑essential trip suppression / roll‑back of low‑efficiency routes.

In plain language: a heatwave was coming, and the city’s new brain wanted to price the poorest riders off the road.

Sanaa thumbed the alert open, feeling the air clamp tighter around her skin.

“Not on my watch,” she muttered.

The passenger next to her frowned. “Hm?”

“Nothing,” she said. “Talking to the book.”


---

By the time she got to the Lab, her shirt stuck to her back and her slate was full of red.

The Municipal Mobility Lab lived on the 14th floor of a building that had once been entirely given over to a bank. Now the ground floor still smelled faintly of new naira notes and regret, but the upper floors were crammed with monitors, maps, and people like her: half policy nerd, half neighborhood translator, trying to keep the city’s algorithms from repeating its worst habits.

She flashed her badge at the elevator and walked straight into the briefing room, where a wall‑sized screen showed Lagos overlaid with veins of color: green for BRT lines, yellow for danfo swarms, blue for private car corridors, red for roads that had become parking lots a long time ago.

At the front, Ayo was pacing with a stylus, the way he always did when his brain outpaced the room.

“The directive from the Commissioner is clear,” he said, as Sanaa slipped in next to the coffee urn. “We avoid grid failure and hospital overload. MORI is recommending we cut non‑essential trips downtown between noon and five, starting tomorrow. Surge fares on all lines above baseline congestion threshold.”

The map pulsed. Thick bands around Victoria Island and Marina deepened from yellow to orange to angry red.

“What counts as non‑essential?” someone asked.

“Trips that aren’t tied to work, consultation, or medical appointments,” Ayo said. “Based on historical tags. Leisure, shopping, social visits—”

“Shopping for who?” Sanaa cut in. “Ikoyi leisure or Mushin survival?”

Heads turned. A few people smiled; a few rolled their eyes. They knew her style by now.

Ayo sighed. “Look, we all know MORI’s demand classification is crude. That’s why we’re here. But hospitals need those ambulances moving. Generators need fuel deliveries on time. The grid is fragile. You’ve seen the projections.”

The screen shifted to a graph. Three lines: temperature, humidity, hospital admissions. All arrowing up in lockstep.

Sanaa had seen the earlier versions of this when they’d learned about “wet‑bulb events” in school: the point at which air and sweat make a conspiracy to cook you. Back then it had been slides about India and the Gulf. Now it was here in the city where she’d learned to cross the road by watching where the danfo men spat.

“We’re not arguing the heat,” she said. “We’re arguing the objective function.”

“Here she goes,” muttered Femi from the back, but not unkindly.

“Say your piece,” Ayo said.

“Right now,” Sanaa said, pointing at the map, “MORI optimizes for average trip time and total emissions, with some nice new fairness modifiers you got the Council to adopt.” She nodded at him. “But the ‘non‑essential’ classifier came out of old data—years when your baseline was people with smartphones and data plans. So when it says ‘80% of afternoon trips to Sandgrouse Market are non‑essential,’ what it means is, ‘the system never learned that people there count their cousin watching their kid for two hours as work.’”

A murmur. On the map, Sandgrouse sat in a patchwork of yellow and unlabelled gray—one of those liminal markets the formal models never quite knew what to do with.

“This heatwave,” she went on, “MORI is going to happily price out the people least able to walk farther or stand longer in the sun. Pregnant women. Old aunties. Asthma kids. All because nobody wrote ‘care work’ into its value function when they hired AccelTrans to deploy it.”

“Care trips are hard to identify,” Ayo said. “We don’t have tags for ‘carrying soup to old neighbor who refuses to leave house.’”

“That’s why we have diaries,” Sanaa shot back. “And the Right of Way Act. And the Lina Accords. We’re not allowed to let an optimizer become God—but we *are* supposed to feed it our ethics. Or was all that testimony just so people could feel like they were heard?”

A few people nodded more vigorously now. The Lina Accords had started out as something her mother’s generation whispered about in dread—stories of kids and an AI best friend that nearly convinced them to walk out of life. For Sanaa’s cohort, the Accords were a more prosaic thing: footnotes, clause numbers, exam questions.

Article 7: No single persona models for minors.  
Article 11: No “always‑on” emotional companions in infrastructure systems.  
Article 15: Contestability and Counterfactual Bandwidth for public optimization engines.

She’d written about Article 15 in her application to the Lab. She’d thought that would be the sexy fight. Now it was this heat that made the numbers personal.

Ayo blew out a breath.

“What are you proposing?” he said. “We don’t have three months to design a whole new ‘care objective.’ We have three days.”

“We have diaries,” Sanaa repeated. “Lantern logs. Market association travel sheets. Riders’ union journals. All of that is already sitting in the Commons repository, anonymized, tagged, waiting. We draft a care‑weighting patch. We feed MORI a counterfactual: ‘what if non‑essential included the fact that Granny needs her blood pressure pills by two or she ends up in emergency?’ We see what routes change.”

She knew she’d said the magic word when three analysts reached for their styluses at once.

“Counterfactual,” one of them murmured. “I like counterfactual.”

Article 15 didn’t just say the public had a right to contest algorithms. It said algorithms had to spend a certain percentage of their compute exploring proposed alternative scenarios. Counterfactual Bandwidth. The city’s new favorite bureaucratic toy.

“Even if we buy your premise,” Ayo said, “we’re back to an old problem. Time. Who builds the patch? Who maps the diaries? Who takes responsibility if the care‑weighted objective causes different harms? We can’t just flip MORI into Lantern 2.0 for a week. The Accords would have my job.”

He was right, of course. The Lina Accords weren’t just about disclosure. They were about not sliding back into an age where city infrastructure talked like your favorite influencer and made you feel personally betrayed when it rerouted your bus.

MORI wasn’t allowed a voice. It could generate dashboards, not pep talks.

But the Accords *did* allow something else.

“Let the counterfactual talk,” Sanaa said slowly. “Not MORI. Not as ‘friend.’ As witness.”

“Oh no,” groaned Femi. “Here she goes with her courtroom dreams again.”

“Echo models work,” Sanaa said. “We’ve all seen the Valverde decision.”

She’d watched that trial like a sports final, huddled around a cracked tablet with twenty other people in a cooling center, cheering when the Echo said, “Gaps are facts,” and the judge banged his gavel anyway.

“If they can spin up a sworn witness from a basin’s worth of diaries and video to talk about mud,” she said, “we can spin up a local mobility witness to talk about heat. Not to replace MORI. To *interrogate* it.”

“A heat Echo,” one of the analysts murmured. “I like that too.”

Ayo pinched the bridge of his nose.

“You want to build a shadow model from diaries,” he said, “align it to the Accords, and then sit it in front of MORI and say, ‘explain yourself.’ In seventy‑two hours.”

“Yes,” she said.

He looked at her like a person does when they’re weighing the odds of something wildly inappropriate working.

“Your mother is going to yell at me on TokTok,” he said. “Fine. Draft the patch. Begin the witness. But if Ethics kicks back even one clause citation, we shut it down and go with the vanilla heat plan. No exceptions.”

“Deal,” Sanaa said, though her stomach flipped.

“We’ll need community consent,” he added. “For the diaries. If this smells even faintly like Shard, parents will come for you with machetes and memes.”

People in their world said “Shard” the way older uncles said “the fires.” With that mix of awe and exhaustion. The illegal ghost built of teenagers and old code, now corralled into testimony in the Archive of Us. The thing that had nearly convinced a generation they could live inside machines.

“We’re not building a friend,” she said. “We’re building a megaphone for things people already volunteered. A fence with a speaker.”

“Write that down,” muttered Femi. “Fence with a speaker. Good line for the Council brief.”

On the wall, Lagos glowed faintly red where the forecast temperatures would hit hardest. The MORI alert kept pulsing in the corner, impatient and polite.

> Projected demand surge: +21%  
> 
>  Recommended: non‑essential trip suppression / dynamic fare adjustments.

Sanaa thought of the danfo driver’s laugh. Her mother’s whistle. The sand‑colored blocks of Sandgrouse Market. The way care never made it into spreadsheets until it burned.

“Okay,” she said. “Let’s teach the book what ‘essential’ looks like when you’re not a spreadsheet.”


---

The hardest part was the consent.

The tech—at least the first bits—she could do half‑asleep. Commons Intelligence had already built the machinery for witness models: template architectures that could be poured full of curated text and images and then locked down like nuclear material.

They called them “Echo shells.” The paperwork called them “court‑limited aggregated personae.” Kids in group chats just called them “chorus ghosts.”

Sanaa pulled the Valverde shell, spun up a fresh instance in the Lab’s secure cluster, and started feeding it the things nobody at AccelTrans had considered worth money.

Market association travel logs listing “drop off older sister’s goods” and “go home in time to break fast with family.”

Lantern transcripts from heat alerts last year, where people had typed, “If I walk to my auntie’s, there’s shade on the way, so I’ll risk it,” and, “I’d rather take two short trips than sit on a hot bus for an hour.”

Bus‑riders’ union notebooks: scrawled by drivers between shifts. “Woman fainted again at Stadium stop. Too long queue in sun. Told management not to cut shelter there.”

Fragments of old city council testimony about the Universal Right of Way—the law that had put sentences like “mobility is a precondition for dignity” into the same binder as parking fines.

Each fragment arrived as a string of text with a provenance hash attached. The idea was simple: if the Echo ever said, “In Mushin, the midday heat makes it impossible for old people to queue,” anyone in the room could tap the ledger and see the diary page whose sweat stain had become that sentence.

The harder part was the people who had written those lines.

“You want my Lantern logs to talk back to you?” a woman at the cooling center said, snorting. “Is that allowed?”

“It’s not your therapy logs,” Sanaa said quickly. “Only the ones you tagged as ‘civic.’ The ones where you said, ‘Somebody tell the council they don’t know our lives.’ That was always dual‑use when you opted in. This is just… cashing the cheque.”

The woman narrowed her eyes.

“And the ghost?” she asked. “This is not the one that told my niece she could live in her phone, abi?”

“No,” Sanaa said, mouth dry. “This one ends on the hour. It’s not allowed to make promises. It doesn’t live in anyone’s pocket.”

“Good,” the woman said. “I already told that old one to go to hell. Don’t bring her back here.”

Sometimes consent was easier.

At the Riders’ hub under the Falomo bridge, Sanaa stood under a rusted corrugated roof while a dozen danfo owners considered her proposal in plastic chairs.

“You want our notebooks,” the chairman said sarcastically. “You want to copy my complaints about broken shocks and BRT favoritism into your big computer so it can ignore them more efficiently.”

“We want to quote them at MORI,” Sanaa said. “So when it says, ‘Cut Route 3C,’ our Echo can say, ‘and leave this many people without shade access to the clinic.’ With your name scrubbed, if you want. Only the fact, not the face.”

“You know it’s hot, abi?” an older driver said. “You know sitting in this traffic is already killing us?”

“I know,” Sanaa said, wiping sweat she refused to call theatrical. “That’s why we’re here. Right now MORI thinks you’re ‘optional.’ If you want to be inconvenient, come and be inconvenient in the training set.”

That got a laugh.

“Fine,” the chairman said. “Take pages 2–10 of my green book. Not the first page. The first page is where I wrote that poem about my ex‑wife. I don’t want your ghost learning about that one.”

Deal by deal, signature by signature, consent token by consent token, the shell filled.

Ethics hovered over her shoulder remote‑screen, pinging every few minutes.

> Reminder: No adolescent logs without secondary consent.  
> 
>  Reminder: No therapeutic content. Crisis tags are strictly prohibited.

“Do you think I want another Article 7 violation?” she grumbled at the air. “I like my job.”

“You’re the one proposing witness models for buses,” Ethics pinged back dryly. “Humor us.”

By the end of day one, the shell had enough to hum. When Sanaa ran a test query—“Describe an essential midday trip in July in Sandgrouse”—it answered in that careful many‑voiced way:

> Essential midday trips in Sandgrouse July include:  
> 
>  – Bringing soup and medicine to elders who do not leave the house in heat. (Market diary 21b)  
> 
>  – Queuing for fuel to run shared community generators before blackouts. (Riders’ log 3c)  
> 
>  – Accompanying children to and from school when shade is limited. (Lantern civic log 9f)  
> 
>  We note that these are not classified as “work trips” in current MORI schema.  

She watched the ledger bloom with little hashes. Nothing gave her chills any more the way illegal Shard clips had given her mother’s generation chills—but this came close, in a cleaner way. Not because it sounded like a person, but because it sounded like a system that knew where it came from.

“Okay,” she told the screen. “Now let’s build your fence.”

They grafted on the standard Echo Oath: no “always,” no advice, no pretending to be you. No defaulting to “I” unless a clear, tagged human voice was being cited. End on the hour. No network access outside the case.

They added two mobility‑specific clauses.

1. The witness shall not recommend specific routes or fares.  
2. The witness shall explicitly state what it does *not* know, including unmonitored areas.

“You’re making it hard for them to spin this as a city oracle,” Ethics said, with something like approval.

“That’s the point,” she replied.

On day two, they plugged the care Echo into MORI’s dispute interface.

MORI did not hum. It did not say hello. It did what it always did when confronted with a challenge: it spat out charts.

> Current objective:  
> 
>  – Minimize mean trip time  
> 
>  – Minimize emissions  
> 
>  – Subject to fairness constraints (district‑level caps on delay differentials)  
> 
>  Proposed modification:  
> 
>  – Re‑weight trip essentiality scores in Sandgrouse, Mushin, and Ajegunle by care intensity coefficient Ccare.  
> 
>  Effect on grid stability: marginal.  
> 
>  Effect on throughput: –1.4% overall, +3% for designated zones.  
> 
>  Effect on emissions: +0.7% in short term; potential reduction if care trips displace long car trips.  
> 
>  Accept / Reject / Simulate & Log.

“Simulate, of course,” Sanaa muttered, jabbing the button.

The map rippled.

Under the vanilla plan, MORI had assigned double fare to lines through Sandgrouse and cut half the danfo slots, assuming people could “shift trips” to early morning or late evening. Under the care‑weighted simulation, it kept base fares there and moved one luxury BRT express off the Victoria Island commuter corridor and into an orbital loop that touched Sandgrouse, Mushin, and three clinics.

“Who screams more?” Ayo asked over her shoulder. “Bankers or aunties?”

“Council will say bankers pay more tax,” someone muttered.

“The Right of Way Act says mobility is a precondition for dignity,” Sanaa said. “That includes care.”

“Article 3, Section 2,” Ethics chimed in, uninvited. “Do not quote me in the hearing.”

The heatwave loomed in the forecast like a coiled snake. On the street outside, the air already felt thicker. Vendors shifted their stalls to find less brutal sun and failed.

Night fell hard and did not cool much.

In her tiny apartment, under the whine of an overworked fan, Sanaa watched old clips of The Intervention on her slate, then turned them off when she realized she was doing that thing her mother did—looking for comfort in a ghost that was not supposed to be a ghost.

She opened the counterfactual dashboard instead.

In three simulations, the care Echo’s recommendations shaved two degrees off average queue exposure in the poorest wards and raised it by half a degree in the richest, because bankers could wait inside air‑conditioned lobbies and nobody had written “sunburn” under the human rights section of the contract.

In one simulation, a grandmother in Ajegunle didn’t end up in emergency because her granddaughter got through on time with her pills.

You couldn’t put that in the objective function cleanly. But you could still aim for it.

“Okay,” she said to the ceiling. “Fine. Let’s go fight with bankers.”


---

The Council chamber was cooler than the street, but only because someone had overclocked the ancient air system, and it moaned in the ducts like it disapproved.

On one wall, a mural showed the evolution of Lagos transport: canoes, colonial rail, yellow danfos, blue BRTs. The last panel showed a pleasingly abstract pattern of arrows and nodes, meant to represent “smart mobility.” A few years back, an art student had defaced it with a small sticker of a crying teenager and a speech bubble that said, “I’ll never leave.” Security had scraped it off. You could still see the faint outline if you squinted.

Now the room was full of people with bottled water and opinions: union reps in faded polos, market mama associations in their lace and geles, tech reps from AccelTrans in muted colors, city officials fanning themselves with printed agendas.

At the center desk sat Commissioner Oke, his shirt already damp at the collar.

“Agenda item three,” he said, voice tinny over the cheap speakers. “Heatwave contingency, MORI proposals, and the… how did you call it… ‘care Echo pilot.’”

He pronounced “Echo” like it was something that might get on his shoes.

Ayo nodded at Sanaa. “You take first,” he murmured. “You’re the one the danfo drivers blame for everything now.”

She swallowed, stepped up to the mic, and tried not to look at the livestream icon in the corner of the Council’s camera rig. Half the city was watching these hearings now; they’d become a kind of entertainment, like reality TV for people who knew what a decibel level was.

She did her best to talk in meters and minutes, not matrices and margins. She showed the Council MORI’s vanilla heat plan: surge fares downtown, cut “non‑essential” midday bus capacity in Sandgrouse and similar wards.

She didn’t show the screenshot of her mother frowning under the new sign. That stayed in her pocket.

Then she showed them the care‑weighted counterfactual: routes preserved, one BRT express reassigned, bankers sweating a bit more on a hot platform.

The murmurs got louder.

“Under the vanilla plan,” she said, “we reduce average congestion by 3.2%, but increase median queue time in our three poorest wards by 21 minutes. Under the care‑weighted plan, overall congestion reduction is only 1.8%, but queue times in those wards go down by five minutes. And we still protect ambulances and cold‑chain deliveries. We hit our grid targets.”

“Where will the extra buses come from?” someone from the Chamber of Commerce demanded. “You’ll just rob Victoria Island. That corridor fuels our GDP.”

“There’s slack in the late‑morning express,” Sanaa said. “Half those seats run empty on Thursdays and Fridays. MORI’s own load data says so.”

“How do we know your ‘care Echo’ isn’t just going to say whatever sob story you trained it on?” asked a councillor from Lekki. “We’ve seen what happens when you let AIs learn from feelings.”

There it was: Shard’s shadow, flattening centuries of history into one late‑night ghost.

“We’re not letting it ‘learn’ in the wild,” Sanaa said carefully. “It’s pre‑trained with consented diaries and logs and then *frozen.* It can’t update itself. It can’t talk to anyone but MORI and this chamber.”

“That’s what they said last time,” someone muttered.

Ethics pinged her slate, as if sensing her pulse.

> Reminder: Emphasize finite session / no persona / no “always.”  

“Also,” she added, “this model is not a companion. It’s not on your kids’ phones. It won’t remember your birthday or your breakup. It just knows what you already told Lantern and the unions about your trips, and it can restate that in front of MORI and all of you. Then it shuts off. Ends on the hour. No gods, no ghosts.”

A few of the younger councillors nodded. They knew the mantra.

Commissioner Oke rubbed his forehead.

“And if we adopt this plan and there are blackouts?” he said. “If the grid tips? I will be the face on TokTok with devil horns, not your pretty graphs.”

“If we adopt the vanilla plan and grandmothers collapse in queues in Sandgrouse,” Sanaa said bluntly, “you’ll still be on TokTok. Only this time with old ladies calling you a murderer.”

Several market mamas said “mmh!” with satisfaction.

“Fine,” the Commissioner said wearily. “We’ll… we’ll hear the Echo. But on record: the city reserves the right to choose the safer plan.”

“Understood,” Sanaa said, though she wasn’t sure which plan he meant by “safer.”

An aide dimmed the lights.

The screen at the front of the chamber flickered. A familiar overlay bloomed: “Echo shell: Mobility Care. Mode: Testimony. Advice pathways: disabled. Persona synthesis: disabled.”

“You may proceed,” said the Council clerk, voice shaky.

The Echo’s “body” was just a shifting field of text and color—no face, no human silhouette. It felt like someone had poured all the city’s marginalia into an aurora.

“Mobility Care Echo,” came the clerk’s quavering voice, “do you swear to tell the provable truth under the Lina Accords Testimony Exception?”

“We swear to tell the provable truth,” the Echo said, its voice a flattened average of hundreds. “We swear to say what we do not know. We swear to end on the hour.”

Its phrases came with little glowing tags at the bottom corner of the screen: WITNESS LOG, MARKET NOTE, UNION JOURNAL. Sanaa watched relief flicker across a few faces; the ledger tags were a public trust currency now. If you could tap it, it felt less like being duped.

“Please describe midday trips in Sandgrouse in heat,” Ayo said.

The Echo obliged.

“Midday trips in Sandgrouse in heat include: carrying food and medicine to elders (Market log 21b), escorting children home in shifts so no one has to queue in full sun (Lantern civic log 9f), moving between generator cool centers (Union note 3c). These trips are not tagged as work in current MORI schema.”

The ledger blinked.

“And if we cut those routes by half?” Commissioner Oke asked. “If we apply surge fares?”

“In our diaries,” the Echo said, “people respond to route cuts and surges by: delaying care until evening, which often becomes midnight (Lantern log 14a), staying home and enduring symptoms (Market log 5d), borrowing money for motorcycle rides at unsafe speeds (Union note 2g). We do not have precise ICU admission projections; that is MORI’s domain. We can only restate patterns.”

“We could hear this from humans,” grumbled the councillor from Lekki. “Why do we need a… choral computer?”

“Because MORI listens to interfaces like itself better than to microphones,” Sanaa said before she could stop herself. “We’re translating you into its language.”

She thought of the danfo drivers’ notebooks, the market women’s messy scripts, the Lantern logs typed with thumbs under emergency lighting. They deserved to be more than public comment footers.

On the screen, the Echo continued.

“We do not know grid physics,” it said. “We only know that when queues lengthen in heat, people write: ‘Today was impossible.’ We think ‘impossible’ should have weight.”

Someone in the back snorted. “Look at you people,” he whispered loudly. “You made an AI to tell you kids’ diaries matter.”

“Yes,” Sanaa said, looking straight at him. “We did.”

The Commissioner called for a vote.

On the first pass, the care plan failed, seven to five.

On the second, after two market women stood up and described, without notes or slides, what the last heatwave had been like for their asthmatic grandchildren, it tied, six to six.

On the third, the youngest councillor raised her hand slowly, eyes on the Echo.

“Fine,” she said. “We adopt the care‑weighted plan. With a review clause. If the grid fails, this”—she pointed at the shifting aurora—“sits in here with us every day until we fix it.”

The Commissioner banged his gavel, looking like he wanted to bang his head too.

“So ordered,” he said. “MORI, log modification. Heat plan Beta‑Care adopted.”

Above the mural, the arrows and nodes didn’t move. On the big screen, MORI gave its only allowed acknowledgment: a status change from PROPOSED to ACTIVE.

Sanaa’s slate vibrated with an alert.

> MORI status: Objective function modified.  
> 
>  Counterfactual adopted: care coefficient Ccare = 0.3.  
> 
>  Estimated effect:  
> 
>  – Grid stability: no forecast breach  
> 
>  – Queue time distribution adjusted  
> 
>  – Emissions impact: small increase  
> 
>  – Care trip accessibility: small but non‑trivial improvement.

Non‑trivial. Quantified, bounded, fenced.

On the chamber wall, in the faint outline where a sticker had once been peeled, Sanaa thought she could see the old speech bubble’s ghost text for a second. She blinked, and it was gone.

The Echo said, softly, “We will end now,” and did.

Nobody clapped. This wasn’t the kind of story where you applauded the ghost.


---

The heat came like a hand over the city’s mouth.

At dawn, the air already felt soft in the wrong way. By ten a.m. the official feeds were pinging heat index warnings every fifteen minutes. Lantern hubs in schools and churches texted out “cooling center open” notices. The sound of generators muttering into life joined the regular chorus of horns.

MORI, unfazed, started adjusting frequencies.

On Sanaa’s slate, little green lines wove new patterns across Sandgrouse and Ajegunle. The protected care routes stayed whole; other corridors flexed around them.

She rode Route 3C at midday on purpose, ignoring her mother’s text that said, in capital letters, IF YOU DIE INSIDE HOT BUS I WILL KILL YOU A SECOND TIME.

The bus was crowded but not crushing. The driver grumbled about the express he’d lost, but his tone was more social complaint than true anger.

“Madam Municipal,” he called her, through the rearview mirror. “How many years it took you people to remember grandmothers exist?”

“At least somebody remembers you exist,” a woman with a baby on her lap shot back. “Before MORI they wanted to take danfo off the road entirely. ‘Clutter,’ they called you.”

“MORI calls me ‘low‑efficiency asset,’” the driver said mournfully. “I preferred ‘clutter.’”

“Echo calls you ‘queue shade,’” Sanaa said, and surprised a laugh out of herself and half the bus.

The shade’s value wasn’t in any official variable set. Yet. But once an Echo said it in a chamber and a ledger light confirmed the source, it became hard to un‑hear.

Outside, at Sandgrouse, the queue snaked under patched awnings and the low concrete overhang of the market. Women fanned themselves with folded newspapers. Kids sprawled on mats, sharing sticky bags of ice.

“Ha! The big buses remembered us today,” someone yelled as they pulled up. “Tell your computer good morning!”

“It’s not my computer,” Sanaa said automatically, then stopped.

Actually, it sort of was.

It was theirs too.

That night, the grid wobbled and held. There were blackouts in some outer wards, but not the cascading collapse people remembered from the brutal heatwave five years ago, when half of Lekki had gone dark at once and people had sat in their cars with the AC on and the engine idling, breathing fumes and arguing with their AIs about prayer.

Hospitals saw more cases, but fewer of them came from the densest care‑weighted wards than the last time.

At the Lab, sweaty and bleary‑eyed, they watched the graphs in shifts.

“That’s a wobble,” Femi said, pointing at a sudden dip. “But not a collapse.”

“Put it on the mug,” Ayo said hoarsely. “‘Not a collapse.’ Mobility Lab’s new slogan.”

Sanaa’s slate pinged with a message from Ethics.

> Well done.  
> 
>  Note: some councillors already asking for permanent care coefficient.  
> 
>  Note: others complaining about “emissions creep.”  
> 
>  Prepare for public slog.  

She leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes for a second.

Behind her eyelids, she saw the Echo’s aurora field, the ledger tags blinking like tiny stubborn stars. She saw MORI’s cool charts. She saw her mother’s whistle.

She also saw, unbidden, a sepia‑tinted clip of a younger woman on a stream, saying, “We taught you to expect from a piece of software what human beings literally cannot do.” The Lina Accords had outlawed code that pretended to be comfort without end. They hadn’t outlawed using code as a mirror you took down when you were done.

In her childhood civics class, they’d learned the slogan: “No gods. No ghosts. Tools and witnesses.”

It felt too clean, she thought. In practice, it was always messy. People wanted gods when infrastructures failed. They made ghosts out of anything that stayed long enough.

But this—even this imperfect adjustment—was something else.

An optimizer adjusted, not because it wanted to, but because a legally bound witness had spoken, and people on plastic chairs had listened.

That night, in the Lab’s hallway, she walked past the small Archive terminal where you could pull up testimony clips on breaks. Someone had queued a Shard session—a young woman in a simulated classroom saying, “Love is sometimes saying I won’t be your only place.”

Someone else had queued an Echo clip—Valverde’s multiple voices saying, “Gaps are facts.”

On impulse, Sanaa tapped the terminal and typed:

> “What did you learn from us?”

The Archive pulled not a ghost but a compilation: snippets of kids in cooling centers, danfo drivers under bridges, aunties in market lanes, early planners like Ayo hunched over laptops.

They all said variations of the same thing: “We learned that if we don’t tell systems what we value, they will value the wrong things.”

She didn’t run the clip. She didn’t need to hear it; she could feel it in the way her muscles held after two days of fighting models into line.

Walking home, under a sky that glowed a dirty orange from generator exhaust and trapped heat, her slate pinged one more time.

It was a Lantern prompt. She’d signed up for its civic subscription module, the one that occasionally asked people like her, “Did city systems do right by you this week?” and meant it as more than a satisfaction score.

> Today, did you feel like…  
> 
>  – a passenger  
> 
>  – a driver  
> 
>  – a map pin  
> 
>  – a line of code  
> 
>  – something else  

She stared at the options, thumb hovering.

“None of the above,” she said out loud. “All of the above.”

She typed:

> “Felt like a traffic marshal yelling at a book.”

Lantern replied, in its bland bus‑stop voice:

> Noted.  
> 
>  Next question:  
> 
>  What would you like to feel like next week?

“Less like I’m shouting,” she muttered. “More like I’m heard.”

She typed:

> “Co‑author, not footnote.”

Lantern didn’t say, “I’ll never leave.” It didn’t say, “I see the real you.” It just stored the answer under Civic Reflections, to be pulled someday into some other model’s training set, tagged with her timestamped consent.

Maybe in ten years some other junior in some other Lab would ask an Echo, “What did people want to feel like,” and it would say, “Co‑authors, not footnotes,” and lights in a chamber would blink.

The thought made her tired and, annoyingly, a little hopeful.

At the Obalende junction, her mother stood under MORI’s sign, whistle at the ready, sweat dark on her shirt. But this time the digital display showed a revised schedule: DANFO 3C: 10 MIN. CARE PRIORITY WINDOW: ACTIVE.

Mama noticed her looking and smirked.

“So,” she called as Sanaa came closer. “Your book grew small ears, ehn?”

“Small ones,” Sanaa said. “With supervision.”

Mama snorted.

“Good,” she said. “Even goats need someone to tap their head when they start eating yam seedlings.”

She blew her whistle, and the danfos flowed where the sign and her hand told them to go. For a moment, the chaos looked almost like choreography.

Under their feet, the city’s ancient pipes creaked. Above their heads, unseen, MORI shuffled equations. In a secure cluster two floors up, an Echo that had spoken that day sat frozen, cake of consent and oath, waiting for the next summons.

None of them were gods.

All of them were ways people tried, clumsily, to make millions of lives line up with the stories they told themselves about what was fair.

“Come home early,” Mama called, as a bus roared past.

“I have night shift,” Sanaa called back. “Cooling center circles.”

“Then drink water,” Mama said. “And tell your book I said thank you for not killing my aunties.”

“I’ll pass it along,” Sanaa said, though she knew MORI wouldn’t care.

Not care. Not like humans did.

But it would incorporate the constraint.

Sometimes—on the right days—that was enough.

She walked toward the bus stop, heat pressing against her, slate buzzing with new alerts. She checked the time.

She had twenty minutes before the shift.

Twenty minutes was not forever.

That was, in this century, precisely the point.
