## The Star-Stopper’s Lullaby

### Prologue: A Folktale With Teeth

They used to tell the story like a dare.

In certain corners of the net—forums with dim layouts and older moderators who spoke in careful sentences—people whispered about a device called the **Tox Uthat**. The name always looked wrong, like it had been translated twice and still didn’t sit correctly in the mouth.

A 26th-century machine, the posts claimed. A thing that could **stop nuclear fusion in a star**.

Not *explode* a star. Not *poison* it. Not trigger a supernova like the myths of science fiction liked to do, loud and theatrical.

Just… *stop it*.

Quench it. Snuff it, like pinching the flame of a candle between your fingers.

No one could agree on how the device arrived in this century, in this timeline. Some said a collapsed wormhole. Some said a time-delivery meant for someone else, misaddressed by a century and a hemisphere. Some said it fell out of a sky that wasn’t ours—a future that had tried to escape itself and shed its most dangerous secret like a snake shedding skin.

But all versions ended the same way:

If the Tox Uthat was real, it was the most valuable object on Earth and the most terrifying.

And it was loose.

### 1. The Young Lady Who Would Not Let It Go

Her name was **Mara Vance**, and she had the kind of curiosity that felt less like a trait and more like a weather system.

Curiosity made her take apart a radio at nine years old and put it back together with a leftover screw. Curiosity made her enroll in astrophysics and drop out halfway through, not because she couldn’t do the math, but because she couldn’t tolerate the slowness of permission: grant proposals, committee meetings, approvals to look at the sky as if the sky belonged to bureaucrats.

Curiosity made her work salvage instead—illegal-adjacent retrieval jobs, the kind that took her into flooded data centers after storms, down into collapsed subway arteries after tremors, or up to the carcasses of decommissioned orbital hardware that fell in pieces like tired meteors.

The world rewarded a certain kind of bravery with applause.

It rewarded Mara’s kind with *rumors*.

A month before everything changed, she was in **Lisbon**, sitting on the edge of a rooftop that overlooked the river, listening to a contact describe a crate that had never been on any manifest.

“Not government?” Mara asked.

“Not any government I can name,” the contact said. He kept his eyes on the skyline, as if the buildings might start confessing. “Not corporate, not military. It was… wrong.”

Wrong how?

“It didn’t look old. It didn’t look new. It looked like it didn’t have a time.”

Mara felt her pulse lean forward.

“Where is it now?”

The contact hesitated. That was the first tell, the smallest betrayal.

“Don’t,” he said. “I’m serious. Don’t. This is… folklore that bites.”

“Everything bites,” Mara replied. “Some things just have better teeth.”

He gave her a small, tired laugh—like he had once been young enough to believe curiosity was a virtue in itself.

Then he sent her a file.

No explanatory note. Just coordinates, a timestamp, and a single scanned image that made Mara sit up so sharply she nearly slid off the roof.

The image was a photograph of an object: a palm-sized polyhedron, matte-black, with edges that didn’t reflect light so much as refuse it. A thing with no obvious seams. No markings. No ports. It looked like the idea of a machine, stripped down to a pure geometric stubbornness.

Beneath the photo was a label—handwritten in a tight script that seemed almost embarrassed by the words.

**TOX UTHAT**

Mara stared until her eyes prickled.

A star-stopper.

A device so impossible it had become a bedtime story told to scientists who didn’t sleep anymore.

She whispered the name again, tasting it like a challenge.

“Tox Uthat.”

And then, without allowing herself time to feel how afraid she was, she began to pack.

Wealth. Fame. Adventure. Status.

But above all, the private thirst she rarely admitted out loud:

To know what was true.

### 2. Mr. Picard, Sent by the World

The first time Mara saw **Mr. Picard**, she did not know his name.

She only knew the posture: a man who looked like he had been trained to occupy rooms without asking permission. He was in the same underground bar in Lisbon, not sitting *with* anyone, but positioned so he could see every entrance and every shadowed corridor as if he’d mapped the place in his head the moment he stepped inside.

He was older than Mara by a couple decades—mid-forties, maybe. Neatly dressed in a way that didn’t invite attention but also didn’t apologize for itself. Not a rich man’s expensive suit; a professional’s durable uniform pretending not to be one.

Mara’s contact—the one who’d sent the file—spotted him too, and went pale in a way that had nothing to do with lighting.

“Who’s that?” Mara asked.

Her contact’s mouth opened, closed. He looked like he was about to lie and realized he couldn’t afford the effort.

“That,” he said quietly, “is the kind of person who makes people disappear politely.”

Mara’s interest sharpened.

The man glanced over, just once.

His eyes met hers like a hand resting briefly on a door handle, confirming its weight.

Then he looked away.

A second later, Mara’s contact stood up so abruptly his chair scraped the floor.

“I have to go,” he said.

Mara caught his wrist. “We had a deal.”

His skin felt cold.

“There are deals,” he whispered, “and then there’s survival.”

He leaned in until his breath brushed her ear.

“Whatever you’re chasing, you’re not the only one. And someone important has decided they don’t like the idea of amateurs holding it.”

He pulled free and disappeared into the press of bodies.

Mara turned back toward the older man.

He was gone too.

Only the sensation remained—that she had just stepped into a game whose rules she did not yet understand.

### 3. The Map That Wasn’t a Map

The coordinates led Mara to a storage facility outside the city, one of those modern warehouses that looked anonymous enough to hide anything, including the truth.

She broke in not with movie theatrics but with the simple competence of someone who’d done it before: spoof the lock signal, slip the camera loop, keep her heartbeat from making decisions.

Unit 19C contained a steel case, half-buried under obsolete telecom hardware.

The case had no brand name.

No shipping labels.

Only a symbol etched into the metal—a circle intersected by a line, like an eclipse cut by a horizon.

Mara’s fingers hovered above it.

She waited for the irrational part of her mind to scream *this is wrong.*

It didn’t scream.

It only leaned closer.

She opened the case.

Inside was not the device itself.

Inside was a **fragment**: a thin plate of dark material, lighter than it should be, warmer than the surrounding air, as if it carried its own thermal opinion. When she lifted it, she felt a faint vibration in her bones, a subtle pressure behind her eyes, like standing too close to a subwoofer you couldn’t hear.

The plate’s surface held patterns—microscopic ridges that looked almost decorative until her salvage-trained instincts recognized them as *structured information*, like the grooves of a record.

A data medium.

Or a key.

Her own equipment wouldn’t read it. Neither would most of what existed in civilian hands.

Which meant she needed help.

And help was dangerous, because help came with questions.

As Mara repacked the fragment, she heard the softest sound: a footstep in the corridor outside.

Then another.

Not hurried. Not uncertain. The kind of approach that assumed the world would accommodate it.

Mara closed the case and slid it back into its hiding place. She moved to the side wall, near a stack of fiber spools, and held her breath.

The unit door opened.

The light snapped on.

A man stepped in.

It was him.

The older one from the bar.

He did not search frantically. He did not call out. He simply stood still and looked around as if listening to the room’s shape.

“Mara Vance,” he said, pronouncing her name with calm accuracy.

Mara did not move.

“I’m not here to harm you,” he continued. “But you are trespassing in a situation you don’t understand.”

Mara’s hand tightened on the small cutting tool in her pocket.

“You’re following me,” she said.

“Yes.”

“Why?”

A pause. Then:

“Because you’re the most likely person to get yourself killed in the next forty-eight hours.”

Mara exhaled a bitter laugh. “That’s not much of an explanation.”

He turned his head slightly, looking directly toward where she hid, though she couldn’t tell if he truly saw her or had simply calculated the most probable position.

“My name is **Picard**,” he said. “I work for the **Planetary Intelligence Council**.”

Mara stepped out into the light.

“Planetary,” she repeated, tasting the word. “Like the planet has a single mind now?”

Picard’s expression tightened—not offended, but weighed down.

“Not a single mind. A negotiated one. A desperate one.”

He glanced toward the hidden case.

“You took something,” he said.

Mara lied with the confidence of practice. “I didn’t.”

Picard regarded her for a long moment.

Then he said something that rearranged the air in Mara’s lungs.

“The Tox Uthat,” he said quietly, “is not a story.”

Mara’s mouth went dry.

Picard continued. “And the people hunting it are not looking to get rich. They are looking to own a lever that can move nations by threatening the sky itself.”

Mara’s instincts screamed at her to run.

Her curiosity—the weather system inside her—insisted she stay.

“If it’s real,” Mara said, “it could change everything.”

“Yes,” Picard replied. “That’s why you cannot have it.”

Mara lifted her chin. “And why should *you*?”

Picard’s gaze didn’t harden; it softened, which was worse.

“I don’t want it,” he said. “I want it *unfound*.”

---

### 4. The Other Hunters

They left the storage facility together because staying would have been suicide. Picard didn’t order her. He simply made it clear, through the economy of his movements, that the hunters were already close enough to smell opportunity.

In the parking lot, Mara spotted them: three people crossing between rows of cars in loose formation, as if casually strolling. Their clothes were ordinary. Their faces were unremarkable.

But Mara had lived long enough among criminals to recognize the truth:

The best predators look like pedestrians.

Picard touched Mara’s elbow once—a brief guiding pressure—and they moved.

Not running.

Running would have admitted guilt and narrowed options.

They walked, turned a corner, and slipped between two delivery trucks. Picard keyed something on a device no larger than a coin, and one of the trucks’ doors unlocked with a soft click. They climbed inside, crouched behind pallets of packaged parts, and waited.

Mara’s heartbeat was loud in her throat.

“How did you—” she started.

Picard held up a finger.

Outside, footsteps approached. Voices murmured in a language Mara didn’t recognize.

Then a sound that made her blood go cold: a handheld scanner pinging softly, sweeping for electronics, heat signatures, maybe something else.

The footsteps paused near the truck.

Mara held her breath.

Picard’s calm did not waver, but she noticed his hand: he held it close to his side, ready, the way someone held a weapon without needing to show it.

The scanner passed. The voices receded.

Only when the sound faded into distance did Picard speak.

“They have resources,” he said. “They have patience. And they’ve been informed you exist.”

Mara swallowed. “By my contact.”

Picard’s silence confirmed it.

Mara’s anger flared hot. “So what, I’m bait?”

“No,” Picard said. “You’re a complication. And you’re also a human being, which matters more than you’re currently treating it.”

Mara stared at him, startled by the bluntness.

Picard met her gaze.

“You want wealth,” he said. “You want fame. But I’ve read your file. What you actually want is *meaning*. You want to touch a truth so big it changes you.”

Mara’s hands curled into fists. “Don’t pretend you know me.”

Picard’s voice lowered. “Then prove me wrong. Hand over what you took.”

Mara hesitated.

Because she had taken it.

Because she could feel the fragment’s faint warmth even through layers of cloth, like it was listening.

And because, for the first time, she realized that if she gave it up, she might never again be close to the answer that had haunted her since childhood: *what else is possible?*

“I can help,” she said instead. “You need me.”

Picard looked at her with something that might have been pity.

“I need you alive,” he said. “That’s not the same thing.”

---

### 5. The Language of the Future

They went to a place that wasn’t on any map Mara could access: a small, clean room beneath an unmarked building near the river, where the walls carried faint hums that suggested shielded electronics.

Picard didn’t hand her restraints or demand compliance. He offered her water. That, in its own way, was the most disarming tactic of all.

On a worktable sat instruments Mara recognized and others she didn’t. Spectrometers, microscopes, signal analyzers—and a sealed container with warning symbols written in three languages.

Picard nodded toward Mara’s bag. “The fragment.”

Mara took it out slowly, as if removing a wild animal from its cage.

When she placed it on the table, the room’s ambient hum shifted. A sensor on the wall flickered.

Picard’s eyes narrowed. “It’s active.”

“It’s doing something,” Mara whispered.

Picard brought a scanner over it. The screen filled with cascading nonsense—values that spiked, dropped, and stabilized in patterns that looked too elegant to be random.

“This isn’t an artifact,” Mara said. “It’s a *message*.”

Picard’s mouth tightened. “Or a beacon.”

Mara’s skin prickled.

Picard reached into a drawer and removed something that made Mara’s breath catch: a small object in a sealed pouch, similar material, similar wrongness.

“You have another piece,” she said.

Picard didn’t deny it.

“We recovered it six months ago,” he admitted. “From a private collection in Nuuk. The collector thought it was a sculpture.”

Mara stared. “And you couldn’t decode it.”

“We could not even agree on what it was,” Picard replied. “Until your fragment appeared.”

Mara leaned closer. Her mind moved fast, faster than fear.

“If two pieces resonate,” she murmured, “then they might be part of a larger system.”

Picard’s gaze sharpened. “And the larger system would be—”

“The Tox Uthat,” Mara finished.

The word hung between them like a blade.

Picard placed his fragment near hers.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then the air changed.

Not with sound, but with pressure—like the room inhaled. Mara felt the hair on her arms rise. The sensors on the wall lit in sequence, a ripple of nervous telemetry.

On the table, the two fragments vibrated gently, aligning themselves without physically moving, as if an invisible field corrected their relationship.

A line of light appeared—not emitted, but *revealed*, like the material had stopped hiding it.

Symbols bloomed across the surface.

Not letters.

Not numbers.

Something older and newer at once: a geometry of intention.

Mara’s mind, which had always been hungry, suddenly felt full—overfull—like someone had poured a new color into her brain.

She understood none of it consciously.

And yet, she knew what it was doing.

“It’s giving us coordinates,” she whispered.

Picard’s expression tightened. “Where?”

Mara’s fingers hovered over the projected pattern, tracing it as if her skin could translate.

“Not a place,” she said slowly. “A time… and a place.”

Picard’s jaw clenched.

Mara looked up at him.

“It didn’t fall into our century by accident,” she said. “It was *sent*.”

Picard’s voice was quiet. “Then whoever sent it may have wanted it found.”

Mara’s stomach sank.

“Or wanted it to be fought over,” she whispered.

---

### 6. The Auction of Dangerous Things

The coordinates led them to a location that made Mara laugh once, sharply, without humor.

“Of course,” she said. “An auction.”

Picard didn’t smile.

It wasn’t a public auction with paddles and champagne. It was a private exchange disguised as philanthropy, hosted in a coastal villa whose white walls gleamed like teeth.

Mara attended as someone else: hair pinned differently, lenses in her eyes, a dress that made her feel like she’d put on another person’s skin. Picard became a shadow in tailored clothing, his earpiece hidden, his movements precise.

“Remember,” he told her before they entered, “you do not improvise.”

Mara lifted an eyebrow. “Improvisation is half my skill set.”

“And it’s the half that gets you killed,” Picard replied.

Inside, the air smelled like money and saltwater. Men and women drifted through rooms filled with art that looked expensive and bored.

The lots were not displayed openly. Buyers were led, one at a time, into a back room where items appeared briefly—enough to confirm authenticity, not enough to invite theft.

Mara’s nerves buzzed. She could sense the predators here too, masked by elegance. People who had never held a gun but could order a war with a phone call.

Picard murmured in her earpiece. “Three o’clock. That man. Gray suit. That’s **Rossen Vale**.”

The name flicked something in Mara’s memory: Vale, the industrialist whose energy conglomerate had been implicated in sabotage of competing fusion startups.

“He’s one of the bad actors,” Mara whispered.

“Yes,” Picard said. “And he’s not the only one.”

Mara moved through the crowd, pretending interest in paintings while tracking conversations. Names surfaced like sharks’ fins: financiers, private military contractors, tech executives who spoke softly about “stability” and “leverage” as if those words weren’t synonyms for control.

Then Mara saw it.

Not the Tox Uthat itself.

But a case—black, matte, wrong in the same way the fragments were wrong.

Her breath caught.

The case was being carried by two security guards toward the back room.

Picard’s voice tightened. “Stay calm.”

Mara’s curiosity surged like a wave.

“That’s it,” she whispered. “It’s here.”

Picard said, very carefully, “Mara. You are not to approach.”

But Mara was already moving.

Not because she wanted to disobey.

Because something inside her—the same force that had driven her to dismantle radios and drop out of polite academia—could not bear the idea of being this close to a truth and letting it walk away.

She slipped behind a curtain into a corridor lined with closed doors.

Her heel barely clicked on the tile.

Ahead, the guards entered a room and closed the door behind them.

Mara waited two seconds, then reached for the handle.

It opened.

Inside, the lighting was dim and clinical. The case sat on a table. A woman in a fitted suit stood beside it, her expression professional, her eyes sharp.

And Rossen Vale was there too.

He turned at the sound of the door.

His gaze landed on Mara and widened slightly, as if recognizing her from some briefing file.

“Well,” Vale said softly, almost pleased. “The curiosity girl.”

Mara’s blood went cold.

The woman in the suit raised a small device—compact, black.

Not a gun.

Something worse.

Picard’s voice snapped in Mara’s ear. “Mara, get out—now.”

Too late.

The woman pressed the device.

Mara felt a sudden pressure in her skull, like an invisible fist. Her vision doubled. Her muscles hesitated. The room tilted.

A sonic or neural disruptor.

Vale stepped forward calmly, as if Mara were a chess piece he’d expected to capture.

“You’ve been very helpful,” he said. “Bringing the Council’s agent right to us.”

Mara fought to keep her feet. “You don’t know what you’re doing.”

Vale’s smile was thin.

“Oh,” he said, “I know exactly what I’m doing.”

He tapped the case.

“I’m buying the future.”

---

### 7. The Agent and the Thief

The door exploded inward.

Not with fire, but with a violent mechanical crack, as if the lock had been convinced it no longer had authority.

Picard entered like a storm that had learned manners.

He moved quickly, efficiently—disarming one guard with a twist of wrist and elbow, shoving the other into the wall hard enough to make him slide down. The woman with the disruptor lifted it again.

Picard fired a compact weapon Mara hadn’t seen—nonlethal, a pulse that made the woman convulse and drop.

Vale stumbled backward, more surprised than frightened.

Picard’s gaze locked onto him.

“Rossen Vale,” Picard said, voice level. “You’re under arrest on behalf of the Planetary Intelligence Council.”

Vale laughed once.

“You don’t have a planet,” he said. “You have a negotiation.”

His hand snapped toward the case.

Mara, still dizzy, acted on instinct.

She lunged—not toward Vale, but toward the case.

Her fingers touched the matte surface—

—and the world changed.

For a split second, Mara saw *something else*: not the room, not the villa, but a field of stars with a dark seam running through them, like a rip in fabric. A sense of immense distance, immense time, and a cold intelligence that did not feel human.

Then her vision snapped back.

The case clicked open by itself, as if recognizing her touch.

Inside lay the device.

The **Tox Uthat** was smaller than Mara expected. Not a massive machine, not a weapon with barrels or blades, but a compact shape nested in foam that seemed more ceremonial than protective.

A polyhedron, like the photo.

Except now Mara saw the details: faint lines across its faces that resembled cracks in obsidian, except the cracks contained a dim, moving light.

Picard froze for half a heartbeat—his trained composure cracking under the weight of what he was seeing.

Vale inhaled sharply, a man beholding his own god.

Mara’s throat tightened.

Her curiosity—her great, beloved hunger—had been answered.

And the answer was terrifying.

Vale’s voice lowered, reverent. “You see? It’s real.”

Picard’s eyes hardened. “Close it,” he ordered Mara.

Mara’s hands trembled. “I don’t know how.”

Vale stepped forward.

Picard moved between them, weapon raised.

“Don’t,” Picard warned.

Vale’s smile returned, uglier now.

“You can’t shoot me,” Vale said. “Not here. Not with witnesses outside. Your Council is made of diplomacy. Diplomacy is slow.”

Picard’s jaw tightened.

Mara realized, with sudden clarity, that this was the kind of moment where history tipped—not with grand speeches, but with small human hesitations.

She looked at Picard.

And she understood something else too:

Picard didn’t want the Tox Uthat.

But he was willing to die to keep it out of the wrong hands.

That was a kind of courage Mara hadn’t known how to name.

Outside the room, alarms began to sound—soft at first, then escalating. The villa’s guests murmured, confused, drifting toward exits.

Vale’s eyes flicked toward the hallway.

He made a decision.

He grabbed the Tox Uthat.

Mara reacted without thinking—she grabbed it too.

Their fingers touched the device simultaneously.

For an instant, Mara felt heat—not thermal heat, but energetic impossibility. A sensation like standing too close to the heart of a machine that ran on laws of physics she didn’t know existed.

Vale yanked hard.

The foam tore.

The device slipped.

Picard lunged.

Everything happened at once: a struggle, a stumble, a flash of movement.

And then—

The Tox Uthat fell.

It hit the floor with a sound that wasn’t a sound, a soft pressure-wave that made Mara’s teeth ache.

The light along its seams brightened.

The room’s electronics flickered.

Somewhere far above them, in orbit, a satellite blinked.

Somewhere farther still, the Sun continued burning—ignorant, relentless.

But Mara suddenly knew, with sick certainty, that the Tox Uthat had **noticed** the star.

---

### 8. The Choice No One Trains You For

They ran.

Not elegantly now. Not politely.

Picard grabbed Mara’s wrist, and Mara didn’t fight him. Vale fled too, shouting into a comm unit, his security scrambling behind.

They burst through the villa into the night air, the sea wind slapping Mara’s face as if trying to wake her up.

Picard pulled her toward a car he’d staged nearby.

“Get in,” he snapped.

Mara’s mind spun. “Vale has it?”

Picard’s eyes flashed. “No.”

He opened his palm.

The Tox Uthat sat there, impossibly calm, as if the chaos had never touched it.

Mara stared.

“How—”

“I’m better at taking things than you are,” Picard said. Then, quieter: “And I’ve had longer to practice.”

They got into the car and tore down coastal roads, headlights carving the dark.

Behind them, another vehicle pursued—then two.

Picard drove with surgical focus.

Mara clutched the edge of her seat, staring at the device in Picard’s hand.

“What does it do?” she whispered. “Really?”

Picard didn’t look at her. “We think it manipulates quantum probabilities in the fusion chain. Not by cooling the star. Not by removing mass. By changing the likelihood of the reactions themselves—making the sun forget how to be a sun.”

Mara swallowed. “That’s impossible.”

Picard’s voice was flat. “And yet.”

Mara’s hands trembled.

If it could stop fusion, it could stop reactors.

It could end energy scarcity.

It could also collapse economies overnight, ignite wars, blackmail entire continents. It could kill a planet by killing its star slowly, leaving no dramatic explosion—just a dimming, a cooling, a long panic.

Mara’s voice cracked. “So what do we do? Take it to your Council?”

Picard glanced at her, his eyes reflecting dashboard lights like distant fires.

“The Council will secure it,” he said.

“And then?” Mara demanded. “They’ll hide it? Study it? Weaponize it?”

Picard’s hands tightened on the wheel. “I don’t know.”

Mara felt something shatter inside her—an old, private fantasy she’d carried for years: that knowledge was always good, that truth was always worth the cost.

“Someone sent it here,” she said. “Someone wanted this dilemma.”

“Yes,” Picard replied. “And someone is chasing us because they believe they can win it.”

The pursuing headlights grew closer.

Picard accelerated, took a turn onto a narrow road that cut through cliffs.

Mara looked down at the Tox Uthat again.

It sat in Picard’s hand like a silent verdict.

A thought rose in her mind, uninvited:

*What if no one gets it?*

She looked at Picard. “Can it be destroyed?”

Picard’s jaw tightened. “We don’t know.”

“Can it be lost?” she pressed. “Buried where no one can find it?”

Picard hesitated.

That hesitation told her everything: he’d considered it too.

“We’re near the old submarine trench,” Picard said. “Deep enough that retrieval is… unlikely.”

“Unlikely isn’t good enough,” Mara said.

Picard’s voice sharpened. “Mara. Listen to me. This is not a romantic sacrifice. This is a device that may—”

“—stop the Sun,” Mara finished, voice shaking. “I understand.”

Picard’s gaze flicked to her again.

In that look, Mara saw the weight he carried: duty, responsibility, the unbearable arithmetic of consequences.

And she saw something else too: the fact that he had been doing this so long that he’d forgotten what it felt like to want something for himself.

Mara inhaled.

“Give it to me,” she said.

Picard’s eyes narrowed. “No.”

“Give it to me,” she repeated. “You’re the agent. You’re the obvious target. They’ll follow you to the Council. They’ll compromise you. They’ll compromise them. They’ll compromise everyone.”

Picard’s voice went cold. “And what are you going to do?”

Mara swallowed hard.

“I’m going to steal it,” she said, “from all of you.”

Picard stared at her as if she’d slapped him.

Mara continued, rushing now before fear could reclaim her courage.

“You told me you need me alive,” she said. “Fine. Then let me *be* alive. Let me make the choice you can’t make because you’re trapped in your Council’s politics.”

Picard’s hands tightened on the wheel again.

The pursuing vehicle bumped them—light contact, a warning.

Mara cried out.

Picard swore, corrected, kept control.

Then, finally, he spoke with a kind of bitter honesty.

“If you take it,” he said, “I may have to hunt you.”

Mara’s throat tightened. “Then hunt me.”

Picard’s silence was not consent.

But it wasn’t refusal either.

He handed the Tox Uthat to Mara.

The moment her fingers wrapped around it, she felt again that strange mental pressure, like the device was measuring her.

Not judging.

Calculating.

Mara whispered, almost to herself: “I’m sorry.”

Picard’s eyes flashed. “For what?”

Mara didn’t answer.

Because she didn’t know whether she was sorry for betraying him—

—or sorry that she was about to do something she would never be celebrated for.

---

### 9. Into the Black Water

Mara jumped from the moving car.

Not onto asphalt—Picard had chosen the road with intent. Ahead, the cliffside broke toward a rocky slope leading down to a narrow beach where waves smashed white against black stone.

Mara rolled hard, pain flaring through her shoulder, sand and gravel tearing her skin.

The pursuing headlights overshot, braking too late.

Picard’s car continued, luring them forward.

Mara staggered upright, clutching the Tox Uthat to her chest as if it could hear her heartbeat.

She ran toward the water.

The ocean was cold enough to sting through clothing. The waves battered her like a reprimand.

Behind her, shouts—Vale’s people had spotted her.

Mara forced herself deeper.

Her lungs burned. The water rose to her waist, then her ribs, then her shoulders.

She looked once over her shoulder.

On the cliff above, Picard’s car had stopped sideways, blocking the road. Picard stood in the beam of his headlights like a lone figure in a stage play, weapon raised, holding back men who wanted the future for themselves.

He was buying her seconds.

Mara turned back to the sea.

She plunged under.

For a moment, sound became muffled thunder. The world shrank to dark water and the ache of her own body.

She swam, not gracefully, but fiercely. Each stroke pushed her toward a deeper black where the waves became heavy and the shore’s voices faded.

The Tox Uthat remained in her grip, inexplicably heavy now, as if it had decided to be difficult.

Mara kicked harder.

Her mind flashed with images: the Sun dimming, cities freezing, people praying to physics as if physics had ever cared.

Then another image:

A world powered cleanly, fusion tamed, hunger ended, conflict softened because energy was no longer something you killed for.

The device held both futures like a coin with two faces.

Mara reached a point where she could no longer see the bottom.

She let herself sink.

Saltwater pressed against her ears and eyes. Panic clawed at her.

Her body demanded air.

Her mind screamed to surface.

But Mara’s curiosity—her greatest gift and her greatest flaw—chose something else:

*What happens if I let go?*

She opened her hand.

The Tox Uthat drifted for half a second—

Then sank, fast, as if it had decided the deep belonged to it.

Mara watched it vanish into darkness.

Her lungs spasmed.

She kicked upward, desperate now, survival overriding philosophy. She broke the surface, gasping, coughing, choking on seawater.

The shore was chaos—voices, flashlights, movement.

A hand grabbed Mara’s arm from behind.

She whipped around, terror exploding—

Picard.

He hauled her toward a rock outcropping where they could hide from the lights sweeping the water.

They crouched, soaked and shaking.

Mara’s teeth chattered violently.

Picard’s face was hard with anger and something else she couldn’t immediately name.

“You did it,” he said.

Mara couldn’t tell if his tone meant accusation or disbelief.

“I had to,” she whispered.

Picard’s voice dropped to a low, fierce hiss. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done?”

Mara met his eyes, water streaming down her face like tears she hadn’t consented to.

“Yes,” she said. “I took it away from everyone who would misuse it.”

“And from everyone who might have used it to save lives,” Picard shot back.

Mara flinched.

That was the truth that hurt most.

She swallowed. “Then maybe I’m not a hero.”

Picard stared at her for a long moment.

Then his shoulders slumped slightly—not surrender, but exhaustion.

“No,” he said quietly. “You’re not.”

Mara’s throat tightened.

Picard continued, voice rough now, stripped of the agent’s polish.

“You’re what the Council forgets,” he said. “You’re a person who still believes choice matters, even when it costs you everything you wanted.”

Mara blinked hard.

Above them, Vale’s men shouted and argued, searching the shoreline, furious.

Picard took a breath, steadying himself.

“We have to move,” he said.

Mara nodded, numb.

As they slipped away along the rocks, Mara glanced back at the sea.

In her mind, she saw the Tox Uthat sinking into trenches so deep they might as well have been another world.

Unfound.

Unowned.

Sleeping.

But the feeling wouldn’t leave her—the faint pressure behind her eyes, the sense of being observed by something made of future science and ancient consequence.

As if the device wasn’t merely lost.

As if it had gone exactly where it wanted to go.

### Epilogue: The Cost of Curiosity

Weeks later, Mara sat alone in a small apartment far from Lisbon, in a city whose skyline she didn’t know well enough yet to love or hate.

Her face had appeared on feeds for a day, blurred and speculated about. Vale’s scandal had broken in quieter circles, then vanished under the weight of other news. The Planetary Intelligence Council issued denials in careful language.

No one announced the truth:

That a star-stopper had existed in human hands for a handful of minutes.

That a young lady with a vast curiosity had thrown it into the sea.

Picard visited once.

He did not arrive with handcuffs.

He did not arrive with praise.

He arrived with a silence that felt like a ledger.

They sat across from each other at her kitchen table. The room smelled like cheap tea and rain.

“I should arrest you,” Picard said finally.

Mara’s stomach tightened. “Will you?”

Picard watched her the way he’d watched rooms, entrances, shadows—except now he was watching the hardest thing: a human being who had done something unforgivable and possibly necessary.

“I can’t,” he said. “Not for this.”

Mara’s voice cracked. “Why not?”

Picard looked down at his hands, as if surprised to find them empty.

“Because I’m not sure you were wrong,” he admitted.

Mara stared at him.

“And because,” Picard added, “if the device was sent, then losing it may only be the first chapter.”

Mara swallowed. “You think it will come back.”

Picard’s eyes lifted to hers, steady and grim.

“I think,” he said, “that the future has discovered how to reach into the past.”

Mara’s skin prickled.

Picard stood.

At the door, he paused.

“You wanted adventure,” he said, not unkindly. “You have it.”

Mara’s laugh was small and broken. “I wanted fame too.”

Picard’s expression softened.

“Fame is a cheap reward,” he said. “Curiosity is expensive.”

Then he left.

Mara sat alone again, listening to rain against the window.

In the dark water somewhere—far beyond divers, far beyond sonar, far beyond the casual reach of human greed—something impossible waited.

And in Mara’s chest, the same weather system still turned.

Curiosity didn’t care about comfort.

Curiosity didn’t care about permission.

Curiosity cared about truth.

And Mara, who had once chased truth for wealth and status, now understood the deeper bargain:

Some truths don’t make you rich.

They make you responsible.

If you want, I can continue this as a longer novella with (1) a clearer origin for how the Tox Uthat arrived in our century, (2) a defined antagonist organization with internal politics, and (3) a second act where Mara and Picard realize the device *wants* a specific star—and that losing it was only step one.
