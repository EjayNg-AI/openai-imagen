## The Star-Stopper’s Lullaby

### Prologue: A Folktale With Teeth

They used to tell the story like a dare.

In certain corners of the net—forums with dim layouts and older moderators who spoke in careful sentences—people whispered about a device called the **Tox Uthat**. The name always looked wrong, like it had been translated twice and still didn’t sit correctly in the mouth.

A 26th-century machine, the posts claimed. A thing that could **stop nuclear fusion in a star**.

Not *explode* a star. Not *poison* it. Not trigger a supernova like the myths of science fiction liked to do, loud and theatrical.

Just… *stop it*.

Quench it. Snuff it, like pinching the flame of a candle between your fingers.

No one could agree on how the device arrived in this century, in this timeline. Some said a collapsed wormhole. Some said a time-delivery meant for someone else, misaddressed by a century and a hemisphere. Some said it fell out of a sky that wasn’t ours—a future that had tried to escape itself and shed its most dangerous secret like a snake shedding skin.

But all versions ended the same way:

If the Tox Uthat was real, it was the most valuable object on Earth and the most terrifying.

And it was loose.

### 1. The Young Lady Who Would Not Let It Go

Her name was **Mara Vance**, and she had the kind of curiosity that felt less like a trait and more like a weather system.

Curiosity made her take apart a radio at nine years old and put it back together with a leftover screw. Curiosity made her enroll in astrophysics and drop out halfway through, not because she couldn’t do the math, but because she couldn’t tolerate the slowness of permission: grant proposals, committee meetings, approvals to look at the sky as if the sky belonged to bureaucrats.

Curiosity made her work salvage instead—illegal-adjacent retrieval jobs, the kind that took her into flooded data centers after storms, down into collapsed subway arteries after tremors, or up to the carcasses of decommissioned orbital hardware that fell in pieces like tired meteors.

The world rewarded a certain kind of bravery with applause.

It rewarded Mara’s kind with *rumors*.

A month before everything changed, she was in **Lisbon**, sitting on the edge of a rooftop that overlooked the river, listening to a contact describe a crate that had never been on any manifest.

“Not government?” Mara asked.

“Not any government I can name,” the contact said. He kept his eyes on the skyline, as if the buildings might start confessing. “Not corporate, not military. It was… wrong.”

Wrong how?

“It didn’t look old. It didn’t look new. It looked like it didn’t have a time.”

Mara felt her pulse lean forward.

“Where is it now?”

The contact hesitated. That was the first tell, the smallest betrayal.

“Don’t,” he said. “I’m serious. Don’t. This is… folklore that bites.”

“Everything bites,” Mara replied. “Some things just have better teeth.”

He gave her a small, tired laugh—like he had once been young enough to believe curiosity was a virtue in itself.

Then he sent her a file.

No explanatory note. Just coordinates, a timestamp, and a single scanned image that made Mara sit up so sharply she nearly slid off the roof.

The image was a photograph of an object: a palm-sized polyhedron, matte-black, with edges that didn’t reflect light so much as refuse it. A thing with no obvious seams. No markings. No ports. It looked like the idea of a machine, stripped down to a pure geometric stubbornness.

Beneath the photo was a label—handwritten in a tight script that seemed almost embarrassed by the words.

**TOX UTHAT**

Mara stared until her eyes prickled.

A star-stopper.

A device so impossible it had become a bedtime story told to scientists who didn’t sleep anymore.

She whispered the name again, tasting it like a challenge.

“Tox Uthat.”

And then, without allowing herself time to feel how afraid she was, she began to pack.

Wealth. Fame. Adventure. Status.

But above all, the private thirst she rarely admitted out loud:

To know what was true.

### 2. Mr. Picard, Sent by the World

The first time Mara saw **Mr. Picard**, she did not know his name.

She only knew the posture: a man who looked like he had been trained to occupy rooms without asking permission. He was in the same underground bar in Lisbon, not sitting *with* anyone, but positioned so he could see every entrance and every shadowed corridor as if he’d mapped the place in his head the moment he stepped inside.

He was older than Mara by a couple decades—mid-forties, maybe. Neatly dressed in a way that didn’t invite attention but also didn’t apologize for itself. Not a rich man’s expensive suit; a professional’s durable uniform pretending not to be one.

Mara’s contact—the one who’d sent the file—spotted him too, and went pale in a way that had nothing to do with lighting.

“Who’s that?” Mara asked.

Her contact’s mouth opened, closed. He looked like he was about to lie and realized he couldn’t afford the effort.

“That,” he said quietly, “is the kind of person who makes people disappear politely.”

Mara’s interest sharpened.

The man glanced over, just once.

His eyes met hers like a hand resting briefly on a door handle, confirming its weight.

Then he looked away.

A second later, Mara’s contact stood up so abruptly his chair scraped the floor.

“I have to go,” he said.

Mara caught his wrist. “We had a deal.”

His skin felt cold.

“There are deals,” he whispered, “and then there’s survival.”

He leaned in until his breath brushed her ear.

“Whatever you’re chasing, you’re not the only one. And someone important has decided they don’t like the idea of amateurs holding it.”

He pulled free and disappeared into the press of bodies.

Mara turned back toward the older man.

He was gone too.

Only the sensation remained—that she had just stepped into a game whose rules she did not yet understand.

### 3. The Map That Wasn’t a Map

The coordinates led Mara to a storage facility outside the city, one of those modern warehouses that looked anonymous enough to hide anything, including the truth.

She broke in not with movie theatrics but with the simple competence of someone who’d done it before: spoof the lock signal, slip the camera loop, keep her heartbeat from making decisions.

Unit 19C contained a steel case, half-buried under obsolete telecom hardware.

The case had no brand name.

No shipping labels.

Only a symbol etched into the metal—a circle intersected by a line, like an eclipse cut by a horizon.

Mara’s fingers hovered above it.

She waited for the irrational part of her mind to scream *this is wrong.*

It didn’t scream.

It only leaned closer.

She opened the case.

Inside was not the device itself.

Inside was a **fragment**: a thin plate of dark material, lighter than it should be, warmer than the surrounding air, as if it carried its own thermal opinion. When she lifted it, she felt a faint vibration in her bones, a subtle pressure behind her eyes, like standing too close to a subwoofer you couldn’t hear.

The plate’s surface held patterns—microscopic ridges that looked almost decorative until her salvage-trained instincts recognized them as *structured information*, like the grooves of a record.

A data medium.

Or a key.

Her own equipment wouldn’t read it. Neither would most of what existed in civilian hands.

Which meant she needed help.

And help was dangerous, because help came with questions.

As Mara repacked the fragment, she heard the softest sound: a footstep in the corridor outside.

Then another.

Not hurried. Not uncertain. The kind of approach that assumed the world would accommodate it.

Mara closed the case and slid it back into its hiding place. She moved to the side wall, near a stack of fiber spools, and held her breath.

The unit door opened.

The light snapped on.

A man stepped in.

It was him.

The older one from the bar.

He did not search frantically. He did not call out. He simply stood still and looked around as if listening to the room’s shape.

“Mara Vance,” he said, pronouncing her name with calm accuracy.

Mara did not move.

“I’m not here to harm you,” he continued. “But you are trespassing in a situation you don’t understand.”

Mara’s hand tightened on the small cutting tool in her pocket.

“You’re following me,” she said.

“Yes.”

“Why?”

A pause. Then:

“Because you’re the most likely person to get yourself killed in the next forty-eight hours.”

Mara exhaled a bitter laugh. “That’s not much of an explanation.”

He turned his head slightly, looking directly toward where she hid, though she couldn’t tell if he truly saw her or had simply calculated the most probable position.

“My name is **Picard**,” he said. “I work for the **Planetary Intelligence Council**.”

Mara stepped out into the light.

“Planetary,” she repeated, tasting the word. “Like the planet has a single mind now?”

Picard’s expression tightened—not offended, but weighed down.

“Not a single mind. A negotiated one. A desperate one.”

He glanced toward the hidden case.

“You took something,” he said.

Mara lied with the confidence of practice. “I didn’t.”

Picard regarded her for a long moment.

Then he said something that rearranged the air in Mara’s lungs.

“The Tox Uthat,” he said quietly, “is not a story.”

Mara’s mouth went dry.

Picard continued. “And the people hunting it are not looking to get rich. They are looking to own a lever that can move nations by threatening the sky itself.”

Mara’s instincts screamed at her to run.

Her curiosity—the weather system inside her—insisted she stay.

“If it’s real,” Mara said, “it could change everything.”

“Yes,” Picard replied. “That’s why you cannot have it.”

Mara lifted her chin. “And why should *you*?”

Picard’s gaze didn’t harden; it softened, which was worse.

“I don’t want it,” he said. “I want it *unfound*.”

---

### 4. The Other Hunters

They left the storage facility together because staying would have been suicide. Picard didn’t order her. He simply made it clear, through the economy of his movements, that the hunters were already close enough to smell opportunity.

In the parking lot, Mara spotted them: three people crossing between rows of cars in loose formation, as if casually strolling. Their clothes were ordinary. Their faces were unremarkable.

But Mara had lived long enough among criminals to recognize the truth:

The best predators look like pedestrians.

Picard touched Mara’s elbow once—a brief guiding pressure—and they moved.

Not running.

Running would have admitted guilt and narrowed options.

They walked, turned a corner, and slipped between two delivery trucks. Picard keyed something on a device no larger than a coin, and one of the trucks’ doors unlocked with a soft click. They climbed inside, crouched behind pallets of packaged parts, and waited.

Mara’s heartbeat was loud in her throat.

“How did you—” she started.

Picard held up a finger.

Outside, footsteps approached. Voices murmured in a language Mara didn’t recognize.

Then a sound that made her blood go cold: a handheld scanner pinging softly, sweeping for electronics, heat signatures, maybe something else.

The footsteps paused near the truck.

Mara held her breath.

Picard’s calm did not waver, but she noticed his hand: he held it close to his side, ready, the way someone held a weapon without needing to show it.

The scanner passed. The voices receded.

Only when the sound faded into distance did Picard speak.

“They have resources,” he said. “They have patience. And they’ve been informed you exist.”

Mara swallowed. “By my contact.”

Picard’s silence confirmed it.

Mara’s anger flared hot. “So what, I’m bait?”

“No,” Picard said. “You’re a complication. And you’re also a human being, which matters more than you’re currently treating it.”

Mara stared at him, startled by the bluntness.

Picard met her gaze.

“You want wealth,” he said. “You want fame. But I’ve read your file. What you actually want is *meaning*. You want to touch a truth so big it changes you.”

Mara’s hands curled into fists. “Don’t pretend you know me.”

Picard’s voice lowered. “Then prove me wrong. Hand over what you took.”

Mara hesitated.

Because she had taken it.

Because she could feel the fragment’s faint warmth even through layers of cloth, like it was listening.

And because, for the first time, she realized that if she gave it up, she might never again be close to the answer that had haunted her since childhood: *what else is possible?*

“I can help,” she said instead. “You need me.”

Picard looked at her with something that might have been pity.

“I need you alive,” he said. “That’s not the same thing.”

---

### 5. The Language of the Future

They went to a place that wasn’t on any map Mara could access: a small, clean room beneath an unmarked building near the river, where the walls carried faint hums that suggested shielded electronics.

Picard didn’t hand her restraints or demand compliance. He offered her water. That, in its own way, was the most disarming tactic of all.

On a worktable sat instruments Mara recognized and others she didn’t. Spectrometers, microscopes, signal analyzers—and a sealed container with warning symbols written in three languages.

Picard nodded toward Mara’s bag. “The fragment.”

Mara took it out slowly, as if removing a wild animal from its cage.

When she placed it on the table, the room’s ambient hum shifted. A sensor on the wall flickered.

Picard’s eyes narrowed. “It’s active.”

“It’s doing something,” Mara whispered.

Picard brought a scanner over it. The screen filled with cascading nonsense—values that spiked, dropped, and stabilized in patterns that looked too elegant to be random.

“This isn’t an artifact,” Mara said. “It’s a *message*.”

Picard’s mouth tightened. “Or a beacon.”

Mara’s skin prickled.

Picard reached into a drawer and removed something that made Mara’s breath catch: a small object in a sealed pouch, similar material, similar wrongness.

“You have another piece,” she said.

Picard didn’t deny it.

“We recovered it six months ago,” he admitted. “From a private collection in Nuuk. The collector thought it was a sculpture.”

Mara stared. “And you couldn’t decode it.”

“We could not even agree on what it was,” Picard replied. “Until your fragment appeared.”

Mara leaned closer. Her mind moved fast, faster than fear.

“If two pieces resonate,” she murmured, “then they might be part of a larger system.”

Picard’s gaze sharpened. “And the larger system would be—”

“The Tox Uthat,” Mara finished.

The word hung between them like a blade.

Picard placed his fragment near hers.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then the air changed.

Not with sound, but with pressure—like the room inhaled. Mara felt the hair on her arms rise. The sensors on the wall lit in sequence, a ripple of nervous telemetry.

On the table, the two fragments vibrated gently, aligning themselves without physically moving, as if an invisible field corrected their relationship.

A line of light appeared—not emitted, but *revealed*, like the material had stopped hiding it.

Symbols bloomed across the surface.

Not letters.

Not numbers.

Something older and newer at once: a geometry of intention.

Mara’s mind, which had always been hungry, suddenly felt full—overfull—like someone had poured a new color into her brain.

She understood none of it consciously.

And yet, she knew what it was doing.

“It’s giving us coordinates,” she whispered.

Picard’s expression tightened. “Where?”

Mara’s fingers hovered over the projected pattern, tracing it as if her skin could translate.

“Not a place,” she said slowly. “A time… and a place.”

Picard’s jaw clenched.

Mara looked up at him.

“It didn’t fall into our century by accident,” she said. “It was *sent*.”

Picard’s voice was quiet. “Then whoever sent it may have wanted it found.”

Mara’s stomach sank.

“Or wanted it to be fought over,” she whispered.

---

### 6. The Auction of Dangerous Things

The coordinates led them to a location that made Mara laugh once, sharply, without humor.

“Of course,” she said. “An auction.”

Picard didn’t smile.

It wasn’t a public auction with paddles and champagne. It was a private exchange disguised as philanthropy, hosted in a coastal villa whose white walls gleamed like teeth.

Mara attended as someone else: hair pinned differently, lenses in her eyes, a dress that made her feel like she’d put on another person’s skin. Picard became a shadow in tailored clothing, his earpiece hidden, his movements precise.

“Remember,” he told her before they entered, “you do not improvise.”

Mara lifted an eyebrow. “Improvisation is half my skill set.”

“And it’s the half that gets you killed,” Picard replied.

Inside, the air smelled like money and saltwater. Men and women drifted through rooms filled with art that looked expensive and bored.

The lots were not displayed openly. Buyers were led, one at a time, into a back room where items appeared briefly—enough to confirm authenticity, not enough to invite theft.

Mara’s nerves buzzed. She could sense the predators here too, masked by elegance. People who had never held a gun but could order a war with a phone call.

Picard murmured in her earpiece. “Three o’clock. That man. Gray suit. That’s **Rossen Vale**.”

The name flicked something in Mara’s memory: Vale, the industrialist whose energy conglomerate had been implicated in sabotage of competing fusion startups.

“He’s one of the bad actors,” Mara whispered.

“Yes,” Picard said. “And he’s not the only one.”

Mara moved through the crowd, pretending interest in paintings while tracking conversations. Names surfaced like sharks’ fins: financiers, private military contractors, tech executives who spoke softly about “stability” and “leverage” as if those words weren’t synonyms for control.

Then Mara saw it.

Not the Tox Uthat itself.

But a case—black, matte, wrong in the same way the fragments were wrong.

Her breath caught.

The case was being carried by two security guards toward the back room.

Picard’s voice tightened. “Stay calm.”

Mara’s curiosity surged like a wave.

“That’s it,” she whispered. “It’s here.”

Picard said, very carefully, “Mara. You are not to approach.”

But Mara was already moving.

Not because she wanted to disobey.

Because something inside her—the same force that had driven her to dismantle radios and drop out of polite academia—could not bear the idea of being this close to a truth and letting it walk away.

She slipped behind a curtain into a corridor lined with closed doors.

Her heel barely clicked on the tile.

Ahead, the guards entered a room and closed the door behind them.

Mara waited two seconds, then reached for the handle.

It opened.

Inside, the lighting was dim and clinical. The case sat on a table. A woman in a fitted suit stood beside it, her expression professional, her eyes sharp.

And Rossen Vale was there too.

He turned at the sound of the door.

His gaze landed on Mara and widened slightly, as if recognizing her from some briefing file.

“Well,” Vale said softly, almost pleased. “The curiosity girl.”

Mara’s blood went cold.

The woman in the suit raised a small device—compact, black.

Not a gun.

Something worse.

Picard’s voice snapped in Mara’s ear. “Mara, get out—now.”

Too late.

The woman pressed the device.

Mara felt a sudden pressure in her skull, like an invisible fist. Her vision doubled. Her muscles hesitated. The room tilted.

A sonic or neural disruptor.

Vale stepped forward calmly, as if Mara were a chess piece he’d expected to capture.

“You’ve been very helpful,” he said. “Bringing the Council’s agent right to us.”

Mara fought to keep her feet. “You don’t know what you’re doing.”

Vale’s smile was thin.

“Oh,” he said, “I know exactly what I’m doing.”

He tapped the case.

“I’m buying the future.”

---

### 7. The Agent and the Thief

The door exploded inward.

Not with fire, but with a violent mechanical crack, as if the lock had been convinced it no longer had authority.

Picard entered like a storm that had learned manners.

He moved quickly, efficiently—disarming one guard with a twist of wrist and elbow, shoving the other into the wall hard enough to make him slide down. The woman with the disruptor lifted it again.

Picard fired a compact weapon Mara hadn’t seen—nonlethal, a pulse that made the woman convulse and drop.

Vale stumbled backward, more surprised than frightened.

Picard’s gaze locked onto him.

“Rossen Vale,” Picard said, voice level. “You’re under arrest on behalf of the Planetary Intelligence Council.”

Vale laughed once.

“You don’t have a planet,” he said. “You have a negotiation.”

His hand snapped toward the case.

Mara, still dizzy, acted on instinct.

She lunged—not toward Vale, but toward the case.

Her fingers touched the matte surface—

—and the world changed.

For a split second, Mara saw *something else*: not the room, not the villa, but a field of stars with a dark seam running through them, like a rip in fabric. A sense of immense distance, immense time, and a cold intelligence that did not feel human.

Then her vision snapped back.

The case clicked open by itself, as if recognizing her touch.

Inside lay the device.

The **Tox Uthat** was smaller than Mara expected. Not a massive machine, not a weapon with barrels or blades, but a compact shape nested in foam that seemed more ceremonial than protective.

A polyhedron, like the photo.

Except now Mara saw the details: faint lines across its faces that resembled cracks in obsidian, except the cracks contained a dim, moving light.

Picard froze for half a heartbeat—his trained composure cracking under the weight of what he was seeing.

Vale inhaled sharply, a man beholding his own god.

Mara’s throat tightened.

Her curiosity—her great, beloved hunger—had been answered.

And the answer was terrifying.

Vale’s voice lowered, reverent. “You see? It’s real.”

Picard’s eyes hardened. “Close it,” he ordered Mara.

Mara’s hands trembled. “I don’t know how.”

Vale stepped forward.

Picard moved between them, weapon raised.

“Don’t,” Picard warned.

Vale’s smile returned, uglier now.

“You can’t shoot me,” Vale said. “Not here. Not with witnesses outside. Your Council is made of diplomacy. Diplomacy is slow.”

Picard’s jaw tightened.

Mara realized, with sudden clarity, that this was the kind of moment where history tipped—not with grand speeches, but with small human hesitations.

She looked at Picard.

And she understood something else too:

Picard didn’t want the Tox Uthat.

But he was willing to die to keep it out of the wrong hands.

That was a kind of courage Mara hadn’t known how to name.

Outside the room, alarms began to sound—soft at first, then escalating. The villa’s guests murmured, confused, drifting toward exits.

Vale’s eyes flicked toward the hallway.

He made a decision.

He grabbed the Tox Uthat.

Mara reacted without thinking—she grabbed it too.

Their fingers touched the device simultaneously.

For an instant, Mara felt heat—not thermal heat, but energetic impossibility. A sensation like standing too close to the heart of a machine that ran on laws of physics she didn’t know existed.

Vale yanked hard.

The foam tore.

The device slipped.

Picard lunged.

Everything happened at once: a struggle, a stumble, a flash of movement.

And then—

The Tox Uthat fell.

It hit the floor with a sound that wasn’t a sound, a soft pressure-wave that made Mara’s teeth ache.

The light along its seams brightened.

The room’s electronics flickered.

Somewhere far above them, in orbit, a satellite blinked.

Somewhere farther still, the Sun continued burning—ignorant, relentless.

But Mara suddenly knew, with sick certainty, that the Tox Uthat had **noticed** the star.

---

### 8. The Choice No One Trains You For

They ran.

Not elegantly now. Not politely.

Picard grabbed Mara’s wrist, and Mara didn’t fight him. Vale fled too, shouting into a comm unit, his security scrambling behind.

They burst through the villa into the night air, the sea wind slapping Mara’s face as if trying to wake her up.

Picard pulled her toward a car he’d staged nearby.

“Get in,” he snapped.

Mara’s mind spun. “Vale has it?”

Picard’s eyes flashed. “No.”

He opened his palm.

The Tox Uthat sat there, impossibly calm, as if the chaos had never touched it.

Mara stared.

“How—”

“I’m better at taking things than you are,” Picard said. Then, quieter: “And I’ve had longer to practice.”

They got into the car and tore down coastal roads, headlights carving the dark.

Behind them, another vehicle pursued—then two.

Picard drove with surgical focus.

Mara clutched the edge of her seat, staring at the device in Picard’s hand.

“What does it do?” she whispered. “Really?”

Picard didn’t look at her. “We think it manipulates quantum probabilities in the fusion chain. Not by cooling the star. Not by removing mass. By changing the likelihood of the reactions themselves—making the sun forget how to be a sun.”

Mara swallowed. “That’s impossible.”

Picard’s voice was flat. “And yet.”

Mara’s hands trembled.

If it could stop fusion, it could stop reactors.

It could end energy scarcity.

It could also collapse economies overnight, ignite wars, blackmail entire continents. It could kill a planet by killing its star slowly, leaving no dramatic explosion—just a dimming, a cooling, a long panic.

Mara’s voice cracked. “So what do we do? Take it to your Council?”

Picard glanced at her, his eyes reflecting dashboard lights like distant fires.

“The Council will secure it,” he said.

“And then?” Mara demanded. “They’ll hide it? Study it? Weaponize it?”

Picard’s hands tightened on the wheel. “I don’t know.”

Mara felt something shatter inside her—an old, private fantasy she’d carried for years: that knowledge was always good, that truth was always worth the cost.

“Someone sent it here,” she said. “Someone wanted this dilemma.”

“Yes,” Picard replied. “And someone is chasing us because they believe they can win it.”

The pursuing headlights grew closer.

Picard accelerated, took a turn onto a narrow road that cut through cliffs.

Mara looked down at the Tox Uthat again.

It sat in Picard’s hand like a silent verdict.

A thought rose in her mind, uninvited:

*What if no one gets it?*

She looked at Picard. “Can it be destroyed?”

Picard’s jaw tightened. “We don’t know.”

“Can it be lost?” she pressed. “Buried where no one can find it?”

Picard hesitated.

That hesitation told her everything: he’d considered it too.

“We’re near the old submarine trench,” Picard said. “Deep enough that retrieval is… unlikely.”

“Unlikely isn’t good enough,” Mara said.

Picard’s voice sharpened. “Mara. Listen to me. This is not a romantic sacrifice. This is a device that may—”

“—stop the Sun,” Mara finished, voice shaking. “I understand.”

Picard’s gaze flicked to her again.

In that look, Mara saw the weight he carried: duty, responsibility, the unbearable arithmetic of consequences.

And she saw something else too: the fact that he had been doing this so long that he’d forgotten what it felt like to want something for himself.

Mara inhaled.

“Give it to me,” she said.

Picard’s eyes narrowed. “No.”

“Give it to me,” she repeated. “You’re the agent. You’re the obvious target. They’ll follow you to the Council. They’ll compromise you. They’ll compromise them. They’ll compromise everyone.”

Picard’s voice went cold. “And what are you going to do?”

Mara swallowed hard.

“I’m going to steal it,” she said, “from all of you.”

Picard stared at her as if she’d slapped him.

Mara continued, rushing now before fear could reclaim her courage.

“You told me you need me alive,” she said. “Fine. Then let me *be* alive. Let me make the choice you can’t make because you’re trapped in your Council’s politics.”

Picard’s hands tightened on the wheel again.

The pursuing vehicle bumped them—light contact, a warning.

Mara cried out.

Picard swore, corrected, kept control.

Then, finally, he spoke with a kind of bitter honesty.

“If you take it,” he said, “I may have to hunt you.”

Mara’s throat tightened. “Then hunt me.”

Picard’s silence was not consent.

But it wasn’t refusal either.

He handed the Tox Uthat to Mara.

The moment her fingers wrapped around it, she felt again that strange mental pressure, like the device was measuring her.

Not judging.

Calculating.

Mara whispered, almost to herself: “I’m sorry.”

Picard’s eyes flashed. “For what?”

Mara didn’t answer.

Because she didn’t know whether she was sorry for betraying him—

—or sorry that she was about to do something she would never be celebrated for.

---

### 9. Into the Black Water

Mara jumped from the moving car.

Not onto asphalt—Picard had chosen the road with intent. Ahead, the cliffside broke toward a rocky slope leading down to a narrow beach where waves smashed white against black stone.

Mara rolled hard, pain flaring through her shoulder, sand and gravel tearing her skin.

The pursuing headlights overshot, braking too late.

Picard’s car continued, luring them forward.

Mara staggered upright, clutching the Tox Uthat to her chest as if it could hear her heartbeat.

She ran toward the water.

The ocean was cold enough to sting through clothing. The waves battered her like a reprimand.

Behind her, shouts—Vale’s people had spotted her.

Mara forced herself deeper.

Her lungs burned. The water rose to her waist, then her ribs, then her shoulders.

She looked once over her shoulder.

On the cliff above, Picard’s car had stopped sideways, blocking the road. Picard stood in the beam of his headlights like a lone figure in a stage play, weapon raised, holding back men who wanted the future for themselves.

He was buying her seconds.

Mara turned back to the sea.

She plunged under.

For a moment, sound became muffled thunder. The world shrank to dark water and the ache of her own body.

She swam, not gracefully, but fiercely. Each stroke pushed her toward a deeper black where the waves became heavy and the shore’s voices faded.

The Tox Uthat remained in her grip, inexplicably heavy now, as if it had decided to be difficult.

Mara kicked harder.

Her mind flashed with images: the Sun dimming, cities freezing, people praying to physics as if physics had ever cared.

Then another image:

A world powered cleanly, fusion tamed, hunger ended, conflict softened because energy was no longer something you killed for.

The device held both futures like a coin with two faces.

Mara reached a point where she could no longer see the bottom.

She let herself sink.

Saltwater pressed against her ears and eyes. Panic clawed at her.

Her body demanded air.

Her mind screamed to surface.

But Mara’s curiosity—her greatest gift and her greatest flaw—chose something else:

*What happens if I let go?*

She opened her hand.

The Tox Uthat drifted for half a second—

Then sank, fast, as if it had decided the deep belonged to it.

Mara watched it vanish into darkness.

Her lungs spasmed.

She kicked upward, desperate now, survival overriding philosophy. She broke the surface, gasping, coughing, choking on seawater.

The shore was chaos—voices, flashlights, movement.

A hand grabbed Mara’s arm from behind.

She whipped around, terror exploding—

Picard.

He hauled her toward a rock outcropping where they could hide from the lights sweeping the water.

They crouched, soaked and shaking.

Mara’s teeth chattered violently.

Picard’s face was hard with anger and something else she couldn’t immediately name.

“You did it,” he said.

Mara couldn’t tell if his tone meant accusation or disbelief.

“I had to,” she whispered.

Picard’s voice dropped to a low, fierce hiss. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done?”

Mara met his eyes, water streaming down her face like tears she hadn’t consented to.

“Yes,” she said. “I took it away from everyone who would misuse it.”

“And from everyone who might have used it to save lives,” Picard shot back.

Mara flinched.

That was the truth that hurt most.

She swallowed. “Then maybe I’m not a hero.”

Picard stared at her for a long moment.

Then his shoulders slumped slightly—not surrender, but exhaustion.

“No,” he said quietly. “You’re not.”

Mara’s throat tightened.

Picard continued, voice rough now, stripped of the agent’s polish.

“You’re what the Council forgets,” he said. “You’re a person who still believes choice matters, even when it costs you everything you wanted.”

Mara blinked hard.

Above them, Vale’s men shouted and argued, searching the shoreline, furious.

Picard took a breath, steadying himself.

“We have to move,” he said.

Mara nodded, numb.

As they slipped away along the rocks, Mara glanced back at the sea.

In her mind, she saw the Tox Uthat sinking into trenches so deep they might as well have been another world.

Unfound.

Unowned.

Sleeping.

But the feeling wouldn’t leave her—the faint pressure behind her eyes, the sense of being observed by something made of future science and ancient consequence.

As if the device wasn’t merely lost.

As if it had gone exactly where it wanted to go.

### Epilogue: The Cost of Curiosity

Weeks later, Mara sat alone in a small apartment far from Lisbon, in a city whose skyline she didn’t know well enough yet to love or hate.

Her face had appeared on feeds for a day, blurred and speculated about. Vale’s scandal had broken in quieter circles, then vanished under the weight of other news. The Planetary Intelligence Council issued denials in careful language.

No one announced the truth:

That a star-stopper had existed in human hands for a handful of minutes.

That a young lady with a vast curiosity had thrown it into the sea.

Picard visited once.

He did not arrive with handcuffs.

He did not arrive with praise.

He arrived with a silence that felt like a ledger.

They sat across from each other at her kitchen table. The room smelled like cheap tea and rain.

“I should arrest you,” Picard said finally.

Mara’s stomach tightened. “Will you?”

Picard watched her the way he’d watched rooms, entrances, shadows—except now he was watching the hardest thing: a human being who had done something unforgivable and possibly necessary.

“I can’t,” he said. “Not for this.”

Mara’s voice cracked. “Why not?”

Picard looked down at his hands, as if surprised to find them empty.

“Because I’m not sure you were wrong,” he admitted.

Mara stared at him.

“And because,” Picard added, “if the device was sent, then losing it may only be the first chapter.”

Mara swallowed. “You think it will come back.”

Picard’s eyes lifted to hers, steady and grim.

“I think,” he said, “that the future has discovered how to reach into the past.”

Mara’s skin prickled.

Picard stood.

At the door, he paused.

“You wanted adventure,” he said, not unkindly. “You have it.”

Mara’s laugh was small and broken. “I wanted fame too.”

Picard’s expression softened.

“Fame is a cheap reward,” he said. “Curiosity is expensive.”

Then he left.

Mara sat alone again, listening to rain against the window.

In the dark water somewhere—far beyond divers, far beyond sonar, far beyond the casual reach of human greed—something impossible waited.

And in Mara’s chest, the same weather system still turned.

Curiosity didn’t care about comfort.

Curiosity didn’t care about permission.

Curiosity cared about truth.

And Mara, who had once chased truth for wealth and status, now understood the deeper bargain:

Some truths don’t make you rich.

They make you responsible.

---

If you want, I can continue this as a longer novella with (1) a clearer origin for how the Tox Uthat arrived in our century, (2) a defined antagonist organization with internal politics, and (3) a second act where Mara and Picard realize the device *wants* a specific star—and that losing it was only step one.

---

The Borrower hummed to life the way Orison did at every dawn cycle: not loudly, not urgently, but with the patient insistence of something that had learned how to share air.

A low vibration rose through the floor plates and into my knees. The display panel on the device—tucked politely behind a carved-wood screen as if it were ashamed of being new in an old room—brightened from charcoal to a soft library-amber. On the far side of the glass, the rotating gardens whispered in their slow mechanical way: irrigation lines ticking, trellises giving and taking a millimeter as centrifugal “down” persuaded every vine to keep believing.

Warm recycled air drifted from the vent above my desk. It carried the faint sweetness of algae broth and citrus peel from the cafés along the promenade. Orison’s designers had insisted on warmth, on smells, on tiny sensory proofs that you were not alone in a sealed world. Loneliness, they said, was a pressure differential like any other. You didn’t eliminate it; you managed it so it didn’t blow out the hull.

I ran my fingertips along the Borrower’s seam line, feeling for heat irregularities the way my own mentors had felt for hairline cracks in tape housings back when archives were spools and not clouds. I was a systems archivist by title and temperament: paid to mistrust anything that claimed to be permanent, trained to love the quiet disciplines of redundancy, checksum, and decay.

This machine was the opposite of everything I’d been taught to preserve.

One memory. One moment. Pulled—if you believed the physicists and the lawmakers and the poets who had forced them to share a committee room—from the future.

Not a prophecy. Not a timeline. Not a list of outcomes.

A borrowed tomorrow that would someday be paid back by living long enough to remember it as real.

On my wrist, my own console chimed: **CIVIC EXPERIMENT / LIBRARY OF BORROWED TOMORROWS / SESSION READY. OPERATOR: VENN, ARI.**

I exhaled through my nose, tasting the station’s old air on my tongue. I’d been assigned to the experiment because the council trusted archivists with impossibilities. We were the ones who knew that any record, no matter how holy, could be weaponized if you handled it without care.

Tonight’s borrower was a diplomat.

The notification had arrived three days ago with the kind of polite urgency that never bothered to pretend it wasn’t a command.

**VISITING SIGNATORY REQUESTS ACCESS PRIOR TO TREATY RATIFICATION. CONSENT PROVIDED.**

Somewhere in the habitat’s inner ring, security staff would be shifting their weight and checking their cuffs. Somewhere, negotiators would be sipping tea and pretending not to watch the clocks.

Here, in the library—real paper shelves lining the curved walls, the scent of cellulose cultivated like a garden crop—the Borrower waited in its glass booth like a reserved reading room for a book you weren’t sure you wanted to read.

A soft knock came from the corridor.

“Come in,” I called, and immediately regretted how small my voice sounded in a room designed to swallow echoes.

The door slid aside with a sigh. The diplomat stepped in, carrying the careful stillness of someone used to rooms full of people trying to read her face.

She was younger than I’d expected—mid-forties maybe, though in orbit that didn’t mean much. Her hair was pinned back in a severe twist, but the pin itself was carved from bone or imitation bone, warm-colored, almost domestic. Her jacket bore no insignia. Only a thin band of woven thread around her wrist, the kind you wore after a wedding or a funeral or a promise you didn’t want to talk about.

“Archivist Venn,” she said.

“Ambassador Naran,” I replied, because I’d memorized the briefing like it was scripture: **SAFIYA NARAN. ENVOY PLENIPOTENTIARY.** If you were going to handle someone’s possible future, you started by treating their present with respect.

She glanced past me at the glass booth. The Borrower’s amber light threw soft geometry onto her cheekbones.

“It’s real,” she said, not quite a question.

“It’s on,” I corrected gently. “Reality is… a longer argument.”

A corner of her mouth lifted. It wasn’t a smile; it was the brief acknowledgment that I was speaking her language: caution wrapped in civility.

She inhaled. The warm air made her shoulders loosen by a fraction. Orison did that to people. The habitat didn’t try to impress you with scale or speed. It impressed you with small mercies: the way the handrails were always just slightly warmer than the corridor, as if someone had passed moments ago; the way the public screens ran not only news but neighbor-made art and recorded lullabies; the way the lighting shifted slowly enough that your body could believe in dawn even when the sun was just a schedule.

I gestured to the table beside my desk, where a pot of steeped leaf tea waited under a thermal dome.

“Before we begin,” I said, “do you want something warm? It helps some people stay anchored.”

Her gaze flicked to the pot, then back to the booth.

“Tea,” she agreed, like she was signing a minor treaty.

I poured two cups. The tea was made from station-grown mint and something citrusy that never tasted like any Earth fruit I’d ever had—Orison’s gardens produced their own species of comfort, cultivated over generations of careful loneliness.

We sat. The table between us held the Borrower’s forms, though “forms” was the wrong word for documents that had been argued over in committees for ten years and carved into law as if by chisel.

**TEMPORAL RETRIEVAL CONSENT: PRESENT SELF.**

**TEMPORAL RETRIEVAL CONSENT: FUTURE SELF (ESTIMATED).**

**NON-ADVANTAGEOUS USE AFFIRMATION.**

**THIRD-PARTY PRIVACY ACKNOWLEDGMENT.**

Ambassador Naran looked at the stack like it might bite.

“You’re really an archivist,” she said.

“I really am.”

“I expected… a clinician.”

“We have one on standby,” I said. “But the council decided the Borrower belonged in the library, not the hospital.”

“Why?”

“Because people treat hospitals like places where you surrender control,” I said. “And they wanted this to feel like borrowing a book. Voluntary. Finite. Returnable.”

She wrapped her hands around the cup, letting the heat soak into her palms.

“And you think it is returnable,” she said.

I watched the steam curl.

“I think,” I said carefully, “that if you borrow a memory from your own future, you live under the obligation to make it true. Or you spend the rest of your life wondering what you stole.”

Her eyes narrowed, not with suspicion, but with the kind of attention diplomats use when they’re trying to detect whether they’re being handed ideology disguised as procedure.

“There’s your evidence question,” she murmured.

I nodded. “Yes.”

For a few seconds we listened to the habitat: distant footsteps, a far-off laugh softened by insulation, the faint mechanical hush of the gardens turning.

“Archivist,” she said at last, “I’m not here to ask the machine if the treaty will succeed.”

“Good,” I said. “Because it won’t answer you.”

“It’s just a memory,” she continued. “A moment.”

“Yes.”

“But moments contain… information,” she said. “A face. A room. A phrase that tells you who stood where.”

“They do,” I agreed.

“And yet you’re letting me do this,” she said. “Before I sign.”

Her grip tightened around the cup. Her knuckles went pale. The severe twist of her hair suddenly seemed less like authority and more like someone holding themselves together.

I’d read the background. I knew the conflicts that had sharpened her. I knew the treaty she was supposed to sign would redistribute docking rights, water allotments, and jurisdiction over the orbitals that kept both her people and her rivals alive.

But I didn’t know what she felt when she closed her eyes at night.

Orison taught you not to assume you knew what anyone felt. Here, loneliness was common enough that you didn’t treat it like a flaw. You treated it like weather.

“Tell me why,” I said. “In your words.”

She looked down at her tea, as if it might offer an interpretation.

“I’ve negotiated this text into exhaustion,” she said softly. “We’ve argued clauses until the language has no sharp edges left. It’s… fair. It’s cautious. It is, as my advisors keep saying, ‘structurally peace-compatible.’”

“And you don’t believe it.”

“I believe it the way you believe a diagram,” she said. “I can trace the lines. I can show you where the forces balance. But my body doesn’t believe it. My body still expects the other side to turn a harmless word into a weapon.”

She lifted her gaze to mine.

“I don’t want advantage,” she said, and there was something almost fierce in it. “I want emotional plausibility. I want to know if peace can become… not just thinkable. Believable. In the nervous system.”

Warm air moved across my face. In it I could almost taste the truth of what she was saying: that treaties were not merely legal structures, but stories a population tried to tell their bodies until their bodies stopped flinching.

“You want evidence,” I said, “but not of outcomes.”

“Yes.”

“Evidence of capacity,” I said.

She nodded once.

I glanced at the forms, then at the Borrower’s booth. The amber light pulsed in a rhythm tuned to mimic a resting heart.

“The law,” I said, “calls this ‘civic solace.’”

She made a small sound that might have been laughter if she’d let it.

“The law can call it whatever it wants,” she said. “I need to sign without feeling like I’m lying.”

I let that sit between us.

Outside the library’s glass, the garden ring rotated. Leaves trembled, not from wind but from the steady insistence of artificial gravity. Plants didn’t know they lived on a wheel; they just knew down and light and water. They grew anyway.

“I can do this for you,” I said. “But you have to understand what you’re buying.”

“I’m not buying,” she said, reflexive.

“Borrowing,” I corrected.

Her expression softened, as if she appreciated that I’d taken the metaphor seriously.

“What am I borrowing, really?” she asked.

“A future sensation,” I said. “A memory that your future self will someday have—the embodied trace of a real moment. The machine doesn’t look forward like a telescope. It resonates backward with a pattern your mind will someday form and lets you feel it now.”

“And if I change my mind,” she said. “If I decide not to live that moment. If I decide not to sign. If I decide to resign, or—”

“Then the borrowed thing becomes a wound,” I said. “Or a ghost.”

She stared at her tea until the steam thinned.

“Consent,” she said at last. “Let’s talk about consent.”

That was the heart of it. Every committee, every philosophical essay, every argument that had dragged my profession into a war with itself—because archivists loved consent the way we loved provenance. Without it, a record was theft.

“The Borrower requires your present consent,” I said. “You sign. You sit. You choose. That’s the obvious part.”

“And the future self?” she asked.

I took a breath.

“Legally,” I said, “the future self is not a separate person. The law treats you as continuous.”

“And ethically?”

“Ethically,” I said, “the future self is a stakeholder. The person who will live that memory has interests. Privacy. Integrity. Freedom from coercion by their own past.”

Her eyes sharpened again.

“So why is it allowed.”

“Because,” I said, “we allow people to make decisions that bind their future selves all the time. Oaths. Marriage. Parenthood. Military service. Signing a treaty.”

She flinched, almost imperceptibly, at that last one. I hadn’t meant it as a jab, but truth had edges.

“The difference,” I continued, “is that with those things, the future self knows the terms. Here, the future self can’t object in advance.”

“And yet you claim they consent,” she said.

I nodded toward the Borrower.

“The machine doesn’t retrieve just any moment,” I said. “It retrieves one that your future self actually forms as a memory. If your future self never experiences it, there’s nothing to retrieve. If your future self experiences it but would have refused to share it—”

“It can refuse?” she asked.

“In theory,” I said. “The resonance weakens. The Borrower fails. We call it a ‘closed stack.’ A memory the library can’t circulate.”

She stared at the booth again, as if imagining a future version of herself shelving certain moments out of reach.

“And in practice?” she asked.

“In practice,” I admitted, “we’ve had sessions fail. We’ve had people request a memory of being forgiven and find that their future doesn’t hold it.”

Her fingers tightened on the cup again.

“That’s cruel.”

“It can be,” I said. “But it’s also honest. We do not promise comfort. We promise access, under constraints.”

“Constraints,” she repeated, and now there was the diplomat’s instinct for loopholes.

I slid the third-party privacy form closer to her.

“Most of the constraints exist because your memory is not just yours,” I said. “Even in the future. It will contain other people. Their faces. Their words. Their bodies. And they did not consent to have their presence used as evidence now.”

“So you blur them,” she said, reading ahead.

“Yes,” I said. “The Borrower delivers the memory in a way that preserves affect and embodiment but scrubs identifying details that could be exploited. Names. Faces. Readable text. Coordinates.”

“And if I’m remembering someone I already know,” she said.

“Then you’ll still know them,” I said. “But the machine tries not to give you new identities you don’t already have.”

She looked up. “Tries.”

“Tries,” I echoed.

The hum of the Borrower deepened, as if it were listening.

Ambassador Naran set down her cup.

“Hope,” she said. “If I feel peace tonight—if I feel myself in some future garden, laughing with someone I am supposed to hate—then what is hope afterward? Is it still hope, or is it… a memory debt.”

The phrase landed in me like a heavy book dropped on a table.

A memory debt. Yes.

I thought of Orison’s quiet technologies: the corridor lights that brightened when someone was nearby so you never had to wonder if you were the only awake soul in a whole cylinder; the communal audio channels where strangers read poetry into the air so that even in your apartment you could hear a human voice; the way the gardens were open at all hours, because plants didn’t care what you were and wouldn’t ask you to explain your sadness.

All of it was built on the idea that loneliness didn’t need to be cured. It needed to be held.

Maybe hope was the same.

“Hope,” I said slowly, “isn’t less because you’ve felt it. But it changes. It stops being an abstract yearning and becomes a responsibility.”

“To whom,” she asked, “my future self?”

“To your present self,” I said. “To the people you serve. To the person you might become.”

She leaned back, eyes on the ceiling where a mural of old Earth constellations had been painted by schoolchildren generations ago. The constellations were wrong in orbit. Orison’s sky was curated: a dome of light and story rather than stars.

“I don’t know which memory to ask for,” she admitted.

That, too, was in the forms: **MEMORY QUERY SELECTION. OPERATOR ASSISTANCE REQUIRED.** The law demanded an operator not to choose for the subject, but to help them choose without harming themselves or others. A librarian of tomorrows, guiding a borrower away from the shelf that would cut their hands.

“We start with boundaries,” I said. “What do you not want.”

She blinked, then looked at me as if startled by how practical the question was.

“I don’t want…” She hesitated. “I don’t want the signing.”

“Good,” I said. “Too full of exploitable details.”

“I don’t want to see anyone die,” she said quickly, as if afraid the machine might offer it.

“You can request a non-traumatic memory,” I said. “The Borrower will not circulate severe harm if it can avoid it. But it cannot promise your future contains no pain.”

Her jaw tightened. “I know.”

“And you don’t want a negotiation moment,” I continued.

“No,” she said. “That would contaminate everything.”

“Then we look for something that would make peace emotionally believable,” I said. “What would that look like, in your body.”

She closed her eyes, and for a moment I saw the exhausted human behind the diplomat.

“Silence,” she whispered. “Being near them and not having my mind run tactical simulations. Not tracking exits. Not listening for the slight change in voice that means they’re lying.”

“Okay,” I said. “A low-vigilance state in the presence of an outgroup.”

She opened one eye.

“You just made me into a research paper.”

I let myself smile. “Occupational hazard.”

That earned me the first real curve of her mouth.

“Continue,” she said.

“Do you want it to be on Orison?” I asked. “Or elsewhere.”

She glanced again at the garden ring beyond the library. Leaves turned their slow circles. Somewhere out there, people were eating dinner, falling in love, arguing about maintenance schedules, worrying about their children, watching old entertainment feeds. Ordinary life on a wheel.

“If peace is possible,” she said, “it will have to include places like this. Neutral spaces. Shared air.”

“Then Orison,” I said.

“Orison,” she agreed.

“Do you want it to involve the other signatory,” I asked, “or just their people.”

Her hands went still.

“The other signatory,” she said. “Not because I want to know them. Because if I can feel safe with *them*, then perhaps… perhaps the treaty isn’t just paper.”

I nodded.

We both knew the other signatory by rumor and briefings: Director Isem Kade, the hawk who had risen on a platform of never yielding orbital control, whose speeches were full of tight smiles and metaphors about predators. The kind of person you expected to weaponize anything.

The kind of person you wanted to prove wrong by surviving them.

“All right,” I said. “But we have to phrase it carefully.”

I tapped the console and brought up the query interface. It wasn’t a keyboard. The Borrower didn’t understand words. It understood patterns: sensory tags, affective vectors, embodied signatures. It was a machine built to negotiate with a mind.

The interface displayed a set of sliders and anchors:

**SETTING:** neutral / home / contested  
**SOCIAL CONTEXT:** alone / with known / with unknown / with adversary  
**AFFECT:** calm / joy / grief / relief / tenderness  
**INFORMATION RISK:** low / moderate / high  
**TRAUMA RISK:** low / moderate / high  
**ANONYMIZATION:** standard / strict / minimal

Ambassador Naran watched as if she were seeing the inside of her own skull rendered into bureaucracy.

“What does anonymization do to the memory?” she asked.

“It makes it less like spying,” I said. “More like… feeling.”

“And if I ask for minimal,” she said.

“You risk seeing faces and names you don’t yet know,” I said. “You risk gaining an advantage you didn’t intend. You risk turning a moment of peace into a tactical asset.”

She stared at the sliders.

“I don’t want that,” she said. “But if it’s too blurred—if I can’t see who I’m with—then it won’t convince me.”

“There’s a middle path,” I said. “Standard anonymization. You’ll know it’s someone. You’ll feel their presence. You might not get a clear face.”

“And if my future self knows their face,” she said, “won’t my present self recognize it anyway?”

I hesitated. This was one of the questions the committees had never resolved to everyone’s satisfaction.

“Recognition is not binary,” I said. “Your mind has layers. The Borrower tries to deliver a memory through layers that preserve affect while limiting exploitable detail. You may recognize the person the way you recognize a voice through a wall. Enough to know it’s them. Not enough to build a plan.”

She considered that, and I could see the diplomat weighing not only ethics but practicality. She had spent her life turning partial information into decisions. Asking her to accept partial information without exploiting it was like asking a knife not to cut.

“Standard,” she said finally. “And… low trauma risk.”

I adjusted the sliders accordingly.

“Now the core of the query,” I said. “We need something specific enough that the Borrower can find a matching engram, but not so specific that it becomes a question.”

She took a breath. Her voice was steadier now, as if the act of choosing had given her back a sliver of agency.

“I want,” she said, “a moment after the treaty is signed—far enough after that it isn’t ceremony. A moment where I am with Director Kade—” she swallowed, “—and I am not afraid of them. Not because I’m armed. Not because security is watching. Because I *trust*.”

Trust. Dangerous word.

“I would adjust one thing,” I said.

Her brow lifted. “Yes?”

“Don’t request trust,” I said. “Request what trust feels like.”

She let out a breath that might have been amusement or frustration.

“Fine,” she said. “I want… warmth. I want my shoulders to drop. I want to laugh without checking if it’s safe. I want to eat something in their presence.”

“Food is good,” I said. “Food is embodied. Food is hard to weaponize.”

She gave me a look that said: *You have never met a diplomat who couldn’t weaponize bread.*

But she nodded.

“In the gardens,” she added. “Something grown here. Shared air.”

I entered the parameters:

**QUERY ANCHORS:**  
— *shared meal*  
— *garden ring*  
— *calm body state*  
— *presence of adversary signatory (anonymized)*  
— *post-ratification / non-ceremonial*

The Borrower pulsed once, as if acknowledging the request.

Ambassador Naran’s throat bobbed as she swallowed.

“And if my future has no such memory,” she asked quietly.

“Then the Borrower will fail,” I said. “And you will have learned something, though not what you hoped.”

She nodded again, as if she’d already considered that possibility and placed it on a mental shelf labeled *acceptable pain.*

I slid the present-self consent form toward her.

She signed with a stylus that left a faint shimmer on the paper—real paper, embedded with verification threads. The signature wasn’t just a name. It was biometric and legal and, in some small way, spiritual.

The future-self consent form remained blank, as it always did. That form wasn’t signed by hand. It was an inference, a read on the resonance itself: if the memory circulated, the Borrower’s designers argued, then the future self had allowed it by living it and holding it in mind in a way that made it retrievable.

A deeply unsatisfying answer for anyone who believed consent should be explicit.

Ambassador Naran stood, smoothing her jacket.

“I’m ready,” she said, and there was no bravado in it—only the exhausted courage of someone stepping into unknown water.

I opened the booth.

Inside, the Borrower looked less like a machine and more like a chair designed by someone who had once held a sobbing stranger. The headrest cupped the skull without restraint. The armrests were warm. Sensors lay embedded in fabric that mimicked skin, not to deceive, but to comfort.

Orison’s ethic: technology should soften loneliness, not erase it. The Borrower didn’t promise you wouldn’t be alone. It offered to sit with you while you looked at tomorrow.

Ambassador Naran sat. The chair adjusted, supporting her spine. She closed her eyes.

I remained outside the booth, at the operator console. My display showed only vital metrics and anonymization status. By law and design, I was not supposed to see the content of the memory itself. This wasn’t surveillance. It was circulation.

Still, the operator console could flag risks: text detection, identity leakage, data anomalies. That was my job: to catch the things the machine could not ethically decide on its own.

“Ambassador,” I said through the booth’s audio, “you’ll feel a transition. Like falling asleep, but with your body awake. If you panic, say so. I can halt the session.”

Her voice came back calm but tight. “Understood.”

I initiated the sequence.

The Borrower’s hum shifted. The amber light deepened to something almost honey-colored. A pulse ran through the booth—low, infrasonic, the kind of sound you felt in your bones. Ambassador Naran’s vitals on my screen steadied, then dipped as her brain chemistry moved toward receptive states.

I watched the anonymization indicator: **STANDARD FILTER ACTIVE.**

The Borrower reached—if “reached” was the right metaphor—along the improbable lattice the physicists described with equations and the poets described with prayer. It sought a future engram in Ambassador Naran’s own mind, a memory that matched the query anchors: garden, food, calm, adversary presence, post-treaty.

For a long moment, nothing happened except the hum and the garden’s distant hush.

Then Ambassador Naran’s breath caught.

Her heart rate spiked. Not panic—anticipation.

On my screen, the Borrower’s status changed:

**MEMORY LOCATED. RESONANCE STABLE.**

**TRANSFER IN PROGRESS.**

I didn’t see images. I didn’t hear words. I saw only the way the Borrower translated a human into data and back: waves, rhythms, spikes of salience.

Ambassador Naran’s body softened. Her shoulders visibly lowered in the chair. Tears slid from the corners of her closed eyes, not as sobs but as the quiet overflow of someone who had been bracing for too long.

Whatever she was seeing—whatever she was *remembering from ahead*—it was reaching her the way the scent of citrus reaches you before you see the peel.

Then my console flashed a warning.

**ANOMALY: TEXTUAL SALIENCE DETECTED.**

I frowned. Textual salience meant that in the memory, Ambassador Naran’s attention had landed—hard—on something readable: a sign, a screen, a plaque, a document, a name. The Borrower’s anonymization filter was supposed to scrub that. If it couldn’t, it would normally dampen that part of the memory, smoothing it into blur.

The warning escalated:

**THIRD-PARTY IDENTIFIER RISK: MODERATE.**

My mouth went dry.

Ambassador Naran’s heart rate steadied again, but her facial muscles moved as if she were smiling at something. She made a soft sound—almost a laugh.

The warning on my console pulsed again, and then, for the first time in my months operating the Borrower, I saw something I was not supposed to see.

Not a full image. Not a clear view.

A fragment.

The console’s anomaly module, designed to help an operator assess risk without consuming content, presented a redacted snippet—three words extracted from the high-salience text, algorithmically chosen to be “non-contextual.”

It failed.

Across my screen, in plain letters, appeared:

**SPINDLE NINE SEALED**

My fingers went cold.

Spindle Nine was not a poem. Not a metaphor. It was an access segment in Orison’s central spine—one of the oldest, most patched, most argued-over sections of the habitat. A place that had been on maintenance reports for years. A place where the library itself shared a wall with life-support conduits and old cable trunks.

A place that, if “sealed,” implied pressure loss.

Hull breach.

Emergency bulkheads.

People running for air.

My console chimed again, softly, as if embarrassed.

**OPERATOR ACTION RECOMMENDED: REVIEW / REPORT / PURGE**

Ambassador Naran, inside the booth, exhaled in a long, satisfied breath. Her vitals registered a surge of warmth—oxytocin, endorphins, the biochemical signatures of relief and closeness.

She was experiencing peace.

And somewhere inside that peace was the phrase *Spindle Nine sealed.*

The unintended detail.

The machine hummed, indifferent. The garden ring whispered, indifferent.

My job was to decide what to do.

I could halt the session. But halting a transfer midstream could shear memory networks, leaving the subject with nausea, dissociation, sometimes worse. We had protocols, but they weren’t guarantees.

I could let it continue and deal with the anomaly afterward.

I could report it immediately to station security or maintenance, but on what basis? A snippet from a future memory? A word fragment from a system designed not to function as warning oracle?

What counted as evidence when the data was intimate—when it was, literally, someone’s felt future?

I swallowed, tasting mint and recycled air.

I let the session continue.

The Borrower’s hum smoothed. The warning remained, blinking patiently, waiting for me like an overdue book.

Inside the booth, Ambassador Naran’s lips moved. She spoke, barely audible through the audio feed.

“I can smell the soil,” she murmured, voice thick with emotion. “It’s… wet. Warm.”

Her hands twitched on the armrests, fingers flexing as if touching something.

“Tangerines,” she whispered. “No. Not tangerines. Something like—”

She laughed softly, and the sound cut through me. It was the laugh of someone who had forgotten to be afraid for a moment.

My console displayed another anomaly:

**THIRD-PARTY FACE RECOGNITION SPIKE: BRIEF**

So the anonymization filter had slipped more than once. It wasn’t just text. It was identity.

A face.

A name.

A person who had not consented to be used as evidence tonight.

Ambassador Naran’s laughter faded into a sigh. Her tears increased, then slowed, as if the memory itself was settling into place.

After a few minutes—the longest minutes in my life, measured in heartbeats and blinking warnings—the Borrower’s hum shifted down.

**TRANSFER COMPLETE.**

**MEMORY IMPRINTED.**

Ambassador Naran’s eyelids fluttered. She opened her eyes slowly, as if waking from a dream she wasn’t sure she deserved.

For a moment she just sat there, breathing, hands resting on warm armrests, cheeks wet.

Then she looked through the booth glass at me.

Her gaze wasn’t the diplomat’s gaze now. It was human. Raw. Almost shy.

“I…” she began, and stopped.

I opened the booth door.

“Take your time,” I said.

She stood carefully, like her legs belonged to someone else for a second. She stepped out and leaned against the booth frame, grounding herself.

“I was in the gardens,” she said, voice hushed, as if afraid to disturb the memory. “Not the promenade gardens. The deep ring. The orchard where the trees grow in that spiral—like a ribcage.”

I nodded. I knew the place. Orison’s orchard was older than most of the habitat’s residents. People went there when they wanted to cry without being asked why.

“There was fruit,” she said. “Orange, but not citrus. The peel—when it broke—there was oil on my fingers. And he—” she stopped.

I felt my throat tighten at the pronoun.

“He,” she repeated, softer. “Or… the person. The other signatory. We were sitting on the bench near the memorial wall.”

Memorial wall.

My console’s warning blinked in my mind: *Spindle Nine sealed.*

She continued, eyes far away.

“We weren’t talking about clauses,” she said. “We weren’t even talking about the treaty. We were talking about… a pipe that had burst. Or a seal. Something mechanical. And it was absurd, because here we are—people who nearly killed each other over docking rights—and we’re arguing about which wrench is better.”

A laugh escaped her again, surprised.

“And I was laughing,” she said, like she couldn’t believe it. “I was *laughing* in his presence. I wasn’t afraid.”

She looked at me sharply.

“That’s not an advantage,” she said, defensive. “It doesn’t tell me what to demand. It doesn’t tell me which clause to push.”

“No,” I said, voice gentle. “It tells you your body can hold peace.”

Her shoulders sagged, as if the words gave her permission to stop defending herself.

“I felt…” She searched. “I felt like I had returned to my own life. Like the war was something that had happened to my parents, not to me. And I know that’s impossible. I know the timeline. I know my scars.”

Her fingers brushed the woven thread on her wrist.

“But in that moment,” she whispered, “peace was not an idea. It was… oil on my fingers. Warm air. Soil smell. A stupid argument about tools.”

Outside the library, the gardens continued their endless rotation. The sound was like distant surf.

I gestured back to the table. “Sit,” I said. “Drink.”

She obeyed, more willingly now, as if the act of borrowing had made her briefly less of a visitor.

We sat with our cups between us again.

Her gaze kept drifting to the booth, like she expected the memory to leak out into the air.

“I have to ask,” she said finally. “Did I… did I see him.”

My spine tightened.

“What do you mean,” I asked, though I knew.

“The anonymization,” she said. “I know you blur. I agreed. But for a moment—just a moment—it was like the fog lifted. I saw… an eye. A scar. The way his mouth pulls when he smiles.”

Director Kade’s face was well-known from broadcasts: the sharp cheekbones, the pale scar running from brow to jaw, the eye that had been replaced with a matte implant after an assassination attempt. A symbol, almost, more than a man.

“You might have,” I said carefully. “The system flagged a brief recognition spike.”

“So it failed.”

“For a heartbeat,” I said.

She stared at her tea.

“I don’t want to use that,” she said. “I didn’t come here to know his future. I came here to know my own capacity. But now I’ve seen him—older, softer, sitting in our orchard like he belongs to the same air as me.”

She looked up, eyes bright with something that was almost anger.

“What am I supposed to do with that.”

There it was, the question underneath all the others.

What do you do with knowledge that arrives in your body before your mind is ready.

“What do you want to do with it,” I asked.

She hesitated.

“I want to believe it,” she admitted. “I want to walk into that signing chamber tomorrow and feel that laugh in my chest, like a hidden anchor. And I want to pretend I didn’t see his scar, because that’s… that’s information. That’s leverage.”

“And hope feels contaminated,” I said.

She exhaled sharply. “Yes.”

I glanced toward my console, where the anomaly warning still waited in quiet bureaucratic patience. *Spindle Nine sealed.*

There was another contamination, too—one she didn’t know yet.

“What counts as evidence,” she said suddenly, voice low, “when the data is intimate.”

I looked at her.

“In my work,” she continued, “we treat evidence as something you can show other people. Something external. Something replicable.”

“And this isn’t,” I said.

“No,” she said. “This is something I can only feel. Something I can’t present to my delegation without sounding insane or manipulative. Something I can’t even fully explain to myself without turning it into narrative.”

She swallowed.

“So is it evidence at all,” she asked, “or is it… just comfort.”

I thought of the library’s shelves. Of the way we preserved journals and recordings and court transcripts not because they were perfectly objective, but because human reality was always partly subjective—and we still had to build a world on it.

“It’s evidence,” I said, “but of a different kind.”

She waited.

“It’s evidence that your future contains a moment you will remember as real,” I said. “Not evidence that you can force it. Not evidence that the treaty must succeed. But evidence that at least one version of you—your future self—lived into a moment where peace was embodied.”

“And if I choose differently,” she said, “does that version of me die.”

I didn’t answer too quickly. Some questions were fragile.

“The Borrower doesn’t show alternate branches,” I said. “It shows one circulated moment. If you choose differently, you might never pay it back. And then you will live with the borrowed thing as a kind of… ache.”

“Like stealing a book and never returning it,” she murmured.

“Yes,” I said.

She stared at her hands, as if she could still feel oil on her fingers.

“I asked about consent,” she said. “Here’s the part I can’t get past: my future self didn’t agree to be used as reassurance tonight. My future self… might hate me for pulling that moment out of context.”

I thought about my console again. About the future moment containing “Spindle Nine sealed.” The future might be speaking through cracks.

“Sometimes,” I said, “people borrow comfort from their own future because their present is unbearable. Sometimes they borrow because they want to be better than their fear.”

She nodded.

“The law,” I continued, “assumes your future self would forgive you, because you are the same person.”

“And if they wouldn’t,” she said.

“Then the memory might be closed,” I said. “Or it might circulate anyway, because the universe is not a lawyer.”

Her laugh this time was bitter.

I leaned forward slightly.

“We built the Borrower with constraints because we recognized your concern,” I said. “One memory only. Anonymization. No recording. Operator oversight.”

“And yet,” she said, gesturing vaguely, “it slipped.”

“Yes,” I said.

She looked at me sharply again.

“What happens now,” she asked, “that it slipped.”

This was the moment the forms didn’t fully cover. The place where law ended and care began.

“We have options,” I said.

I ticked them off with my fingers, feeling suddenly my age, the ache in my knuckles from decades of turning pages and turning over difficult things in my mind.

“One: we do nothing. You carry the memory as it is. You trust yourself not to exploit what you saw.”

She didn’t look convinced.

“Two,” I continued, “we initiate a post-session wash. Not erasure—nothing so violent. A smoothing. It preserves the emotional core and sensory anchors but lets certain identifying details fade faster. Like a dream losing its sharp edges.”

Her eyes widened.

“You can do that?”

“With your consent,” I said quickly. “Always. It’s a safety measure. Sometimes people see something they weren’t ready to carry.”

“And you’re offering it because I saw his face.”

“And because my console flagged text,” I said, and then I stopped.

Because if I said the words *Spindle Nine sealed* out loud, I would make them real in a new way. I would turn an unintended detail into shared evidence. I would invite her into my dilemma.

She studied me.

“You’re withholding something,” she said.

A diplomat’s instinct. Of course.

I forced myself to meet her eyes.

“The Borrower flagged an anomaly,” I said. “Not content I’m allowed to share. A risk marker. My job is to contain it.”

Her gaze held mine for a long second. Then she nodded, slow.

“That’s… fair,” she said, though the word sounded strange in her mouth after months of treaty language. “So. The wash. What does it cost.”

“It costs certainty,” I said. “It costs sharpness. It costs some of the ‘proof’ you felt when the fog lifted.”

“And it preserves the laugh,” she asked, almost pleading.

“Yes,” I said. “If you want it to.”

She stared down at her tea, then up at the booth again.

“I came here because I wanted peace to be believable,” she said. “I didn’t realize I was also asking for it to be… pure.”

“Nothing human is pure,” I said softly.

She exhaled, a long breath.

“Do the wash,” she said.

Relief hit me so hard my eyes stung. Not because it solved the anomaly, but because it proved something about her—something I hadn’t been allowed to borrow from any future memory.

Ethics, embodied.

“Okay,” I said.

I stood and went to the console. My hands moved with the practiced care of someone who had spent decades handling fragile things. I initiated the post-session smoothing protocol and waited for the system to prompt the subject.

A soft chime sounded inside the booth. Ambassador Naran’s wristband lit faintly as it synced.

**POST-SESSION SMOOTHING REQUESTED. CONSENT?**

She pressed her thumb to the band. A green pulse confirmed.

The Borrower hummed again, lower this time, like a cat settling. The amber light dimmed slightly, shifting from honey to lamplight.

On my screen:

**SMOOTHING ACTIVE. IDENTIFIERS DAMPENED. AFFECT ANCHORS PRESERVED.**

Ambassador Naran’s face softened. Her eyes closed briefly, not in sleep, but in acceptance.

When she opened them again, she looked… lighter. Not happy, not naïve. Just less clenched.

She touched her fingers together as if testing whether oil still lived there. Her brows knit, and then eased.

“I can still smell the soil,” she said, amazed. “But the scar—” She frowned. “It’s like trying to remember a stranger’s face from a train window.”

“Good,” I said.

She stared at me.

“So now,” she said, “hope is still hope.”

“Now,” I said, “hope is a feeling you have to earn the context for.”

She nodded once, decisive in a way that reminded me of why people followed her.

“I will sign tomorrow,” she said.

Not *the treaty will succeed.* Not *peace is guaranteed.*

Just: *I will sign.*

A choice, not a prophecy.

She stood, smoothing her jacket again, but this time the gesture felt less like armor and more like someone preparing to step into a room and be human.

At the door, she paused.

“Archivist Venn,” she said.

“Yes.”

“If your console flagged something… dangerous,” she said quietly, “do you act on it.”

There it was. Evidence. Intimacy. Stakeholders across time.

I could lie. I could say the law forbade action. I could say I would file the report and let the station decide.

Instead I chose the truth that fit inside the constraints of my role.

“I act with care,” I said. “I don’t act with panic.”

She studied me for a long moment, then nodded.

“Care,” she echoed, as if tasting the word.

Then she left, the door sliding shut behind her with a sigh like a book closing.

The library settled into its quiet again.

The Borrower’s hum faded to standby. The gardens whispered. Warm recycled air moved over my skin like a hand that didn’t ask permission because it didn’t need to—because it belonged to everyone.

On my console, the anomaly warning still blinked:

**SPINDLE NINE SEALED**

I stared at it until the words felt less like language and more like a physical object in the room with me.

This was the unintended detail.

Not a face. Not a scar.

A future fact, or the impression of one, embedded in someone else’s peace.

A warning wrapped in tenderness like a blade in cloth.

The system offered me three buttons again, patient as bureaucracy:

**REVIEW**  
**REPORT**  
**PURGE**

I could not unsee it.

If I reported it, the safety committees would demand to know why I had such a phrase. They would subpoena my logs. They would question the diplomat. They would, in the name of protecting people, turn the Borrower into an instrument of surveillance. The experiment would be suspended “pending investigation,” and the library would lose the one machine that had, for months now, given grieving widowers and exhausted nurses and scared teenagers a reason to keep living into their own futures.

And the treaty?

If security believed there was a future breach, they would tighten protocols, restrict movement, scrutinize the visiting delegation like a threat. Paranoia would seep into the air like mold.

Peace would become emotionally unbelievable again—not because it was impossible, but because everyone would be too afraid to inhabit it.

If I purged it, I would be destroying a record. An archivist’s cardinal sin.

But archivists knew something else too: not every piece of information deserved to survive.

Some truths were knives that cut the hands that held them.

I leaned back in my chair and listened to Orison’s life: distant footsteps, the faint murmur of someone reading in a corner, the soft mechanical hush of the gardens turning.

I thought of Ambassador Naran’s laugh—how it had sounded like a person coming back to herself.

I thought of the phrase *Spindle Nine sealed* and what it implied.

And I thought of evidence.

What counted as evidence when the data was intimate?

A future memory was not a maintenance report. It was not a sensor log. It was not a fracture scan.

But it could be a prompt.

A nudge.

A reminder to look again at what you already knew.

I opened the station maintenance archive on my console—my domain, my familiar world of stress curves and corrosion models. Spindle Nine’s file was thick with deferred work orders, polite denials, budget negotiations that had stretched for years.

No single report had been enough to force action. Each one was “concerning but within acceptable parameters.” Each one was someone choosing optimism because pessimism cost credits.

I pulled up the latest stress readings.

They were marginally worse than last quarter.

Not catastrophic. Not proof.

But enough, if someone cared, to justify a closer inspection.

My fingers hovered over the keys.

Here was my quiet care.

Not to treat the future phrase as an oracle, but to treat it as a reason to stop accepting “acceptable parameters” as comfort.

I opened a new work order.

**REQUEST: IMMEDIATE INSPECTION / SPINDLE NINE BULKHEAD SEALS**  
**JUSTIFICATION: RECENT STRESS TREND + AGE OF COMPONENTS + LIBRARY ADJACENCY RISK**  
**PRIORITY: HIGH**

I attached the present data—the real data, the replicable data, the evidence that could be shown without invoking borrowed tomorrows.

Then I sent it.

A small act. A pebble dropped into a bureaucratic machine. But Orison ran on pebbles as much as it ran on air.

Only after the request went through did I return to the Borrower’s anomaly warning.

The system still offered:

**REVIEW / REPORT / PURGE**

I stared at *Spindle Nine sealed* one last time.

If I kept it, even in a private file, I would be treating it as a record worth preserving. I would be giving it the dignity of archive, which meant I would also be giving it the potential to be used.

An archivist’s job was not only to keep. It was to protect.

I selected **PURGE**.

A confirmation prompt appeared, as if the machine itself wanted to make sure I understood the weight of what I was doing.

**PURGE WILL REMOVE ANOMALY SNIPPET FROM SESSION METADATA. CONTENT WILL NOT BE RETAINED. CONFIRM?**

I pressed my thumb to the console.

The words vanished.

The screen returned to neutral metrics: session ID hashes, anonymization logs, smoothing confirmation.

A clean record.

A record that did not contain a future breach in plain text.

I sat back, my heart pounding as if I’d done something far more dramatic than delete three words.

In the silence after, I realized something else.

The Borrower was called a library, but it was not really a library. Libraries kept things.

This was closer to a lending desk where you sometimes had to decide that the safest way to circulate solace was to refuse to circulate a knife.

Outside, the gardens kept turning, indifferent to my small rebellion. Warm air flowed through vents, carrying the scent of mint and algae and citrus peel.

Hope, I thought, was still hope even if you had already felt it.

But it was heavier.

It asked you to make choices with no guarantee that the future you’d touched would remain the one you lived into.

I shut down the console, leaving the Borrower in standby. The amber light dimmed to a sleepy glow.

Then, because Orison had taught me that solitude was easier when you moved, I stood and walked out of the library and into the garden ring.

The doors opened to humid warmth and green shadow. Leaves brushed my sleeves. Somewhere, water ran through an irrigation channel with the sound of a distant creek.

I found a bench beneath a spiral of orange-leaved trees—Orison’s strange orchard, the ribcage Ambassador Naran had described. I sat, letting the centrifugal “down” press me into place, letting the habitat hold me the way it held everyone.

In the quiet, I tried not to imagine Spindle Nine sealing. I tried not to imagine alarms.

Instead, I imagined something smaller and harder: Ambassador Naran signing a treaty tomorrow with the weight of laughter in her chest, not because she’d been promised peace, but because she had felt—briefly, anonymously, imperfectly—that her body could live in it.

That, I decided, was the only kind of evidence a future should be allowed to give. Not instructions. Not leverage.

Just enough warmth to make the next step possible.

Above me, leaves trembled in the steady artificial gravity. The gardens whispered, endlessly rotating, endlessly returning.

And somewhere in the station’s maintenance queue, a work order waited like a quiet prayer dressed in engineering language.

Not prophecy.

Just care, submitted on time.

# The Library of Borrowed Tomorrows

The coil woke the way old machines always did—reluctant, dignified, and louder than they meant to be.

A low hum rolled through the room, more felt than heard, as the superconducting ring in the center of the library’s smallest chamber drank its first measured mouthful of current. The sound threaded itself into the bones of the habitat, into the soft vibration of the rotating gardens far down the corridor, into the warm recycled air that never stopped moving and never quite stopped smelling of basil and copper.

I rested my palm on the console’s edge and waited for the hum to find its steady pitch.

There were protocols for everything on Serein Habitat—how to vent a pressure lock, how to comfort a stranger in the lift, how to return a borrowed book to the stacks without making the empty aisles feel accusatory. There were even protocols, now, for *borrowing tomorrow*.

The civic council, in its infinite talent for naming things as if they were already harmless, called the experiment **The Mnemosyne Pilot**.

Everyone else called it the library.

Not because the device looked like literature—though its ring did resemble the haloed spine of some vast, upright book—but because what it offered had the same shape as borrowing: you took something that wasn’t yours *yet*, you carried it home in your body, and you lived with the obligation to return it by eventually becoming the person who could remember it without flinching.

One memory per consenting citizen. One. Legally sanctioned. Monitored. Logged only in the thinnest metadata—time of use, biometric safety, the binary fact that the machine had worked or refused to work. No recording of content. No screenshots. No transcripts. No souvenirs.

A library, in other words, that could not keep a copy of its own books.

I was the one tasked with making that possible.

The council didn’t choose me because I was a neuroscientist—there were far better minds for that, and they had designed the ring years ago before the law caught up with the physics. The council chose me because I was an aging systems archivist, and systems archivists are paid to do three things well:

1. Preserve what must not be lost.
2. Delete what must not be kept.
3. Know which is which when the difference is made of human skin.

I watched the readiness indicators climb from amber to green while the console’s surface warmed beneath my hand. Beyond the chamber’s glass, the main library glowed with lamplight and quiet. Serein had been built by people who didn’t trust grand solutions. The habitat didn’t cure loneliness; it padded its corners.

Hallway lights brightened a fraction when they detected a second set of footsteps nearby—not to announce someone, but to *suggest* company. Public benches ran a degree warmer than private ones. In the gardens, the wind machines sometimes carried laughter from a distant path into an empty walkway, the way an old city carried echoes down alleys.

It never lied. It never told you someone was there when no one was.

It simply refused to let silence be sharp.

The hum stabilized.

On the console, a line of text settled into place:

**MNEMOSYNE COIL: LIVE.**  
**CONSENT INTERLOCK: READY.**  
**SINGLE-RETRIEVAL LIMITER: ARMED.**

I exhaled. Not relief—never that—but the kind of breath you take before you escort someone to a shelf where the books can change their life.

The doorchime sounded, gentle as a fingertip on glass.

I didn’t need the sensor readout to know who it was. The diplomat’s security detail had already announced themselves to station control an hour ago with all the wary politeness of people whose job was to imagine worst futures for a living.

I keyed the door.

Ambassador Kiran Thale stepped in alone.

They moved the way trained negotiators did: not like prey, not like predator, but like someone who had learned that the room itself could be an opponent. Their hair had been cut with the strict symmetry of their home court. Their jacket—dark, collarless, threaded with a faint iridescent pattern that looked plain until the light caught it—was unarmed, unornamented, and still somehow read as armor.

Their eyes traveled once around the chamber, paused on the ring, then found me with the focus of someone who had spent their adulthood translating emotion into policy and policy back into emotion.

“Archivist Quill,” they said. “Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.”

“Ambassador,” I replied. I kept my voice neutral, library-neutral, the tone you use when you don’t want your own hopes to become another person’s pressure. “The coil is ready. Your escort can wait outside; the chamber logs the fact of your presence and nothing else.”

Kiran’s mouth twitched as if they’d nearly smiled and decided it was a luxury.

“I’m told this is the only sanctioned unit in the system,” they said.

“In the treaty corridor, yes,” I said. “In the system—also yes, for now.”

“For now,” they echoed. Their gaze returned to the ring. The hum painted a barely visible tremor in the air above it, like heat over stone. “It feels… impossible.”

“Most civic experiments do until they don’t,” I said.

They stepped closer, stopping at the line of pale inlay on the floor that marked the chamber’s active field boundary.

“Before I request anything,” Kiran said, “I need to hear it again. From you. Precisely what this does—and what it does *not* do.”

I nodded. I’d expected it. People in positions like theirs lived and died by definitions.

“This device retrieves one *memory* from your own future,” I said. “Not a prophecy, not a timeline, not an external feed. You will experience a moment that your future self will later remember as something that truly happened.”

Kiran’s jaw tightened.

“And it can’t be used to—” They cut themself off, then tried again, more carefully. “It can’t show me the outcome of negotiations.”

“It can show you a moment you will one day remember,” I said. “If that moment includes your negotiations, then it includes them. But you cannot retrieve ‘the outcome’ as an abstract. The coil doesn’t answer questions. It lends you embodied experience.”

Kiran’s hands clasped behind their back.

“So I could ask to remember signing the treaty.”

“You could,” I said. “But you can’t demand that the memory be useful. You can’t demand it be *good*.”

“And you said: consenting person.” Their eyes flicked to the console. “My consent is obvious. Who else’s consent is at stake?”

That question, I’d learned, separated the curious from the frightened. The frightened asked if it would hurt. The curious asked who it belonged to.

“The law treats your self across time as one legal person,” I said. “Present-you is authorized to consent on behalf of future-you, because future-you is you. However—” I lifted one finger, because precision mattered “—the device itself has a continuity interlock.”

Kiran leaned in a fraction. Even through their calm I could see hunger there, not for advantage, but for something rarer in their world: certainty that didn’t come from domination.

“The interlock is a safeguard,” I continued. “It requires that the memory you borrow be one your future self will be capable of holding. If the retrieval would destabilize it—if borrowing it now would prevent you from ever living it—then the coil fails. You’ll get static, a refusal response, or nothing at all.”

Kiran’s throat worked.

“So my future self is… a stakeholder. A veto.”

“Not a person sending you messages,” I said gently. “But yes. In the only way the future can be a stakeholder without becoming a weapon.”

They stared at the ring as if trying to see, in the shimmer of its field, a silhouette of themself waiting ahead.

“And privacy?” they asked. “Once I’ve… seen it, can anyone else—”

“No recording,” I said. “No extraction. The chamber monitors your vitals and the coil’s stability. I will be present to stop the session if you’re harmed. That’s all.”

Kiran’s gaze sharpened.

“You make it sound simple.”

“It isn’t,” I admitted.

A slow exhale from them, the first sign that they’d let themself breathe fully since entering.

“And yet,” they said, “here we are.”

Here we were.

Outside these walls, in the diplomatic quarter of Serein, two delegations occupied opposite ends of the corridor like rival tides held back by architecture and etiquette. Tomorrow, they would sign or refuse to sign a treaty that would decide whether the shipping lanes through the Lagrange knots stayed mined, whether the border stations remained armed, whether children learned each other’s songs as foreign language or as threat assessment.

I’d read the briefings, because I archived all the habitat’s civic requests and the council had stamped this one in red: **HIGH CONSEQUENCE / LOW MARGIN / PSYCHOLOGICAL RISK.**

Kiran Thale had requested access to the coil on the eve of signing.

Not for leverage.

For faith.

“Tell me,” I said, “in your own words, why you’re here.”

Kiran’s eyes didn’t leave the ring.

“Because I can sign paper,” they said. “I can trade concessions. I can accept inspections and limit fleets and sit through seven hours of speeches about mutual prosperity.” Their voice remained controlled, but something raw moved under it, like an animal shifting beneath ice. “I can do all of that and still… not believe it. Not in my body.”

I understood what they meant. There were beliefs that lived only in the mind, like maps. There were beliefs that lived in the muscles, like flinch.

Kiran continued, quieter. “My people won’t forgive me for being wrong. The other side won’t survive it if I am.”

“Do you think this device makes you less likely to be wrong?” I asked.

“No,” they said. Then, after a pause, “I think it might make me more capable of being right.”

That was the closest thing to reverence I’d heard from a diplomat.

I tapped the console, bringing up the request interface: not a menu of futures, because that would imply the coil offered choices like a vending machine, but a set of constraints and anchors.

The device required a *category*, an *intention*, and a *sensory foothold*—a way for the mind to point itself toward a memory without turning it into a demand.

The interface labeled them in librarian terms because the council had insisted the public could not be allowed to think of it as divination.

**SUBJECT HEADING:**  
**SEARCH INTENT:**  
**CALL SIGNATURE:**

Kiran looked at the fields as if they were insultingly small for what they were about to ask of time.

“How do I even choose?” they whispered.

“That’s why I’m here,” I said.

They turned their head slightly, and for a moment I saw the exhaustion in their face that their posture had been holding back: the fine lines at the corners of their eyes, the faint bruised shadow of sleeplessness. They weren’t old, but they were *worn* in the particular way of people who spend their life standing on fault lines and trying not to shatter.

“One memory,” they said. “Just one.”

“Just one,” I agreed.

Kiran’s gaze drifted past the ring to the library beyond, where the stacks curved gently with the habitat’s rotation. Paper books lived here—actual paper, sealed and humidity-controlled, a small rebellion against a culture that digitized everything. So did the habitat’s core systems logs, the maintenance diaries, the journals donated by citizens who wanted their private words preserved beyond their own lives.

A library of pasts.

Now a library of tomorrow.

“What do you want it to do for you?” I asked.

Kiran frowned, as if the question offended their sense of procedure.

“I want it to be evidence.”

“Evidence of what?” I pressed.

“That peace is… emotionally real,” they said, and their voice broke on the word *emotionally* as if they’d been trained to speak anything else.

I considered the console’s empty fields.

“I need to tell you something before we proceed,” I said.

Kiran’s shoulders tensed. “Go on.”

“A memory is evidence only to the person who holds it,” I said. “It cannot be presented in court. It cannot be used to compel. You can’t submit it as proof to your senate or council.”

“I know,” Kiran said. “I’m not asking for a weapon.”

“Then what kind of evidence do you mean?” I asked.

They took a long moment before answering.

“The kind that changes the way I walk into a room,” they said. “The kind that stops my hands from shaking when I offer someone my trust. The kind that makes me able to stand in front of both delegations and mean it when I say I believe the treaty will hold.”

I nodded slowly.

There were forms of evidence the law didn’t know how to recognize. The body did.

I turned the console so Kiran could see the prompt fields clearly.

“Let’s treat this like a catalogue search,” I said. “You can’t look up *the future*. You can look up a *moment* that belongs to a category.”

Kiran’s eyes narrowed, suspicious but listening.

“Subject heading first,” I said. “What shelf would your future self file this memory under? Peace. Treaty. Home. Grief. Love. Even those are too big sometimes.”

Kiran stared at the blank line.

“I don’t know,” they admitted. “I’ve never lived in peace. Not really.”

The words hung in the chamber, and the hum of the coil seemed to make space for them, like a respectful silence.

I thought of Serein’s design ethos—softening loneliness rather than erasing it. Not pretending the void wasn’t there, but cushioning the edges so you could touch it without bleeding.

Maybe that was what Kiran needed: not certainty, but a softened edge.

“Then don’t search for peace,” I said.

Kiran blinked. “What?”

“Search for *the absence of vigilance*,” I suggested. “Search for a moment when your body stops scanning the room. Or a moment when you laugh without calculating whether it will be used against you.”

Kiran’s mouth tightened again, but this time it was something like emotion held back.

“A laugh,” they said, almost disbelieving. “That’s your recommendation? For a treaty?”

“It’s the most honest metric I know,” I said. “If your future self can laugh, then whatever you build between now and then includes enough safety for your nervous system to loosen its grip.”

Kiran looked down at their hands, still clasped behind their back.

“I don’t trust laughter,” they said. “It can be cruelty. It can be—” They swallowed. “It can be someone else’s relief that you’re dead.”

“And yet,” I said softly, “you still want to know if you can laugh.”

They didn’t answer, but their shoulders lowered a fraction. That was consent in its earliest form: not signing a form, but allowing the possibility.

“Second field,” I said, tapping the console. “Search intent. Why are you borrowing? Comfort, curiosity, commitment… we don’t restrict motives, but the coil responds better when the intention is true.”

Kiran watched the cursor blink.

“My intention is… to make peace believable enough to do the work required to create it,” they said.

“That’s good,” I murmured. I typed as they spoke, because sometimes seeing your own words in front of you makes them more real.

**SEARCH INTENT:** *To anchor belief in lived peace so I can act in service of it.*

“Call signature,” I said. “This is the foothold. A sensory anchor. A smell, a touch, a sound. Something your mind can use like a ladder rung.”

Kiran’s face creased with confusion.

“I don’t have a smell for peace,” they said. “I have a smell for burning polymer. For sterilant. For the inside of a pressure suit after twelve hours. For—”

“For war,” I finished.

They nodded once.

I thought for a moment, then gestured toward the library door.

“Do you smell that?” I asked.

Kiran inhaled cautiously.

“The gardens,” they said. “Soil. Herbs. Damp.”

“And the air?” I asked.

They frowned. “Warm. Recycled.”

“Everything here is recycled,” I said. “Even our metaphors.”

That earned me a tiny, startled laugh—more of an exhale with sound than a laugh, but it existed, and their eyes widened as if they hadn’t expected their own body to do that in this room.

“Use that,” I said. “Warm recycled air. The hush of rotating gardens. Make it your foothold.”

Kiran stared at me for a long time, and in their eyes I saw the strange fear of someone offered something tender in a world that taught them tenderness was a liability.

Finally they nodded.

I typed:

**CALL SIGNATURE:** *Warm recycled air, rotating gardens hush.*

I turned the console toward them again.

“Now,” I said, “we need to shape the request. Speak it in a way that respects your future self and doesn’t try to corner them.”

Kiran’s voice came out hoarse. “How?”

“Ask for a moment,” I said, “in which the treaty’s peace is not being performed. Not a ceremony. Not a broadcast. Not a speech. Ask for peace when no one is watching.”

Kiran’s throat worked again.

“A private moment,” they said.

“A mundane one,” I corrected. “Mundane is harder to fake than grand.”

They closed their eyes briefly, as if searching through the dark for a door.

Then, quietly, they said, “I want… the first memory I will have, after signing, where I am with someone from the other side and I don’t feel the need to measure the distance to the exit.”

My fingers paused above the keys.

It was a beautiful request. It was also dangerous, in the way all beautiful requests were: it asked for a future where the other side was not merely an entity but a person close enough to trigger the reflex to escape—and close enough that escaping would mean losing something.

“Are you sure?” I asked.

Kiran opened their eyes.

“No,” they said honestly. “But I’m consenting.”

That mattered more than certainty.

I typed their request into the final field:

**RETRIEVAL REQUEST:** *One embodied future memory in which I am in the presence of a person from the opposing delegation and my body does not seek escape; a mundane moment in which peace is unperformed and believable.*

The console displayed the standard warning blocks.

Kiran read them with the speed of someone who had spent their life reading treaties, which meant they saw every clause and none of the grief between them.

> **WARNING:** Borrowed memory may induce longing, dissonance, grief, or altered decision-making.  
> **WARNING:** Borrowed memory cannot be used as legal evidence.  
> **WARNING:** Borrowed memory may contain third-party information; operator is bound to confidentiality protocols.  
> **WARNING:** Retrieval is irreversible. One memory per subject.

That last one always hit hardest. One.

Kiran lifted their gaze.

“Do you ever use it?” they asked abruptly.

It was not in the protocol to answer personal questions. It was also not in the protocol to pretend we weren’t human.

“No,” I said.

“Why?” they asked.

I could have given them the easy answer—that operators weren’t permitted, that the council discouraged it, that we had to remain neutral.

The truth was older and simpler.

“Because I’m afraid of borrowing something I can’t afford to return,” I said.

Kiran’s expression softened. The diplomat mask slipped for a heartbeat, revealing not superiority or pity but recognition.

They nodded once, as if that was the most reasonable thing in the world.

Then they stepped over the boundary line and approached the chair nested at the ring’s center.

The chair was plain by design, upholstered in a fabric that held heat the way skin did. The headrest was adjustable. The contact pads were disguised as seams. No one should feel like they were being strapped into a weapon.

Kiran removed their jacket, folded it carefully, and set it on the side table like a person putting down a burden.

“Last question,” they said, hand on the chair’s back. “If I borrow hope from tomorrow… is it still hope?”

The hum of the coil seemed to deepen, like a cello tuning itself.

I considered the question the way I considered any record request: slowly, with respect for the fact that someone might live or die by my answer.

“Hope,” I said, “is usually something we feel in the dark.”

“Yes,” Kiran whispered.

“If you feel it in advance,” I continued, “it becomes something else as well. Responsibility. A kind of debt. But debt isn’t always bad. Sometimes it’s how we prove we intend to pay.”

Kiran’s fingers tightened on the chair for a moment.

Then they sat.

I adjusted the headrest, guided the contact pads to the right points along their temples, the base of their skull. The device didn’t read minds; it resonated with the brain’s own architecture, seeking the future shape of a memory the way a tuning fork seeks a note.

On the console, I keyed in my operator code.

“Consent phrase,” I said.

Kiran took a breath. Their eyes met mine through the ring’s shimmer.

“I, Kiran Thale,” they said steadily, “request from myself one future memory. I consent to borrow what I will one day remember. I consent to return it by living it.”

The console’s consent interlock flashed green.

The hum rose.

The lights dimmed to a dusk designed not to alarm the nervous system. The chamber’s walls displayed a slow-moving pattern of stars—not to distract, but to give the mind something gentle to rest against as it opened.

Kiran’s eyes fluttered.

Their fingers, resting on the chair’s arms, flexed once as if testing whether they still controlled their hands.

The coil’s field engaged.

And the air changed.

It wasn’t dramatic. It was *subtle*, the way gravity is subtle until it’s gone. A pressure behind the eyes. A quiet shift in my inner ear. The sensation of standing near a massive archive server when it wakes, the faint ion taste of electricity.

Kiran’s breathing steadied into a rhythm that was not sleep and not waking. Their pupils dilated, then constricted, responding to light only they could see.

On the console, biometric lines scrolled: heart rate, oxygen saturation, stress index. The coil’s stability graph held.

This was the part people imagined as mystical. In practice it was like any other delicate system: a balance of thresholds and permissions, a dance between what was allowed and what would break you.

I kept my hands near the abort switch.

Minutes passed. Or seconds. Time in the chamber always felt like that—elastic, polite, refusing to be measured.

Then Kiran’s throat moved.

A sound emerged from them—not a word spoken now, but the faint echo of speech carried on their breath, as if the memory had brought back not just sensation but the shape of language.

It was one of the coil’s quirks: the memory lived fully in the subject, but sometimes, at the edge of retrieval, small scraps leaked into the room like paper fibers caught on a sleeve.

We called it **margin bleed**.

We weren’t supposed to read it.

Kiran’s lips parted.

A whisper, almost inaudible, slipped out.

“…you didn’t even look for the exit,” they murmured, voice distant. “I noticed. I always notice.”

My skin prickled. That didn’t sound like Kiran talking to themself. That sounded like someone talking *to* Kiran.

Third party.

My fingers hovered closer to abort.

Kiran’s stress index rose slightly, then—unexpectedly—fell, as if the words had soothed rather than alarmed.

Kiran exhaled a sound that might have been laughter.

It was small. Uncertain. But it was there.

The biometric line for facial muscle tension dipped.

I watched, fascinated despite myself. To see a body that had lived in vigilance begin to loosen, even in borrowed form, was like watching a rusted hinge finally swing.

The coil hummed steadily.

More margin bleed, soft as a page turning:

“…you promised you’d come back to the library,” a voice said, faintly amused.

Not Kiran’s voice.

A different cadence, lower, warmer, threaded with an accent I recognized from the news feeds: the opposing delegation.

My breath caught.

Kiran’s request had been mundane. Unperformed peace. Presence without escape.

The coil, with its infuriating literalness, had obliged.

Kiran’s mouth curved—really curved this time—into a smile that belonged so fully to their face it startled me.

They whispered, as if answering someone only they could see, “I did come back.”

Their hand twitched on the chair arm, fingers curling as if around someone else’s hand.

A pressure grew behind my sternum.

This was not a public handshake. This was not an official photograph. This was the kind of moment treaties never mentioned and yet always relied on: two people close enough to share breath.

On the console, the third-party information warning icon pulsed.

I swallowed.

*No recordings. No souvenirs. No extraction.*

But the voice—this voice—was leaking into my chamber. Into my ears. Into my mind.

And then, as if the memory itself had noticed my presence and decided to test my professionalism, another scrap surfaced.

Not a voice this time.

A sound.

A soft, rhythmic click. A whine that rose and fell with the subtle oscillation of a rotating mechanism.

My stomach tightened.

I knew that sound.

Not from the coil. From the habitat.

A bearing in the garden ring, slightly misaligned, producing a harmonic you could hear only when the rest of the station was quiet. I’d heard it in maintenance logs. I’d heard it through the soles of my feet when I walked the outer corridor at night.

But the pattern in Kiran’s borrowed memory was different.

Faster.

Sharper.

Not misalignment.

Strain.

A stress whine that in our maintenance classification chart meant one thing:

**Overload. Impending stall.**

My hand moved to the console, pulling up environmental crosschecks. The chamber was isolated; the coil’s field couldn’t directly read station systems, but I could.

All station metrics were normal *now*.

Yet in Kiran’s borrowed moment, the gardens’ rotation sounded like it was fighting to stay alive.

Margin bleed again—words, blurred by distance:

“…Stack Nine sealed? Already?” the other voice said, and there was surprise in it, and something like relief. “Good. I thought we’d lose the paper. And the air.”

Stack Nine.

My throat went dry.

Stack Nine in the library wasn’t just books. It was the archival vault for hardcopy treaties and the manual override panel for a segment of the habitat’s atmospheric circulation—an ancient redundancy kept because the council believed in backups the way some people believed in gods.

“Lose the air,” I whispered without meaning to.

Kiran’s biometric line spiked—tiny, like a fishhook catching a thread.

I forced myself to breathe evenly. Not to speak. Not to pull on the memory as if it were mine to interrogate.

But the unintended detail had already lodged under my ribs like a splinter.

Stack Nine sealed.

A bearing strain whine.

A third-party voice, close enough to Kiran in the memory to share private observation.

And in Kiran’s borrowed laughter, a warmth that felt achingly real.

The coil’s hum dipped, then rose again—the sign that the retrieval was nearing completion.

Kiran’s fingers unclenched.

Their face, still softened by the memory’s emotion, flickered with something else: a moment of pain, quick as a shadow.

And then it was gone.

The console chimed softly:

**RETRIEVAL COMPLETE.**  
**SINGLE-RETRIEVAL LIMITER: LOCKED.**  
**CONTENT: UNRECORDED.**

The coil’s field disengaged. The hum fell to its resting pitch.

The chamber lights returned to their normal warm spectrum, like sunrise in a room that had never been night.

Kiran’s eyes opened.

For a second, they looked lost—like someone waking in the wrong decade. Then their gaze found me, and the diplomat mask tried to reassemble itself out of muscle memory and training.

It didn’t quite fit.

Their cheeks were damp.

They blinked, startled to feel it, and wiped their face with the back of their hand in a gesture so human it almost hurt.

“I—” Kiran began. Their voice cracked. They swallowed, steadied. “I felt it.”

I kept my expression calm. Librarian calm. Inside, my mind was already sprinting down corridors of possibility.

“Take your time,” I said.

Kiran sat up slowly, as if gravity had changed while they were gone.

“It was… ordinary,” they said, awe and disbelief braided together. “It wasn’t a ceremony. It wasn’t a hall. It was…” They closed their eyes, searching for words that could carry sensation. “It was warm air. It smelled like herbs. Someone was laughing at something stupid, and I—” Their mouth trembled, and then, to my surprise, they laughed again. Small. Breathless. “I laughed.”

I let myself exhale, the sound silent.

“That’s what you asked for,” I said.

Kiran’s eyes opened, bright with something that looked dangerously like hope.

“But it felt like more than hope,” they whispered. “It felt… *already real*. Like I’d been there. Like I’d—”

“Borrowed it,” I said.

Kiran nodded slowly, as if the word landed with weight now.

They looked past me, toward the library stacks beyond the chamber glass.

“And the other person,” they said. Their voice lowered. “They said something to me.”

I kept my face neutral, even as my heart thudded.

“What did they say?” I asked, careful. The operator guidelines allowed me to discuss content only if the subject volunteered it. Not to pry. Not to lead.

Kiran’s gaze turned inward, replaying.

“They said… they noticed I didn’t look for the exit,” Kiran said. A soft, stunned smile crossed their face. “As if they’d been watching me do it for years. Like they understood me better than my own staff.”

They shook their head.

“I should feel violated by that,” they murmured. “But I didn’t. I felt… seen. And safe.”

Safe.

The word landed in the chamber like a fragile object.

I wanted to ask who it was. I wanted to know if it was the opposing signatory, if it was someone whose name would detonate a thousand political careers if spoken aloud.

I also wanted to pretend I hadn’t heard the margin bleed at all.

Both desires were equally dangerous.

Kiran’s brow furrowed.

“You’re very still,” they observed, diplomat again. “Did something go wrong?”

“No,” I said quickly. Then, because honesty mattered here more than calm did, I amended, “The retrieval succeeded. But… there was margin bleed.”

Kiran’s expression sharpened. “You heard something.”

“I heard fragments,” I said. “That is rare, but not unheard of. It’s why operators are bound to confidentiality. What leaked into the room is still your memory.”

Kiran studied my face.

“And you can’t tell me what I experienced?” they asked, half challenge, half plea.

“I can tell you only what you tell me first,” I said. “This is your book.”

Their gaze softened again. They seemed to understand the metaphor more deeply now that their body had lived it.

Kiran looked down at their hands, then up at me.

“I’m going to sign,” they said.

The sentence was quiet. It should have been ceremonial, and yet it wasn’t. It sounded like a person deciding what kind of future they intended to repay.

“Tomorrow?” I asked, though I already knew the schedule.

“Tomorrow,” Kiran confirmed. “Because now I know there exists a version of me who… can be there without wanting to run.” Their lips parted. “I didn’t know my body could do that.”

I felt something in my chest twist—not jealousy, not exactly, but the ache of an archivist watching someone discover a record of themself they never knew existed.

Kiran stood, smoothing their clothing as if reassembling reality around their borrowed moment.

Then they hesitated.

“Archivist Quill,” they said, voice careful. “When I was in the memory… I remember hearing the gardens. The rotation. It sounded… strained.”

My pulse jumped.

Kiran had noticed that too.

Not just me.

“Did it?” I said, keeping my tone light, as if this were a casual observation. “Serein’s rotation is stable.”

“I know what stable sounds like,” Kiran said, and there was iron under the softness now. “This was different. Like something was wrong. And there was a mention of… Stack Nine.”

They watched my face like a negotiator reading a comma.

I could have denied it. I could have said, *Memory is subjective. You can’t treat it as diagnostic data.*

But I was a systems archivist. I knew the difference between paranoia and pattern.

“And you heard that,” I said slowly.

Kiran nodded. “Not clearly. But it was there.”

We stood in the chamber with the coil humming behind us like a sleeping animal.

This was the moment the council’s protocols never truly prepared me for:

When the data was intimate and the intimacy contained *infrastructure*.

When a borrowed laugh carried, hidden in its margin, the sound of a system about to fail.

When a person’s future comfort contained the shadow of a danger that might be preventable.

“What counts as evidence,” Kiran murmured, as if continuing our earlier conversation, “when it’s inside your own nerves?”

I held their gaze.

“Evidence,” I said, “is what you’re willing to act on.”

Kiran’s throat moved. “Then what are you willing to act on, Archivist?”

There it was.

Not a request for leverage. Not a demand for prophecy.

A question about my ethics.

I looked at the console. The retrieval logs displayed only what they were allowed to display: success, time, biometric safety.

No content.

No proof.

Only me.

“If there is a vulnerability in Stack Nine,” I said carefully, “it is my job to secure it regardless of where the warning came from.”

Kiran’s shoulders eased, a fraction. “So you believe it.”

“I believe you heard what you heard,” I said. “And I believe the coil does not invent sensory detail. It retrieves.”

Kiran’s eyes flicked toward the library beyond the chamber.

“And if securing Stack Nine changes the future?” they asked, voice suddenly quiet. “If it changes the memory? Does that… break something?”

The question held more than mechanics. It held fear: that by acting, we might erase the very peace they’d just felt.

I thought of the library’s motto—painted in small letters above the returns slot, almost invisible unless you looked up:

**RETURN WHAT YOU BORROW.**

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “The council pretends we do. The physicists will tell you the coil only retrieves what remains coherent under observation—that it can’t show you a moment that can’t survive being known.”

“And yet,” Kiran said, “we’re here.”

I nodded.

“Here’s what I do know,” I said. “If your borrowed memory contains danger, then your future self lived through a world where that danger existed—and where you still found peace mundane enough to laugh.”

Kiran swallowed.

“So peace doesn’t mean no threats,” they said softly.

“No,” I said. “It means threats don’t become your only story.”

Kiran’s gaze drifted, inward again, to the memory they now carried like contraband.

“Then,” they said, “please secure Stack Nine.”

It wasn’t an order. It was a request made with the weight of shared responsibility.

And there was the other part—the part I hadn’t said aloud, because saying it would make it real in a way the coil didn’t require:

The third-party voice.

The closeness in the borrowed moment.

The unmistakable accent of the opposing delegation speaking to Kiran as if they’d known each other long enough to track each other’s nervous habits.

That, too, was unintended detail.

That, too, could wreck a treaty if mishandled.

Kiran didn’t ask me about it. Maybe they didn’t remember it clearly. Maybe they did and had the wisdom not to put it into the air between us.

Consent, I thought, wasn’t only a form you signed.

Sometimes it was the decision not to force someone else’s future into the present.

I inclined my head.

“I will,” I said. “Quietly.”

Kiran’s shoulders lowered, and for the first time since they’d entered the chamber, they looked less like a person holding up an empire and more like a person holding up themself.

“Thank you,” they said.

Then they hesitated at the doorway.

“One more thing,” they added, turning back. “That laugh I heard—my own—felt… strange. Like I was borrowing it from someone else. Like I didn’t deserve it.”

A lump rose in my throat.

“Deserving isn’t part of the physics,” I said gently. “But returning it is.”

Kiran nodded, as if that mattered.

Then they left, the door sealing behind them with a soft pneumatic sigh.

The chamber felt suddenly larger and emptier, the way a library aisle does after someone returns a book you loved.

The coil’s hum continued, indifferent to diplomacy.

I stared at the console.

I should file an anomaly report: margin bleed at moderate level, third-party audio fragments, potential infrastructure acoustic signature. The council would demand details. The council would ask how I knew. The council would, in the name of preventing misuse, threaten to shut the coil down until an investigation completed—an investigation that might outlast the treaty.

And if the coil shut down tonight, Kiran would walk into tomorrow without that borrowed laughter. Without that embodied proof that their body could do peace.

Was that my decision to make?

No.

But I was the one holding the unintended detail.

So I did what archivists always did when the world tried to make them choose between law and life:

I searched for a third shelf.

I opened a blank report field and wrote:

> **ANOMALY REPORT:** Minor margin bleed detected during retrieval.  
> **CONTENT:** Non-recoverable. No recording.  
> **ACTION:** Recommend routine systems audit of Library Stack Nine atmospheric redundancies and Garden Ring bearing harmonics.  
> **JUSTIFICATION:** Preventative maintenance aligned with standard safety schedule.

No mention of Kiran. No mention of the treaty. No mention of the other voice.

Just a maintenance recommendation, filed under the kind of bureaucratic language that kept people alive because it didn’t trigger anyone’s fear.

I sent it.

Then I did something I hadn’t done in months.

I left my console.

The library’s main hall greeted me with its quiet lamplight and the soft presence of other lives—distant footsteps on the upper level, a page-turn in the far stacks, the faint murmur of someone reading aloud to themself near the public terminals.

Serein’s tech noticed I was alone and warmed the lights a shade brighter, not to lie about company but to keep solitude from feeling like punishment.

I walked past the returns slot, past the wall of old paper treaties sealed behind glass, past the alcove where a citizen had donated handwritten letters from the war years with a note that simply read: *Keep these so no one can say we imagined it.*

Down the corridor, the rotating gardens whispered through the habitat’s bones.

I followed that hush to Stack Nine.

The door recognized me, opened with a sigh. The vault’s air smelled different—drier, older. Paper and polymer and the faint metallic tang of the manual override panel embedded in the wall.

I stood before that panel and listened.

Everything sounded normal *now*.

But now was always the easiest time to believe the future didn’t exist.

I keyed in my access, opened the panel, and ran my fingers along the manual valve housings, checking for microfractures, checking for tampering, checking for any sign that someone had already decided tomorrow should be blood instead of ink.

Nothing.

Not yet.

I could have locked the panel behind extra security. I could have alerted station control loudly. I could have pulled the diplomatic corridor into lockdown and watched the treaty die of suspicion before it had a chance to be born.

Instead I did what Serein was built to do.

I softened the edges.

I rerouted access permissions so that any attempt to open Stack Nine’s redundancy panel without my clearance would trigger a silent alert to me alone. Not sirens. Not lockdown. Just a whisper in my ear, the way the habitat whispered companionship into empty hallways.

I scheduled a “routine bearing inspection” for the garden ring at the exact hour the memory’s strain-whine suggested the load would peak—again, no alarm, no accusation, just maintenance in the language of care.

And then, because I couldn’t help being what I was, I filed the smallest possible note into my own private archive—one that no council would ever see:

*Borrowed tomorrow contains laughter.  
Margin contains warning.  
Return requires work.*

When I closed the panel, the vault’s air felt the same.

But my body felt different.

I realized, with a sharpness that made me grip the doorframe for a moment, that I had just made a choice based on a future I could not prove.

Not because I sought advantage.

Because I had heard, through the thin paper wall of time, a human laugh that wasn’t cruel.

And because I had learned, in a room full of warm recycled air and the distant hush of rotating gardens, that hope—borrowed early—was not a counterfeit.

It was a library book checked out against your own name.

You didn’t get to keep it.

You got to live in a way that made returning it possible.

I stepped back into the corridor, and the habitat lights warmed around me as if it had noticed the shift in my breathing.

Somewhere, behind diplomatic doors, Kiran Thale was holding a memory of peace in their chest like a fragile flame.

Somewhere, in the stacked folds of tomorrow, Stack Nine would either seal or fail.

And somewhere inside that borrowed moment—inside the laughter, inside the ordinary warmth—there was the unintended detail I hadn’t spoken aloud: a voice from the other side that sounded close enough to count Kiran’s exits and kind enough to be glad when they stopped looking.

Consent, I thought as I walked back toward the coil’s chamber, was not only permission.

Sometimes it was restraint.

Sometimes it was choosing not to weaponize what the future had let you overhear.

The coil hummed behind its glass, patient and hungry and indifferent.

I returned to my console, sat down, and waited.

Not for prophecy.

For tomorrow to come due.
