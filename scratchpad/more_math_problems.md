**Problems of the 2006 Schweitzer Miklós Memorial Mathematical Competition**
October 27 – November 6

**1.** The *density* (d(X)) of a topological space (X) is the least cardinality of a dense subspace of (X). Prove that if (X) is any compact (T_2) (Hausdorff) space, then the cube (X^3) contains a discrete subspace of cardinality (d(X)).

---

**2.** Let (T) be a finite tree (a finite graph that is a tree) with more than one vertex.

Let (s) be the largest possible number of vertices of a subtree (X \subset T) such that *every* vertex of (X) has a neighbor outside (X).

Let (t) be the smallest positive integer for which there exists a system of stars (C_1,\dots,C_k) in (T) with the following properties:

* every edge of (T) lies in *exactly* (t) of the stars,
* every vertex of (T) lies in *at most* (2t-1) of the stars.

(Stars may occur with multiplicity.)

Prove that (s = t).

---

**3.** Let (f(n)) be the smallest positive integer for which the following statement holds.

If we take (f(n)) points in the plane in general position and color *each* closed segment determined by these points with one of four colors, then there exist (n) pairwise disjoint segments of the same color.

Prove that (f(n) = 6n - 4).

---

**4.** Let (P) be a finite, connected partially ordered set with at least two elements, and let
[
p : P^3 \to P
]
be a three-variable monotone function such that
[
p(x,x,y) = y
]
for all (x,y \in P).

Show that there exists a nonempty proper subset (I \subset P) such that for every (x \in P) and every (y \in I) we have
[
p(x,y,y) \in I.
]

(Here, (P) is called *connected* if, considering comparable pairs of elements as edges, we obtain a connected graph. The function (p) is *monotone* if
[
x_1 \le y_1,\ x_2 \le y_2,\ x_3 \le y_3 \implies
p(x_1,x_2,x_3) \le p(y_1,y_2,y_3).
])

---

**5.** Let (\mathbb{F}_q) be a finite field of order (q) and characteristic not equal to (2). Let
[
V = \mathbb{F}_q \times \mathbb{F}_q
]
be the 2-dimensional vector space over (\mathbb{F}_q). Let (L \subset V) be a subset that contains a line in every direction. (By a line in (L) we mean a line all of whose points lie in (L).)

The *order* of a point in (V) is the number of lines in (L) passing through that point. Prove that (L) contains at least (q) lines that have a third-order point (i.e. a point incident with three lines of (L)).

---

**6.** Define
[
G(x) = \max |A|,
]
where the maximum is taken over all sets (A \subset [1,x]) of integers that contain no 3-term geometric progression; that is, there are no (x<y<z) in (A) with
[
xz = y^2.
]
Prove that the limit
[
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{G(x)}{x}
]
exists.

---

**7.** Suppose (f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}) can be written in the form
[
f = g_1 + \dots + g_k,
]
where (g_1,\dots,g_k : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}) are real-valued periodic functions with periods (a_1,\dots,a_k), respectively.

Does it follow that (f) can also be written as
[
f = h_1 + \dots + h_k
]
where (h_1,\dots,h_k : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}) are *integer-valued* periodic functions, again with respective periods (a_1,\dots,a_k)?

---

**8.** Let
[
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n} ,|2^n x|,
]
where (|x|) denotes the distance from (x) to the nearest integer.

For (Lebesgue) almost every (y \in f(\mathbb{R})), what can be said about the cardinality of the level set
[
L_y = { x \in [0,1] : f(x) = y }?
]

---

**9.** Let (\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}) be the circle. Does there exist a homeomorphism
[
\varphi : \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{T}
]
such that (\varphi) is *singular* (that is, its derivative is (0) almost everywhere) but the map
[
f : \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{T},\quad f(x) = \varphi^{-1}(2 \cdot \varphi(x)),
]
is absolutely continuous?

---

**10.** Let (K_1,\dots,K_d) be convex compact subsets of (\mathbb{R}^d) with nonempty interior. Assume they are *strongly separated*, meaning that for any choice of points
[
x_1 \in K_1,\dots,x_d \in K_d,
]
the affine hull of ({x_1,\dots,x_d}) is a hyperplane in (\mathbb{R}^d).

Let (0 < \alpha_i < 1) for each (i = 1,\dots,d). A halfspace (H) is called an (\alpha)-*cut* if
[
\operatorname{vol}(K_i \cap H) = \alpha_i \operatorname{vol}(K_i)
\quad\text{for all } i,
]
where “(\operatorname{vol})” denotes (d)-dimensional volume.

How many (\alpha)-cuts are there?

---

**11.** Let (\alpha) be an irrational number, and let
[
F = {(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y \ge \alpha x}
]
be the closed half-plane bounded by the line (y = \alpha x).

Let
[
P(\alpha,n) = \mathbb{P}(X_1,\dots,X_n \in F),
]
where ((X_n)) is the simple symmetric random walk on the plane starting from the origin (i.e. at each step we move one unit in one of the four coordinate directions, each with probability (1/4), independently of the previous steps). Thus (P(\alpha,n)) is the probability that during the first (n) steps the walk stays entirely in the half-plane (F).

Prove that (P(\alpha,n)) does not depend on (\alpha).
