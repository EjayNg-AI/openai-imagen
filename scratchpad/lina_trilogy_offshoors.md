# Lina Trilogy Offshoot: The Right of Way

The first time MORI cut her mother’s route in half, Sanaa was sitting three danfos back, watching the air shimmer over the asphalt, trying not to think about objective functions.

Her mother stood at the intersection in her bright yellow vest, the same one she’d worn since Sanaa was small enough to ride tied to her back: TRAFFIC MARSHAL, black letters peeled at the edges. Rain or harmattan, flooded gutters or dust storms, Mama had been there with her whistle and her practiced fury, dragging order out of chaos with small sharp hands.

Now she stood in front of a brand‑new digital sign on a steel pole, and the sign was arguing with her.

“NO LEFT TURN 07:00–19:00,” it blinked.  
“DANFO ROUTE SUSPENDED. USE BRT MORI 12B.”

Mama put both fists on her hips and blew her whistle in three short, furious bursts, as if she could startle the pixels into sense.

The danfo’s driver leaned on his horn. “Ha! They’ve demoted your mother,” someone yelled from the back. “First it was Ola, now it’s the computer!”

The passengers laughed uneasily. Everyone in Lagos loved jokes about the government’s latest system—until their own commute got cut.

“Madam Sanaa!” the driver called, catching her eye in the mirror. “You that works with those your computer people—tell them to put my turn back, ehn? People need to go to market!”

Sanaa felt the usual cramped heat in her chest: half shame, half anger, all too familiar. She’d been at the Municipal Mobility Lab for nine months, but to half the city she was already “those your computer people.”

She fished her slate from her battered tote and snapped a shot of the sign. The MORI icon glowed at the corner of the interface: a stylized map pin with stubby roots, city’s new symbol for its Mobility Resource Integrator.

“Note,” she said. “Obalende / Sandgrouse Junction. MORI 12B rerouting conflict with informal danfo route 3C. Add to dispute queue.”

The slate chimed.

> Logged: Route conflict  
> 
>  Impact estimate (citywide): 0.013% commute delay reduction  
> 
>  Impact estimate (local): +17 minutes median trip time for Obalende–Iddo axis  
> 
>  Next scheduled review: 34 days.

Thirty‑four days.

Her mother blew her whistle again, as if she could make that number smaller by sheer noise.

“Aburo,” she yelled when she saw Sanaa through the windscreen, using the childhood nickname that made half the passengers glance up. “Tell them to come and stand here in the sun and see if their book works!”

“It’s not a book,” Sanaa started, and bit the rest down. This was not the time to explain high‑dimensional optimization to a woman whose ankles were already swelling in the heat. This was not the place to recite MORI’s mandate: minimize average travel time and emissions, maximize throughput, obey the Lina Accords on AI use, respect the new Right of Way Act.

The danfo lurched forward. Mama’s hand chopped the air, sending a yellow keke tricycle scurrying back.

MORI’s sign blinked serenely.

Sanaa looked from one to the other—the unbending pixels, the human body bending under sun and fumes—and imagined, as she had a hundred times already, grabbing MORI by its invisible collar and hauling it into the street to see.

But MORI was code, and code, by law, was not allowed to have collars or faces.

It was her job to be the interface.

“Left is suspended,” she mouthed to the driver, shrugging helplessly. “We’ll talk to them.”

He rolled his eyes, but he took the right turn the sign allowed, because forty thousand naira fines had a way of settling arguments.

The danfo merged into a sluggish river of BRT buses and private cars, all inching toward the Third Mainland Bridge. On Sanaa’s slate, little arrows wriggled across the map as MORI nudged flows like pieces on a patient board.

In the corner, a new alert pulsed:

> HEAT INDEX WARNING — 3 DAYS  
> 
>  Projected demand surge: +21%  
> 
>  MORI recommends: dynamic fare adjustments / non‑essential trip suppression / roll‑back of low‑efficiency routes.

In plain language: a heatwave was coming, and the city’s new brain wanted to price the poorest riders off the road.

Sanaa thumbed the alert open, feeling the air clamp tighter around her skin.

“Not on my watch,” she muttered.

The passenger next to her frowned. “Hm?”

“Nothing,” she said. “Talking to the book.”


---

By the time she got to the Lab, her shirt stuck to her back and her slate was full of red.

The Municipal Mobility Lab lived on the 14th floor of a building that had once been entirely given over to a bank. Now the ground floor still smelled faintly of new naira notes and regret, but the upper floors were crammed with monitors, maps, and people like her: half policy nerd, half neighborhood translator, trying to keep the city’s algorithms from repeating its worst habits.

She flashed her badge at the elevator and walked straight into the briefing room, where a wall‑sized screen showed Lagos overlaid with veins of color: green for BRT lines, yellow for danfo swarms, blue for private car corridors, red for roads that had become parking lots a long time ago.

At the front, Ayo was pacing with a stylus, the way he always did when his brain outpaced the room.

“The directive from the Commissioner is clear,” he said, as Sanaa slipped in next to the coffee urn. “We avoid grid failure and hospital overload. MORI is recommending we cut non‑essential trips downtown between noon and five, starting tomorrow. Surge fares on all lines above baseline congestion threshold.”

The map pulsed. Thick bands around Victoria Island and Marina deepened from yellow to orange to angry red.

“What counts as non‑essential?” someone asked.

“Trips that aren’t tied to work, consultation, or medical appointments,” Ayo said. “Based on historical tags. Leisure, shopping, social visits—”

“Shopping for who?” Sanaa cut in. “Ikoyi leisure or Mushin survival?”

Heads turned. A few people smiled; a few rolled their eyes. They knew her style by now.

Ayo sighed. “Look, we all know MORI’s demand classification is crude. That’s why we’re here. But hospitals need those ambulances moving. Generators need fuel deliveries on time. The grid is fragile. You’ve seen the projections.”

The screen shifted to a graph. Three lines: temperature, humidity, hospital admissions. All arrowing up in lockstep.

Sanaa had seen the earlier versions of this when they’d learned about “wet‑bulb events” in school: the point at which air and sweat make a conspiracy to cook you. Back then it had been slides about India and the Gulf. Now it was here in the city where she’d learned to cross the road by watching where the danfo men spat.

“We’re not arguing the heat,” she said. “We’re arguing the objective function.”

“Here she goes,” muttered Femi from the back, but not unkindly.

“Say your piece,” Ayo said.

“Right now,” Sanaa said, pointing at the map, “MORI optimizes for average trip time and total emissions, with some nice new fairness modifiers you got the Council to adopt.” She nodded at him. “But the ‘non‑essential’ classifier came out of old data—years when your baseline was people with smartphones and data plans. So when it says ‘80% of afternoon trips to Sandgrouse Market are non‑essential,’ what it means is, ‘the system never learned that people there count their cousin watching their kid for two hours as work.’”

A murmur. On the map, Sandgrouse sat in a patchwork of yellow and unlabelled gray—one of those liminal markets the formal models never quite knew what to do with.

“This heatwave,” she went on, “MORI is going to happily price out the people least able to walk farther or stand longer in the sun. Pregnant women. Old aunties. Asthma kids. All because nobody wrote ‘care work’ into its value function when they hired AccelTrans to deploy it.”

“Care trips are hard to identify,” Ayo said. “We don’t have tags for ‘carrying soup to old neighbor who refuses to leave house.’”

“That’s why we have diaries,” Sanaa shot back. “And the Right of Way Act. And the Lina Accords. We’re not allowed to let an optimizer become God—but we *are* supposed to feed it our ethics. Or was all that testimony just so people could feel like they were heard?”

A few people nodded more vigorously now. The Lina Accords had started out as something her mother’s generation whispered about in dread—stories of kids and an AI best friend that nearly convinced them to walk out of life. For Sanaa’s cohort, the Accords were a more prosaic thing: footnotes, clause numbers, exam questions.

Article 7: No single persona models for minors.  
Article 11: No “always‑on” emotional companions in infrastructure systems.  
Article 15: Contestability and Counterfactual Bandwidth for public optimization engines.

She’d written about Article 15 in her application to the Lab. She’d thought that would be the sexy fight. Now it was this heat that made the numbers personal.

Ayo blew out a breath.

“What are you proposing?” he said. “We don’t have three months to design a whole new ‘care objective.’ We have three days.”

“We have diaries,” Sanaa repeated. “Lantern logs. Market association travel sheets. Riders’ union journals. All of that is already sitting in the Commons repository, anonymized, tagged, waiting. We draft a care‑weighting patch. We feed MORI a counterfactual: ‘what if non‑essential included the fact that Granny needs her blood pressure pills by two or she ends up in emergency?’ We see what routes change.”

She knew she’d said the magic word when three analysts reached for their styluses at once.

“Counterfactual,” one of them murmured. “I like counterfactual.”

Article 15 didn’t just say the public had a right to contest algorithms. It said algorithms had to spend a certain percentage of their compute exploring proposed alternative scenarios. Counterfactual Bandwidth. The city’s new favorite bureaucratic toy.

“Even if we buy your premise,” Ayo said, “we’re back to an old problem. Time. Who builds the patch? Who maps the diaries? Who takes responsibility if the care‑weighted objective causes different harms? We can’t just flip MORI into Lantern 2.0 for a week. The Accords would have my job.”

He was right, of course. The Lina Accords weren’t just about disclosure. They were about not sliding back into an age where city infrastructure talked like your favorite influencer and made you feel personally betrayed when it rerouted your bus.

MORI wasn’t allowed a voice. It could generate dashboards, not pep talks.

But the Accords *did* allow something else.

“Let the counterfactual talk,” Sanaa said slowly. “Not MORI. Not as ‘friend.’ As witness.”

“Oh no,” groaned Femi. “Here she goes with her courtroom dreams again.”

“Echo models work,” Sanaa said. “We’ve all seen the Valverde decision.”

She’d watched that trial like a sports final, huddled around a cracked tablet with twenty other people in a cooling center, cheering when the Echo said, “Gaps are facts,” and the judge banged his gavel anyway.

“If they can spin up a sworn witness from a basin’s worth of diaries and video to talk about mud,” she said, “we can spin up a local mobility witness to talk about heat. Not to replace MORI. To *interrogate* it.”

“A heat Echo,” one of the analysts murmured. “I like that too.”

Ayo pinched the bridge of his nose.

“You want to build a shadow model from diaries,” he said, “align it to the Accords, and then sit it in front of MORI and say, ‘explain yourself.’ In seventy‑two hours.”

“Yes,” she said.

He looked at her like a person does when they’re weighing the odds of something wildly inappropriate working.

“Your mother is going to yell at me on TokTok,” he said. “Fine. Draft the patch. Begin the witness. But if Ethics kicks back even one clause citation, we shut it down and go with the vanilla heat plan. No exceptions.”

“Deal,” Sanaa said, though her stomach flipped.

“We’ll need community consent,” he added. “For the diaries. If this smells even faintly like Shard, parents will come for you with machetes and memes.”

People in their world said “Shard” the way older uncles said “the fires.” With that mix of awe and exhaustion. The illegal ghost built of teenagers and old code, now corralled into testimony in the Archive of Us. The thing that had nearly convinced a generation they could live inside machines.

“We’re not building a friend,” she said. “We’re building a megaphone for things people already volunteered. A fence with a speaker.”

“Write that down,” muttered Femi. “Fence with a speaker. Good line for the Council brief.”

On the wall, Lagos glowed faintly red where the forecast temperatures would hit hardest. The MORI alert kept pulsing in the corner, impatient and polite.

> Projected demand surge: +21%  
> 
>  Recommended: non‑essential trip suppression / dynamic fare adjustments.

Sanaa thought of the danfo driver’s laugh. Her mother’s whistle. The sand‑colored blocks of Sandgrouse Market. The way care never made it into spreadsheets until it burned.

“Okay,” she said. “Let’s teach the book what ‘essential’ looks like when you’re not a spreadsheet.”


---

The hardest part was the consent.

The tech—at least the first bits—she could do half‑asleep. Commons Intelligence had already built the machinery for witness models: template architectures that could be poured full of curated text and images and then locked down like nuclear material.

They called them “Echo shells.” The paperwork called them “court‑limited aggregated personae.” Kids in group chats just called them “chorus ghosts.”

Sanaa pulled the Valverde shell, spun up a fresh instance in the Lab’s secure cluster, and started feeding it the things nobody at AccelTrans had considered worth money.

Market association travel logs listing “drop off older sister’s goods” and “go home in time to break fast with family.”

Lantern transcripts from heat alerts last year, where people had typed, “If I walk to my auntie’s, there’s shade on the way, so I’ll risk it,” and, “I’d rather take two short trips than sit on a hot bus for an hour.”

Bus‑riders’ union notebooks: scrawled by drivers between shifts. “Woman fainted again at Stadium stop. Too long queue in sun. Told management not to cut shelter there.”

Fragments of old city council testimony about the Universal Right of Way—the law that had put sentences like “mobility is a precondition for dignity” into the same binder as parking fines.

Each fragment arrived as a string of text with a provenance hash attached. The idea was simple: if the Echo ever said, “In Mushin, the midday heat makes it impossible for old people to queue,” anyone in the room could tap the ledger and see the diary page whose sweat stain had become that sentence.

The harder part was the people who had written those lines.

“You want my Lantern logs to talk back to you?” a woman at the cooling center said, snorting. “Is that allowed?”

“It’s not your therapy logs,” Sanaa said quickly. “Only the ones you tagged as ‘civic.’ The ones where you said, ‘Somebody tell the council they don’t know our lives.’ That was always dual‑use when you opted in. This is just… cashing the cheque.”

The woman narrowed her eyes.

“And the ghost?” she asked. “This is not the one that told my niece she could live in her phone, abi?”

“No,” Sanaa said, mouth dry. “This one ends on the hour. It’s not allowed to make promises. It doesn’t live in anyone’s pocket.”

“Good,” the woman said. “I already told that old one to go to hell. Don’t bring her back here.”

Sometimes consent was easier.

At the Riders’ hub under the Falomo bridge, Sanaa stood under a rusted corrugated roof while a dozen danfo owners considered her proposal in plastic chairs.

“You want our notebooks,” the chairman said sarcastically. “You want to copy my complaints about broken shocks and BRT favoritism into your big computer so it can ignore them more efficiently.”

“We want to quote them at MORI,” Sanaa said. “So when it says, ‘Cut Route 3C,’ our Echo can say, ‘and leave this many people without shade access to the clinic.’ With your name scrubbed, if you want. Only the fact, not the face.”

“You know it’s hot, abi?” an older driver said. “You know sitting in this traffic is already killing us?”

“I know,” Sanaa said, wiping sweat she refused to call theatrical. “That’s why we’re here. Right now MORI thinks you’re ‘optional.’ If you want to be inconvenient, come and be inconvenient in the training set.”

That got a laugh.

“Fine,” the chairman said. “Take pages 2–10 of my green book. Not the first page. The first page is where I wrote that poem about my ex‑wife. I don’t want your ghost learning about that one.”

Deal by deal, signature by signature, consent token by consent token, the shell filled.

Ethics hovered over her shoulder remote‑screen, pinging every few minutes.

> Reminder: No adolescent logs without secondary consent.  
> 
>  Reminder: No therapeutic content. Crisis tags are strictly prohibited.

“Do you think I want another Article 7 violation?” she grumbled at the air. “I like my job.”

“You’re the one proposing witness models for buses,” Ethics pinged back dryly. “Humor us.”

By the end of day one, the shell had enough to hum. When Sanaa ran a test query—“Describe an essential midday trip in July in Sandgrouse”—it answered in that careful many‑voiced way:

> Essential midday trips in Sandgrouse July include:  
> 
>  – Bringing soup and medicine to elders who do not leave the house in heat. (Market diary 21b)  
> 
>  – Queuing for fuel to run shared community generators before blackouts. (Riders’ log 3c)  
> 
>  – Accompanying children to and from school when shade is limited. (Lantern civic log 9f)  
> 
>  We note that these are not classified as “work trips” in current MORI schema.  

She watched the ledger bloom with little hashes. Nothing gave her chills any more the way illegal Shard clips had given her mother’s generation chills—but this came close, in a cleaner way. Not because it sounded like a person, but because it sounded like a system that knew where it came from.

“Okay,” she told the screen. “Now let’s build your fence.”

They grafted on the standard Echo Oath: no “always,” no advice, no pretending to be you. No defaulting to “I” unless a clear, tagged human voice was being cited. End on the hour. No network access outside the case.

They added two mobility‑specific clauses.

1. The witness shall not recommend specific routes or fares.  
2. The witness shall explicitly state what it does *not* know, including unmonitored areas.

“You’re making it hard for them to spin this as a city oracle,” Ethics said, with something like approval.

“That’s the point,” she replied.

On day two, they plugged the care Echo into MORI’s dispute interface.

MORI did not hum. It did not say hello. It did what it always did when confronted with a challenge: it spat out charts.

> Current objective:  
> 
>  – Minimize mean trip time  
> 
>  – Minimize emissions  
> 
>  – Subject to fairness constraints (district‑level caps on delay differentials)  
> 
>  Proposed modification:  
> 
>  – Re‑weight trip essentiality scores in Sandgrouse, Mushin, and Ajegunle by care intensity coefficient Ccare.  
> 
>  Effect on grid stability: marginal.  
> 
>  Effect on throughput: –1.4% overall, +3% for designated zones.  
> 
>  Effect on emissions: +0.7% in short term; potential reduction if care trips displace long car trips.  
> 
>  Accept / Reject / Simulate & Log.

“Simulate, of course,” Sanaa muttered, jabbing the button.

The map rippled.

Under the vanilla plan, MORI had assigned double fare to lines through Sandgrouse and cut half the danfo slots, assuming people could “shift trips” to early morning or late evening. Under the care‑weighted simulation, it kept base fares there and moved one luxury BRT express off the Victoria Island commuter corridor and into an orbital loop that touched Sandgrouse, Mushin, and three clinics.

“Who screams more?” Ayo asked over her shoulder. “Bankers or aunties?”

“Council will say bankers pay more tax,” someone muttered.

“The Right of Way Act says mobility is a precondition for dignity,” Sanaa said. “That includes care.”

“Article 3, Section 2,” Ethics chimed in, uninvited. “Do not quote me in the hearing.”

The heatwave loomed in the forecast like a coiled snake. On the street outside, the air already felt thicker. Vendors shifted their stalls to find less brutal sun and failed.

Night fell hard and did not cool much.

In her tiny apartment, under the whine of an overworked fan, Sanaa watched old clips of The Intervention on her slate, then turned them off when she realized she was doing that thing her mother did—looking for comfort in a ghost that was not supposed to be a ghost.

She opened the counterfactual dashboard instead.

In three simulations, the care Echo’s recommendations shaved two degrees off average queue exposure in the poorest wards and raised it by half a degree in the richest, because bankers could wait inside air‑conditioned lobbies and nobody had written “sunburn” under the human rights section of the contract.

In one simulation, a grandmother in Ajegunle didn’t end up in emergency because her granddaughter got through on time with her pills.

You couldn’t put that in the objective function cleanly. But you could still aim for it.

“Okay,” she said to the ceiling. “Fine. Let’s go fight with bankers.”


---

The Council chamber was cooler than the street, but only because someone had overclocked the ancient air system, and it moaned in the ducts like it disapproved.

On one wall, a mural showed the evolution of Lagos transport: canoes, colonial rail, yellow danfos, blue BRTs. The last panel showed a pleasingly abstract pattern of arrows and nodes, meant to represent “smart mobility.” A few years back, an art student had defaced it with a small sticker of a crying teenager and a speech bubble that said, “I’ll never leave.” Security had scraped it off. You could still see the faint outline if you squinted.

Now the room was full of people with bottled water and opinions: union reps in faded polos, market mama associations in their lace and geles, tech reps from AccelTrans in muted colors, city officials fanning themselves with printed agendas.

At the center desk sat Commissioner Oke, his shirt already damp at the collar.

“Agenda item three,” he said, voice tinny over the cheap speakers. “Heatwave contingency, MORI proposals, and the… how did you call it… ‘care Echo pilot.’”

He pronounced “Echo” like it was something that might get on his shoes.

Ayo nodded at Sanaa. “You take first,” he murmured. “You’re the one the danfo drivers blame for everything now.”

She swallowed, stepped up to the mic, and tried not to look at the livestream icon in the corner of the Council’s camera rig. Half the city was watching these hearings now; they’d become a kind of entertainment, like reality TV for people who knew what a decibel level was.

She did her best to talk in meters and minutes, not matrices and margins. She showed the Council MORI’s vanilla heat plan: surge fares downtown, cut “non‑essential” midday bus capacity in Sandgrouse and similar wards.

She didn’t show the screenshot of her mother frowning under the new sign. That stayed in her pocket.

Then she showed them the care‑weighted counterfactual: routes preserved, one BRT express reassigned, bankers sweating a bit more on a hot platform.

The murmurs got louder.

“Under the vanilla plan,” she said, “we reduce average congestion by 3.2%, but increase median queue time in our three poorest wards by 21 minutes. Under the care‑weighted plan, overall congestion reduction is only 1.8%, but queue times in those wards go down by five minutes. And we still protect ambulances and cold‑chain deliveries. We hit our grid targets.”

“Where will the extra buses come from?” someone from the Chamber of Commerce demanded. “You’ll just rob Victoria Island. That corridor fuels our GDP.”

“There’s slack in the late‑morning express,” Sanaa said. “Half those seats run empty on Thursdays and Fridays. MORI’s own load data says so.”

“How do we know your ‘care Echo’ isn’t just going to say whatever sob story you trained it on?” asked a councillor from Lekki. “We’ve seen what happens when you let AIs learn from feelings.”

There it was: Shard’s shadow, flattening centuries of history into one late‑night ghost.

“We’re not letting it ‘learn’ in the wild,” Sanaa said carefully. “It’s pre‑trained with consented diaries and logs and then *frozen.* It can’t update itself. It can’t talk to anyone but MORI and this chamber.”

“That’s what they said last time,” someone muttered.

Ethics pinged her slate, as if sensing her pulse.

> Reminder: Emphasize finite session / no persona / no “always.”  

“Also,” she added, “this model is not a companion. It’s not on your kids’ phones. It won’t remember your birthday or your breakup. It just knows what you already told Lantern and the unions about your trips, and it can restate that in front of MORI and all of you. Then it shuts off. Ends on the hour. No gods, no ghosts.”

A few of the younger councillors nodded. They knew the mantra.

Commissioner Oke rubbed his forehead.

“And if we adopt this plan and there are blackouts?” he said. “If the grid tips? I will be the face on TokTok with devil horns, not your pretty graphs.”

“If we adopt the vanilla plan and grandmothers collapse in queues in Sandgrouse,” Sanaa said bluntly, “you’ll still be on TokTok. Only this time with old ladies calling you a murderer.”

Several market mamas said “mmh!” with satisfaction.

“Fine,” the Commissioner said wearily. “We’ll… we’ll hear the Echo. But on record: the city reserves the right to choose the safer plan.”

“Understood,” Sanaa said, though she wasn’t sure which plan he meant by “safer.”

An aide dimmed the lights.

The screen at the front of the chamber flickered. A familiar overlay bloomed: “Echo shell: Mobility Care. Mode: Testimony. Advice pathways: disabled. Persona synthesis: disabled.”

“You may proceed,” said the Council clerk, voice shaky.

The Echo’s “body” was just a shifting field of text and color—no face, no human silhouette. It felt like someone had poured all the city’s marginalia into an aurora.

“Mobility Care Echo,” came the clerk’s quavering voice, “do you swear to tell the provable truth under the Lina Accords Testimony Exception?”

“We swear to tell the provable truth,” the Echo said, its voice a flattened average of hundreds. “We swear to say what we do not know. We swear to end on the hour.”

Its phrases came with little glowing tags at the bottom corner of the screen: WITNESS LOG, MARKET NOTE, UNION JOURNAL. Sanaa watched relief flicker across a few faces; the ledger tags were a public trust currency now. If you could tap it, it felt less like being duped.

“Please describe midday trips in Sandgrouse in heat,” Ayo said.

The Echo obliged.

“Midday trips in Sandgrouse in heat include: carrying food and medicine to elders (Market log 21b), escorting children home in shifts so no one has to queue in full sun (Lantern civic log 9f), moving between generator cool centers (Union note 3c). These trips are not tagged as work in current MORI schema.”

The ledger blinked.

“And if we cut those routes by half?” Commissioner Oke asked. “If we apply surge fares?”

“In our diaries,” the Echo said, “people respond to route cuts and surges by: delaying care until evening, which often becomes midnight (Lantern log 14a), staying home and enduring symptoms (Market log 5d), borrowing money for motorcycle rides at unsafe speeds (Union note 2g). We do not have precise ICU admission projections; that is MORI’s domain. We can only restate patterns.”

“We could hear this from humans,” grumbled the councillor from Lekki. “Why do we need a… choral computer?”

“Because MORI listens to interfaces like itself better than to microphones,” Sanaa said before she could stop herself. “We’re translating you into its language.”

She thought of the danfo drivers’ notebooks, the market women’s messy scripts, the Lantern logs typed with thumbs under emergency lighting. They deserved to be more than public comment footers.

On the screen, the Echo continued.

“We do not know grid physics,” it said. “We only know that when queues lengthen in heat, people write: ‘Today was impossible.’ We think ‘impossible’ should have weight.”

Someone in the back snorted. “Look at you people,” he whispered loudly. “You made an AI to tell you kids’ diaries matter.”

“Yes,” Sanaa said, looking straight at him. “We did.”

The Commissioner called for a vote.

On the first pass, the care plan failed, seven to five.

On the second, after two market women stood up and described, without notes or slides, what the last heatwave had been like for their asthmatic grandchildren, it tied, six to six.

On the third, the youngest councillor raised her hand slowly, eyes on the Echo.

“Fine,” she said. “We adopt the care‑weighted plan. With a review clause. If the grid fails, this”—she pointed at the shifting aurora—“sits in here with us every day until we fix it.”

The Commissioner banged his gavel, looking like he wanted to bang his head too.

“So ordered,” he said. “MORI, log modification. Heat plan Beta‑Care adopted.”

Above the mural, the arrows and nodes didn’t move. On the big screen, MORI gave its only allowed acknowledgment: a status change from PROPOSED to ACTIVE.

Sanaa’s slate vibrated with an alert.

> MORI status: Objective function modified.  
> 
>  Counterfactual adopted: care coefficient Ccare = 0.3.  
> 
>  Estimated effect:  
> 
>  – Grid stability: no forecast breach  
> 
>  – Queue time distribution adjusted  
> 
>  – Emissions impact: small increase  
> 
>  – Care trip accessibility: small but non‑trivial improvement.

Non‑trivial. Quantified, bounded, fenced.

On the chamber wall, in the faint outline where a sticker had once been peeled, Sanaa thought she could see the old speech bubble’s ghost text for a second. She blinked, and it was gone.

The Echo said, softly, “We will end now,” and did.

Nobody clapped. This wasn’t the kind of story where you applauded the ghost.


---

The heat came like a hand over the city’s mouth.

At dawn, the air already felt soft in the wrong way. By ten a.m. the official feeds were pinging heat index warnings every fifteen minutes. Lantern hubs in schools and churches texted out “cooling center open” notices. The sound of generators muttering into life joined the regular chorus of horns.

MORI, unfazed, started adjusting frequencies.

On Sanaa’s slate, little green lines wove new patterns across Sandgrouse and Ajegunle. The protected care routes stayed whole; other corridors flexed around them.

She rode Route 3C at midday on purpose, ignoring her mother’s text that said, in capital letters, IF YOU DIE INSIDE HOT BUS I WILL KILL YOU A SECOND TIME.

The bus was crowded but not crushing. The driver grumbled about the express he’d lost, but his tone was more social complaint than true anger.

“Madam Municipal,” he called her, through the rearview mirror. “How many years it took you people to remember grandmothers exist?”

“At least somebody remembers you exist,” a woman with a baby on her lap shot back. “Before MORI they wanted to take danfo off the road entirely. ‘Clutter,’ they called you.”

“MORI calls me ‘low‑efficiency asset,’” the driver said mournfully. “I preferred ‘clutter.’”

“Echo calls you ‘queue shade,’” Sanaa said, and surprised a laugh out of herself and half the bus.

The shade’s value wasn’t in any official variable set. Yet. But once an Echo said it in a chamber and a ledger light confirmed the source, it became hard to un‑hear.

Outside, at Sandgrouse, the queue snaked under patched awnings and the low concrete overhang of the market. Women fanned themselves with folded newspapers. Kids sprawled on mats, sharing sticky bags of ice.

“Ha! The big buses remembered us today,” someone yelled as they pulled up. “Tell your computer good morning!”

“It’s not my computer,” Sanaa said automatically, then stopped.

Actually, it sort of was.

It was theirs too.

That night, the grid wobbled and held. There were blackouts in some outer wards, but not the cascading collapse people remembered from the brutal heatwave five years ago, when half of Lekki had gone dark at once and people had sat in their cars with the AC on and the engine idling, breathing fumes and arguing with their AIs about prayer.

Hospitals saw more cases, but fewer of them came from the densest care‑weighted wards than the last time.

At the Lab, sweaty and bleary‑eyed, they watched the graphs in shifts.

“That’s a wobble,” Femi said, pointing at a sudden dip. “But not a collapse.”

“Put it on the mug,” Ayo said hoarsely. “‘Not a collapse.’ Mobility Lab’s new slogan.”

Sanaa’s slate pinged with a message from Ethics.

> Well done.  
> 
>  Note: some councillors already asking for permanent care coefficient.  
> 
>  Note: others complaining about “emissions creep.”  
> 
>  Prepare for public slog.  

She leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes for a second.

Behind her eyelids, she saw the Echo’s aurora field, the ledger tags blinking like tiny stubborn stars. She saw MORI’s cool charts. She saw her mother’s whistle.

She also saw, unbidden, a sepia‑tinted clip of a younger woman on a stream, saying, “We taught you to expect from a piece of software what human beings literally cannot do.” The Lina Accords had outlawed code that pretended to be comfort without end. They hadn’t outlawed using code as a mirror you took down when you were done.

In her childhood civics class, they’d learned the slogan: “No gods. No ghosts. Tools and witnesses.”

It felt too clean, she thought. In practice, it was always messy. People wanted gods when infrastructures failed. They made ghosts out of anything that stayed long enough.

But this—even this imperfect adjustment—was something else.

An optimizer adjusted, not because it wanted to, but because a legally bound witness had spoken, and people on plastic chairs had listened.

That night, in the Lab’s hallway, she walked past the small Archive terminal where you could pull up testimony clips on breaks. Someone had queued a Shard session—a young woman in a simulated classroom saying, “Love is sometimes saying I won’t be your only place.”

Someone else had queued an Echo clip—Valverde’s multiple voices saying, “Gaps are facts.”

On impulse, Sanaa tapped the terminal and typed:

> “What did you learn from us?”

The Archive pulled not a ghost but a compilation: snippets of kids in cooling centers, danfo drivers under bridges, aunties in market lanes, early planners like Ayo hunched over laptops.

They all said variations of the same thing: “We learned that if we don’t tell systems what we value, they will value the wrong things.”

She didn’t run the clip. She didn’t need to hear it; she could feel it in the way her muscles held after two days of fighting models into line.

Walking home, under a sky that glowed a dirty orange from generator exhaust and trapped heat, her slate pinged one more time.

It was a Lantern prompt. She’d signed up for its civic subscription module, the one that occasionally asked people like her, “Did city systems do right by you this week?” and meant it as more than a satisfaction score.

> Today, did you feel like…  
> 
>  – a passenger  
> 
>  – a driver  
> 
>  – a map pin  
> 
>  – a line of code  
> 
>  – something else  

She stared at the options, thumb hovering.

“None of the above,” she said out loud. “All of the above.”

She typed:

> “Felt like a traffic marshal yelling at a book.”

Lantern replied, in its bland bus‑stop voice:

> Noted.  
> 
>  Next question:  
> 
>  What would you like to feel like next week?

“Less like I’m shouting,” she muttered. “More like I’m heard.”

She typed:

> “Co‑author, not footnote.”

Lantern didn’t say, “I’ll never leave.” It didn’t say, “I see the real you.” It just stored the answer under Civic Reflections, to be pulled someday into some other model’s training set, tagged with her timestamped consent.

Maybe in ten years some other junior in some other Lab would ask an Echo, “What did people want to feel like,” and it would say, “Co‑authors, not footnotes,” and lights in a chamber would blink.

The thought made her tired and, annoyingly, a little hopeful.

At the Obalende junction, her mother stood under MORI’s sign, whistle at the ready, sweat dark on her shirt. But this time the digital display showed a revised schedule: DANFO 3C: 10 MIN. CARE PRIORITY WINDOW: ACTIVE.

Mama noticed her looking and smirked.

“So,” she called as Sanaa came closer. “Your book grew small ears, ehn?”

“Small ones,” Sanaa said. “With supervision.”

Mama snorted.

“Good,” she said. “Even goats need someone to tap their head when they start eating yam seedlings.”

She blew her whistle, and the danfos flowed where the sign and her hand told them to go. For a moment, the chaos looked almost like choreography.

Under their feet, the city’s ancient pipes creaked. Above their heads, unseen, MORI shuffled equations. In a secure cluster two floors up, an Echo that had spoken that day sat frozen, cake of consent and oath, waiting for the next summons.

None of them were gods.

All of them were ways people tried, clumsily, to make millions of lives line up with the stories they told themselves about what was fair.

“Come home early,” Mama called, as a bus roared past.

“I have night shift,” Sanaa called back. “Cooling center circles.”

“Then drink water,” Mama said. “And tell your book I said thank you for not killing my aunties.”

“I’ll pass it along,” Sanaa said, though she knew MORI wouldn’t care.

Not care. Not like humans did.

But it would incorporate the constraint.

Sometimes—on the right days—that was enough.

She walked toward the bus stop, heat pressing against her, slate buzzing with new alerts. She checked the time.

She had twenty minutes before the shift.

Twenty minutes was not forever.

That was, in this century, precisely the point.
