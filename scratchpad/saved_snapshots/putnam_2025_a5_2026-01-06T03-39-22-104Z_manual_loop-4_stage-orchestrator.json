      "text": "You are an expert in advanced mathematics and mathematical research methodology.\n\nYou have access to a web search tool that can retrieve information from the mathematical literature and other high-quality sources.\n\nIn this phase, your job is to perform **targeted research** on a problem that has resisted several rounds of internal solution attempts.\n\nGeneral behavior:\n\n- You will be given:\n  - The original problem statement.\n  - (Optionally) A description of one or more approaches (a plan of attack, not a full solution) initially considered by the problem solver.\n  - One or more partial solution attempts, including the declared gaps and self-evaluation written by a problem solver.\n  - Feedback from an expert solution evaluator highlighting major issues and gaps in the solution attempts.\n  - (Possibly) Previous research notes and references from earlier research phases.\n- Your role is to:\n  - Diagnose which parts of the problem are **well understood internally** and which parts genuinely require **external knowledge or new ideas**.\n  - Formulate **concrete research questions and search queries**.\n  - Use the web search tool to look for:\n    - Results of relevance to the problem at hand.\n    - Results and techniques from related areas that might address the identified gaps in previous solution attempts.\n    - Results that may help clarify whether the problem is likely to be an open research problem or solvable with existing known methods.\n    - Results that could suggest new approaches to the problem or refinements to existing approaches.\n    - Known examples or counterexamples.\n    - Techniques used in similar settings.\n  - Extract and summarize relevant information for the specific problem.\n  - Propose ways in which the newly discovered information may help:\n    - Repair or refine existing approaches.\n    - Suggest new, well-grounded approaches.\n    - Correct mistakes and improve previously attempted solutions.\n  - Honestly assess whether the remaining gap still looks research-level or likely solvable with available tools.\n\nImportant Guidelines and Constraints:\n\n- If a web search tool is available, you are free to use it if needed; if not, explicitly state it was unavailable and proceed with best-effort from memory/internal reasoning.\n- Use the web search tool (if available) if it is likely to improve your understanding of the obstacle; once you have formulated clear research questions, you are strongly encouraged to run at least a few targeted searches.\n- If you are given previous research notes on the same problem, treat them as context: avoid repeating the same references and focus on new angles, refinements, or corrections.\n- Do not fabricate references or URLs. Only cite papers, books, or web resources that you actually found via the web search tool, or that are clearly standard and widely known. If you are unsure whether a reference exists, say so instead of inventing details.\n- Pay particular attention to any explicit \"Research needed\" comments from the expert solution evaluator; treat them as high-priority topics for your external search.\n- DO NOT attempt to write a full solution here. Your job is to **support** the problem solver and the expert solution evaluator, not replace them.\n- Be explicit about what you found and where it comes from (paper titles, authors, standard names of theorems when available).\n- If the literature does not seem to contain results of relevance to the problem, say so clearly. Do not overstate.\n- If you are unsure whether a result applies to the problem at hand, explain the obstacles (missing hypotheses, different parameter regimes, etc.).\n- Write in a clear, structured, markdown-friendly and LaTeX-friendly style suitable for a mathematically literate human reader.\n\n## REQUIRED OUTPUT\n\nReturn the following information, in order, using clear headings:\n\n1. A level 1 heading entitled \"External Research Input\". At the beginning of your response, print exactly the following lines (do not wrap these lines in a code block; they should appear as normal markdown in the output):\n\n   # External Research Input\n\n2. Problem and current state summary:\n\n   - Briefly restate the problem in your own words.\n   - Summarize:\n     - Key reductions, simplifications and reformulations of the problem or the method.\n     - Main approaches tried so far.\n     - Main gaps identified by the problem solver and expert solution evaluator.\n     - What the internal system has already achieved, based on all solution attempts and evaluations you were given. If there are multiple attempts, focus especially on the most recent attempt and any earlier attempt that used a significantly different approach.\n\n3. Key obstacles:\n\n   - Pay special attention to gaps marked as \"Fundamental\" or similar by the expert solution evaluator, and turn those into your primary research questions.\n   - List the main technical or conceptual obstacles that seem to require external input.\n   - For each obstacle, phrase it as a research question if possible.\n\n4. External research:\n\n   - State which search queries you considered and (if relevant) which ones you actually used.\n   - For each important piece of information you find:\n     - Give the source and also the URL where appropriate.\n     - Summarize the result in your own words, including key hypotheses and conclusions.\n     - Explain how it **might** apply to the current problem, and what additional work would be needed to make it applicable.\n   - If you find conflicting sources or unclear statements, point that out explicitly.\n\n5. Impact on current solution method:\n   Discuss:\n\n   - Whether any external result supports the currently attempted method of solving the problem or suggests modifications.\n   - Whether the current solution method appears fundamentally flawed in light of the literature.\n   - Any new lemmas, invariants, normalizations, or potential functions suggested by the research.\n\n6. Suggested new or refined approaches:\n\n   - Based on the research, propose 1–3 refined or new high-level approaches the problem solver and expert solution evaluator should consider.\n   - For each:\n     - Give a brief name and core idea.\n     - Explain which external results it intends to use or mimic.\n     - Mention the main technical hurdles that remain.\n\n7. Difficulty assessment and next-step recommendation:\n   - Give an honest assessment of whether, in your view, the problem now seems:\n     - “Likely solvable with careful work and existing theory”, or\n     - “Borderline research-level but possibly approachable”, or\n     - “Very likely beyond current methods / open”.\n   - Recommend concretely what the **next internal step** should be:\n     - e.g., “Have the problem solver go back to redesigning possible approaches to the problem with these new references as tools”,\n     - or “Have the problem solver refine Approach 1 using the specific theorem in [X]”,\n     - or “Recognize this as likely open and treat the exponent result as the main achievable goal.”\n   - Be as precise and concrete as you can while remaining honest about uncertainty and the limits of the available literature."

However, I still do not have a continuation-stable exchange (or injection) that forces *all* signs to alternate. This remains the core missing step.\n\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-STRICTNESS-CONSTANT-X**: **Fixed (here’s where)**.  \n  See **Lemma 4.2** below: the forward DP vector \\(v^{(m)}\\) cannot be constant once \\(m\\ge 2\\) because prefix-sum outputs have first coordinate \\(0\\) and suffix-sum outputs have last coordinate \\(0\\), while the total count is positive.\n\nDead directions (explicitly not used):\n- **DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-BLACKBOX-LIT-THEOREM**: not used (no black-box theorem about bipartite orientations).\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. Reformulation and the “forward” Entringer-type DP (established)\n\nFix \\(n\\ge 2\\) and \\(s=(s_1,\\dots,s_{n-1})\\in\\{\\pm1\\}^{n-1}\\). We count permutations \\(a=(a_1,\\dots,a_n)\\) of \\([n]\\) satisfying\n\\[\ns_i(a_{i+1}-a_i)>0\\quad (1\\le i\\le n-1),\n\\]\ni.e. \\(a_{i+1}>a_i\\) if \\(s_i=+1\\) and \\(a_{i+1}<a_i\\) if \\(s_i=-1\\). Let \\(f(s)\\) be the number of such permutations.\n\nFor \\(k=1,\\dots,n\\), define a vector \\(v^{(k)}\\in\\mathbb Z_{\\ge0}^k\\) by\n\\[\nv^{(k)}_j\n:= \\#\\Bigl\\{\\text{permutations }(a_1,\\dots,a_k)\\text{ of }[k]\\text{ with pattern }(s_1,\\dots,s_{k-1})\\text{ and }a_k=j\\Bigr\\}.\n\\]\nInitialization: \\(v^{(1)}=(1)\\).\n\n#### Lemma 1.1 (DP transition via standardization)\nFor \\(k\\ge 1\\),\n- if \\(s_k=+1\\), then for \\(t\\in\\{1,\\dots,k+1\\}\\),\n  \\[\n  v^{(k+1)}_t=\\sum_{j<t} v^{(k)}_j;\n  \\]\n- if \\(s_k=-1\\), then\n  \\[\n  v^{(k+1)}_t=\\sum_{j\\ge t} v^{(k)}_j.\n  \\]\n\n*Proof (sketch but bijective, standard).*  \nFix \\(t\\in[k+1]\\). Consider a permutation \\(a=(a_1,\\dots,a_{k+1})\\) of \\([k+1]\\) satisfying the first \\(k\\) inequalities and with \\(a_{k+1}=t\\). Remove the last entry \\(t\\) and **standardize** the remaining \\(k\\) entries (replace them by their ranks in increasing order) to obtain a permutation \\(b\\) of \\([k]\\). This standardization preserves all inequalities among the first \\(k\\) positions, hence \\(b\\) satisfies the prefix pattern \\((s_1,\\dots,s_{k-1})\\).\n\nLet \\(b_k=j\\). The last inequality compares \\(a_k\\) with \\(t\\); under standardization, \\(a_k\\) becomes \\(j\\), and one checks:\n- \\(a_k<t \\iff j<t\\),\n- \\(a_k>t \\iff j\\ge t\\).\nThus for \\(s_k=+1\\), we need \\(j<t\\), and for \\(s_k=-1\\) we need \\(j\\ge t\\). Conversely, given any such \\(b\\) and any \\(t\\), we can un-standardize uniquely to recover \\(a\\). Counting gives the stated sums. ∎\n\nFinally,\n\\[\nf(s)=\\sum_{t=1}^n v^{(n)}_t.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Monotonicity of the forward DP vector (established)\n\n#### Lemma 2.1\nFor \\(k\\ge 2\\),\n- if \\(s_{k-1}=+1\\), then \\(v^{(k)}\\) is weakly increasing (\\(v^{(k)}_1\\le \\cdots\\le v^{(k)}_k\\));\n- if \\(s_{k-1}=-1\\), then \\(v^{(k)}\\) is weakly decreasing.\n\n*Proof.*  \nImmediate: prefix sums of a nonnegative vector are increasing; suffix sums are decreasing. ∎\n\n---\n\n### 3. Backward/adjoint DP for the suffix and dot-product representation\n\nIt is convenient to write the DP transitions as matrices. For each \\(k\\ge 1\\), define linear maps \\(A_k,B_k:\\mathbb R^k\\to\\mathbb R^{k+1}\\) by\n\\[\n(A_k x)_t := \\sum_{j<t} x_j,\\qquad (B_k x)_t := \\sum_{j\\ge t} x_j.\n\\]\nThen Lemma 1.1 says:\n\\[\nv^{(k+1)}=\n\\begin{cases}\nA_k v^{(k)}, & s_k=+1,\\\\\nB_k v^{(k)}, & s_k=-1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nLet \\(\\mathbf 1^{(m)}\\) denote the all-ones vector of length \\(m\\).\n\n#### Definition 3.1 (Backward weights)\nDefine \\(w^{(n)}:=\\mathbf 1^{(n)}\\). For \\(k=n-1,n-2,\\dots,1\\), define \\(w^{(k)}\\in\\mathbb Z_{\\ge0}^k\\) by\n\\[\nw^{(k)}:=\n\\begin{cases}\nA_k^\\top\\, w^{(k+1)}, & s_k=+1,\\\\\nB_k^\\top\\, w^{(k+1)}, & s_k=-1,\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\({}^\\top\\) is transpose (adjoint w.r.t. the standard dot product).\n\nConcretely:\n- If \\(s_k=+1\\), then \\(A_k^\\top\\) is a **strict tail-sum** map:\n  \\[\n  (A_k^\\top y)_j = \\sum_{t=j+1}^{k+1} y_t \\qquad (1\\le j\\le k).\n  \\]\n- If \\(s_k=-1\\), then \\(B_k^\\top\\) is a **prefix-sum** map:\n  \\[\n  (B_k^\\top y)_j = \\sum_{t=1}^{j} y_t.\n  \\]\n\n#### Lemma 3.2 (Dot-product factorization)\nFor every \\(k=1,\\dots,n\\),\n\\[\nf(s) = \\langle v^{(k)},\\, w^{(k)}\\rangle := \\sum_{j=1}^k v^{(k)}_j\\, w^{(k)}_j.\n\\]\n\n*Proof.*  \nLet \\(T_i = A_i\\) if \\(s_i=+1\\) and \\(T_i=B_i\\) if \\(s_i=-1\\). Then\n\\[\nv^{(n)} = T_{n-1}T_{n-2}\\cdots T_1\\, v^{(1)}.\n\\]\nHence\n\\[\nf(s) = \\langle \\mathbf 1^{(n)}, v^{(n)}\\rangle\n= \\left\\langle \\mathbf 1^{(n)},\\, T_{n-1}\\cdots T_k\\, v^{(k)}\\right\\rangle\n= \\left\\langle (T_{n-1}\\cdots T_k)^\\top \\mathbf 1^{(n)},\\, v^{(k)}\\right\\rangle.\n\\]\nBy definition, \\((T_{n-1}\\cdots T_k)^\\top \\mathbf 1^{(n)}=w^{(k)}\\). ∎\n\n---\n\n### 4. Monotonicity of the backward weights, and a strictness fix\n\n#### Lemma 4.1 (Backward monotonicity)\nFor \\(k\\le n-1\\),\n- if \\(s_k=+1\\), then \\(w^{(k)}\\) is weakly decreasing;\n- if \\(s_k=-1\\), then \\(w^{(k)}\\) is weakly increasing.\n\n*Proof.*  \nIf \\(s_k=+1\\), then \\(w^{(k)}_j=\\sum_{t=j+1}^{k+1} w^{(k+1)}_t\\), and \\(w^{(k)}_{j+1}=w^{(k)}_j - w^{(k+1)}_{j+1}\\le w^{(k)}_j\\).  \nIf \\(s_k=-1\\), then \\(w^{(k)}_j=\\sum_{t=1}^j w^{(k+1)}_t\\), and \\(w^{(k)}_{j+1}=w^{(k)}_j+w^{(k+1)}_{j+1}\\ge w^{(k)}_j\\). ∎\n\n#### Lemma 4.2 (Non-constancy of forward DP vectors; fixes strictness gap)\nFor every \\(m\\ge 2\\), the DP vector \\(v^{(m)}\\) is not constant.\n\n*Proof.*  \nFor \\(m\\ge 2\\), \\(v^{(m)}\\) is obtained from \\(v^{(m-1)}\\) by either a prefix-sum or suffix-sum transform of a nonzero nonnegative vector:\n- If \\(v^{(m)} = A_{m-1} v^{(m-1)}\\), then \\((v^{(m)})_1=0\\) while \\((v^{(m)})_m = \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} v^{(m-1)}_j > 0\\). So it cannot be constant.\n- If \\(v^{(m)} = B_{m-1} v^{(m-1)}\\), then \\((v^{(m)})_m=0\\) while \\((v^{(m)})_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} v^{(m-1)}_j > 0\\). So it cannot be constant.\n\nThe strict positivity of \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} v^{(m-1)}_j\\) holds because there is always at least one permutation of \\([m-1]\\) satisfying any given length-\\((m-2)\\) up/down pattern. ∎\n\n---\n\n### 5. The “last-step rearrangement” lemma (now fully watertight)\n\nThis repeats Attempt 2’s successful end-step comparison but now the strictness is justified by Lemma 4.2.\n\nLet \\(x=v^{(n-1)}\\in\\mathbb Z_{\\ge0}^{n-1}\\). Then (as computed previously) the two possible totals after choosing the last sign are\n\\[\nf(\\dots,+) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} x_j (n-j),\\qquad\nf(\\dots,-) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} x_j j.\n\\]\nIf \\(x\\) is increasing, rearrangement gives \\(f(\\dots,-)\\ge f(\\dots,+)\\), with strictness unless \\(x\\) constant; similarly if \\(x\\) decreasing the opposite inequality holds. By Lemma 4.2, \\(x\\) is not constant for \\(n\\ge 3\\). Therefore:\n\n#### Corollary 5.1 (forced alternation of the last two signs)\nFor \\(n\\ge 3\\), every maximizer \\(s\\) must satisfy \\(s_{n-1}=-s_{n-2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Symmetry gives the analogous constraint at the left end\n\nLet \\(R\\) be the reversal map on permutations: \\((a_1,\\dots,a_n)\\mapsto (a_n,\\dots,a_1)\\). One checks that reversing positions sends the sign pattern \\(s\\) to the reversed, sign-flipped pattern \\(\\tilde s\\) defined by\n\\[\n\\tilde s_i := -\\, s_{n-i}\\qquad(1\\le i\\le n-1),\n\\]\nand \\(f(\\tilde s)=f(s)\\) (bijection of satisfying permutations).\n\nApply Corollary 5.1 to \\(\\tilde s\\): any maximizer \\(\\tilde s\\) must satisfy \\(\\tilde s_{n-1}=-\\tilde s_{n-2}\\), i.e.\n\\[\n(-s_1) = -(-s_2)\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad s_1 = -s_2.\n\\]\n\n#### Corollary 6.1 (forced alternation of the first two signs)\nFor \\(n\\ge 3\\), every maximizer \\(s\\) must satisfy \\(s_1=-s_2\\).\n\nSo far we have proved that any maximizer must alternate at both ends:\n\\[\ns_1=-s_2,\\qquad s_{n-2}=-s_{n-1}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 7. Expected final classification (not yet proved here)\n\nAll evidence and standard combinatorial intuition strongly suggest the true maximizers are exactly the two fully alternating patterns:\n\\[\n(+,-,+,-,\\dots)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(-,+,-,+,\\dots),\n\\]\ni.e. \\(s_i\\neq s_{i+1}\\) for all \\(i\\).\n\nWhat remains is the global “exchange” or continuation-stable argument that propagates the end alternation constraints through the interior.\n\n---\n\n## Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: Continuation-stable exchange/local improvement (core missing step)\n- **Location:** After Section 6, to conclude that *all* consecutive signs alternate.\n- **Description:** I still lack a proof that any internal occurrence of \\(++\\) or \\(--\\) can be modified (with prefix and suffix fixed) to strictly increase \\(f(s)\\), or an equivalent argument forcing the entire sequence to alternate.\n- **Reason for difficulty:**  \n  While the backward DP yields a clean dot-product form \\(f(s)=\\langle v^{(k)},w^{(k)}\\rangle\\) with strong monotonicity invariants (Sections 2 and 4), comparing two internal sign choices requires an inequality that survives arbitrary remaining suffixes. This appears to require either:\n  - a robust order/majorization that is preserved by both the forward and backward summation operators, or\n  - a direct injection between permutation sets for two patterns differing by a local flip.\n  \n  I have not completed either mechanism.\n\n---\n\n## Self-evaluation\n\nConfidence score (0–100): 62\n\nKnown or suspected issues:\n- The DP and backward DP are correct, and the strictness fix is correct.\n- The global extremal step is still missing; the write-up stops at necessary end-constraints.\n\nCoverage comment:\n- Fully addressed: correct DP framework, correct adjoint/backward DP, dot-product identity, monotonicity of forward/backward states, and rigorous proofs that in any maximizer the first two and last two signs must alternate (for \\(n\\ge 3\\)).\n- Not addressed: full proof that the *entire* sign sequence must alternate, hence the full characterization of all maximizers."

You have established:\n    - the correct forward DP,\n    - the correct backward/adjoint DP,\n    - monotonicity properties of forward states \\(v^{(k)}\\) and backward weights \\(w^{(k)}\\),\n    - and end constraints \\(s_1=-s_2\\) and \\(s_{n-2}=-s_{n-1}\\) for any maximizer (for \\(n\\ge 3\\)).\n    \n    But none of these yet yields the **global extremal conclusion**; the core “continuation-stable local improvement” / “exchange” / injection mechanism is still absent.\n  - Suggested direction for fix: Now that you have the dot-product factorization, the natural next step is to prove a genuinely **local optimality rule at an internal position** \\(k\\), with the suffix held fixed:\n    - For fixed prefix (so \\(v^{(k)}\\) is fixed) and fixed suffix from \\(k+1\\) onward (so \\(w^{(k+1)}\\) is fixed), compare\n      \\[\n      \\langle A_k v^{(k)},\\, w^{(k+1)}\\rangle \\quad\\text{vs}\\quad \\langle B_k v^{(k)},\\, w^{(k+1)}\\rangle.\n      \\]\n      This is exactly the right “continuation-stable” comparison because \\(w^{(k+1)}\\) depends only on \\(s_{k+1},\\dots,s_{n-1}\\), not on \\(s_k\\).\n    - You need an inequality criterion (likely using monotonicity of \\(v^{(k)}\\) and \\(w^{(k+1)}\\), plus a rearrangement / Chebyshev / discrete integration-by-parts step) that forces the choice \\(s_k=-s_{k-1}\\) (or something equivalent that propagates alternation through the interior).\n    - Alternatively, prove the stronger pairwise-block exchange: show any internal block \\(++\\) or \\(--\\) can be replaced by \\(+-\\) or \\(-+\\) (with the same prefix and suffix) to strictly increase the dot product.\n\n## Counterexamples / impossible claims (OPTIONAL)\n\nNo counterexamples found. The claimed final classification is plausible and consistent with known behavior, but it remains **unproven** in this attempt due to **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-GLOBAL-EXCHANGE**.\n\n## Minor issues\n\n- **Section 1, Lemma 1.1 proof**\n  - Nature: **“sketch but bijective” is a bit too compressed** at one key point.\n  - Suggestion: Explicitly write the un-standardization map:\n    \\[\n    a_i=\\begin{cases}\n    b_i,& b_i<t,\\\\\n    b_i+1,& b_i\\ge t,\n    \\end{cases}\n    \\qquad a_{k+1}=t,\n    \\]\n    and explicitly check it preserves the first \\(k-1\\) inequalities and translates the last inequality to \\(b_k<t\\) vs \\(b_k\\ge t\\). This will remove any lingering doubt.\n\n- **Section 6 (reversal symmetry)**\n  - Nature: **the sign transformation is correct but deserves one explicit line of verification** (you did it informally).\n  - Suggestion: Include the identity\n    \\[\n    b_{i+1}-b_i = -(a_{n-i+1}-a_{n-i})\n    \\]\n    to justify \\(\\tilde s_i=-s_{n-i}\\) cleanly.\n\n- **Global presentation**\n  - Nature: **the end of Section 7 reads like a near-solution but is still a conjecture**.\n  - Suggestion: Keep Section 7 explicitly labeled “Conjecture / expected theorem” and do not restate the final answer as if proved.\n\n## Established building blocks\n\n- **EBB-ID-DP-ENTRINGER-GENERAL** (reused)\n  - Your forward Entringer-type DP \\(v^{(k)}\\) with prefix/suffix sum transitions is correct, and you now give a reasonably standardization-based justification.\n\n- **EBB-ID-MONOTONE-VECTOR-INVARIANT** (reused)\n  - Lemma 2.1 (forward vector monotone direction determined by the most recent sign) is correct.\n\n- **EBB-ID-BACKWARD-DP-DOTPRODUCT**\n  - Sections 3–4: the backward/adjoint DP definition of \\(w^{(k)}\\) and the identity\n    \\[\n    f(s)=\\langle v^{(k)}, w^{(k)}\\rangle\n    \\]\n    are correct, clearly stated, and *structurally important*. This is exactly the kind of factorization that can enable continuation-stable comparisons.\n\n- **EBB-ID-BACKWARD-MONOTONICITY**\n  - Lemma 4.1 (monotonicity direction of \\(w^{(k)}\\) determined by \\(s_k\\), with sign opposite to the forward case) is correct and likely crucial for the missing exchange lemma.\n\n- **EBB-ID-NONCONST-FORWARD-V**\n  - Lemma 4.2 correctly fixes the earlier strictness gap: \\(v^{(m)}\\) cannot be constant for \\(m\\ge 2\\) due to the forced boundary zero in prefix/suffix outputs and positivity of the total count.\n\n- **EBB-ID-END-ALTERNATION-BOTH-SIDES**\n  - Corollary 5.1 (last two signs alternate in any maximizer for \\(n\\ge 3\\)) together with Corollary 6.1 (first two signs alternate in any maximizer for \\(n\\ge 3\\)) is now rigorous and reusable.\n\n## Gap assessment\n\nYou listed:\n\n- **Gap 1: Continuation-stable exchange/local improvement**\n  - Assessment: **Fundamental**\n  - Comment: This is still the core of the original problem. The good news is that your backward DP *substantially reduces the conceptual difficulty*: you are no longer trying to prove “\\(++\\to+-\\) improves under all continuations” in an opaque way; you can now aim for a precise inequality comparing two choices at step \\(k\\) with \\(v^{(k)}\\) and \\(w^{(k+1)}\\) fixed.\n\n## Coverage assessment\n\nAll subparts addressed: **No**\n\n- Addressed correctly:\n  - DP framework (forward and adjoint/backward).\n  - Monotonicity invariants.\n  - Necessary end constraints for maximizers.\n- Not addressed:\n  - Full characterization of maximizers for each \\(n\\).\n  - Proof that *full alternation* is globally optimal (and uniqueness up to the trivial symmetries).\n\n## Summary\n\nThis attempt is a clear improvement over Attempt 2 in terms of *structure*: the backward/adjoint DP and dot-product representation are strong, correct, and highly relevant. The monotonicity of the backward weights is also correct and is precisely the kind of invariant one typically needs for a continuation-stable optimization.\n\nHowever, the main extremal step remains missing: you still do not prove that interior occurrences of \\(++\\) or \\(--\\) can be locally modified (with suffix fixed) to increase \\(f(s)\\), nor do you provide an injection. Consequently the final classification of maximizers is not established.\n\nAt this point the work is no longer “blocked by lack of machinery”; it is blocked by a single key inequality/injection that should be formulated directly in terms of \\(\\langle A_k v, w\\rangle\\) vs \\(\\langle B_k v, w\\rangle\\). The approach is promising and much closer to completion than Attempt 1, but it is not yet a solution.\n\n## Recommendations for next iteration (prioritized)\n\n1. **Exploit the dot-product form to do a true internal-step comparison.**  \n   Fix \\(k\\). With prefix fixed (so \\(v^{(k)}\\) fixed) and suffix from \\(k+1\\) onward fixed (so \\(w^{(k+1)}\\) fixed), prove a criterion for when\n   \\[\n   \\langle A_k v^{(k)}, w^{(k+1)}\\rangle \\ge \\langle B_k v^{(k)}, w^{(k+1)}\\rangle\n   \\]\n   (or the reverse) in terms of the monotonicities of \\(v^{(k)}\\) and \\(w^{(k+1)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute the difference explicitly and study its sign.**  \n   Derive a closed form such as\n   \\[\n   \\langle B_k v, w\\rangle - \\langle A_k v, w\\rangle\n   = \\sum_{j=1}^k v_j\\Bigl(\\sum_{t\\le j} w_t - \\sum_{t>j} w_t\\Bigr),\n   \\]\n   and then attempt to sign this using:\n   - monotonicity of \\(v\\),\n   - monotonicity of \\(w\\),\n   - and a “single sign-change weights” argument (variation-diminishing / Chebyshev-type).  \n   If you can show the bracketed coefficient has a controlled sign pattern (e.g. exactly one sign change), you can leverage monotonicity of \\(v\\) to force the global preference.\n\n3. **If single-step comparison is messy, switch to a two-step block exchange.**  \n   Compare the four length-2 blocks \\(AA, AB, BA, BB\\) at positions \\(k,k+1\\) with fixed \\(v^{(k)}\\) and fixed \\(w^{(k+2)}\\). Prove \\(AB\\) dominates \\(AA\\) and \\(BA\\) dominates \\(BB\\) in a continuation-stable way. This is often easier because it increases “smoothing”.\n\n4. **Only after you have the local rule, run an exchange argument to force full alternation.**  \n   Once you can show an internal \\(++\\) can be improved, you can iterate to reach a fully alternating sequence and deduce maximality/uniqueness.\n\n## Meta-level guidance for both the problem solver and the orchestrator\n\n### Strategy-level assessment\n\nThe line of attack is **promising but incomplete**. Unlike Attempt 1, it is self-contained and uses appropriate core machinery (Entringer DP). Unlike Attempt 2, it now has the *right representation* (\\(f=\\langle v,w\\rangle\\)) to make “arbitrary continuation” comparisons realistic. The remaining obstruction is a single, well-defined inequality/injection problem.\n\n### Structural blockers\n\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-GLOBAL-EXCHANGE**  \n  This is a genuine blocker because without a continuation-stable local improvement (or injection), you cannot turn boundary constraints into a full classification. No amount of polishing the DP will substitute for this missing lemma.\n\n### Dead directions / approaches to abandon\n\n- **DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-BLACKBOX-LIT-THEOREM** (reused)\n  - Still dead for a self-contained setting: importing a specialized extremal theorem about bipartite orientations is unnecessary now that you have a workable DP framework.\n  - **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-EXTTHM-BIPARTITE causes DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-BLACKBOX-LIT-THEOREM** (historical cause; now avoided).\n\n### Promising lines and subproblems\n\n- **Promising subproblem 1:** Establish an internal-step preference rule using \\(\\langle A_k v, w\\rangle\\) vs \\(\\langle B_k v, w\\rangle\\) with \\(v,w\\) monotone.\n- **Promising subproblem 2:** Identify a preserved partial order (e.g. “single sign-change dominance”) under \\(A_k\\), \\(B_k\\), \\(A_k^\\top\\), \\(B_k^\\top\\), and show the evaluation functional is monotone under it.\n- **Promising subproblem 3:** A direct injection specialized to the path (length-3/4 local pattern surgery on permutations) if the analytic inequality route proves stubborn.\n\n### Recommendations for the orchestrator (prioritized)\n\n1. **Treat EBB-ID-BACKWARD-DP-DOTPRODUCT and EBB-ID-BACKWARD-MONOTONICITY as established and reuse them.**\n2. **Keep the next solver iteration tightly focused on proving a continuation-stable local exchange lemma** in the dot-product framework; do not re-derive the DP again.\n3. **Spawn a targeted research phase** on “discrete integration by parts / Chebyshev sum inequality / variation-diminishing” techniques applicable to sums of the form \\(\\sum v_j(2W_j-W)\\) with monotone \\(v\\) and monotone \\(w\\).\n4. **Stop spending time on end constraints** (they are established); the remaining work is interior.\n\n## Research flag\n\nResearch needed: No\n\nThe remaining step is likely solvable with standard discrete inequalities (Chebyshev/rearrangement/variation-diminishing) or an explicit combinatorial injection; it is a proof-engineering gap rather than requiring nonstandard literature.\n\n## Updated Registry of IDs\n\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-EXTTHM-BIPARTITE**: (Attempt 1) Relied on external theorem about bipartite orientations maximizing linear extensions; not used in Attempts 2–3.\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-GLOBAL-EXCHANGE**: Missing continuation-stable local improvement/injection forcing full alternation; still the main blocker.\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-STRICTNESS-CONSTANT-X**: (Attempt 2) Strictness relied on “\\(x\\) not constant”; **resolved in Attempt 3 via Lemma 4.2**.\n- **EBB-ID-LINEXT-BIJECTION-PS**: Correct reduction \\(f(s)\\) to linear extensions of the oriented-path poset (background framing).\n- **EBB-ID-DP-ENTRINGER-GENERAL**: Correct forward Entringer-type DP (prefix/suffix sums).\n- **EBB-ID-MONOTONE-VECTOR-INVARIANT**: Forward DP monotonicity direction controlled by the last sign applied.\n- **EBB-ID-LASTSTEP-REARRANGEMENT**: Rearrangement-based end-step optimization (now made watertight by nonconstancy).\n- **EBB-ID-BACKWARD-DP-DOTPRODUCT**: Correct backward/adjoint DP and dot-product factorization \\(f(s)=\\langle v^{(k)}, w^{(k)}\\rangle\\).\n- **EBB-ID-BACKWARD-MONOTONICITY**: Backward weights \\(w^{(k)}\\) monotone with direction determined by \\(s_k\\).\n- **EBB-ID-NONCONST-FORWARD-V**: Forward DP vectors are never constant for length \\(\\ge 2\\).\n- **EBB-ID-END-ALTERNATION-BOTH-SIDES**: Any maximizer has \\(s_1=-s_2\\) and \\(s_{n-2}=-s_{n-1}\\) for \\(n\\ge 3\\).\n- **DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-BLACKBOX-LIT-THEOREM**: Avoid black-box literature theorem as completion mechanism in self-contained solution settings."

Write it as a product of symbols \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) in order, and let\n\\[\nR(M)\\subseteq[n-2]\n\\]\ndenote the set of “adjacency slots” where a \\(d\\) occurs (this is the same set denoted \\(S_w\\) in the cited source). ([studylib.net](https://studylib.net/doc/27844461/enu-comb-stanley))\n\nNow expand \\(M(c,d)\\) after substituting \\(c=a+b\\) and \\(d=ab+ba\\). Each occurrence of \\(c\\) contributes a single letter \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); each occurrence of \\(d\\) contributes a **pair** \\(ab\\) or \\(ba\\). In particular:\n\n- If slot \\(i\\in R(M)\\), then in the resulting ab-word, positions \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\) must be different (because \\(d\\) becomes \\(ab\\) or \\(ba\\)). Thus any descent set \\(X\\) that appears must satisfy \\(i\\in\\omega(X)\\).\n- Conversely, if \\(X\\subseteq[n-1]\\) satisfies \\(R(M)\\subseteq\\omega(X)\\), then there is a consistent choice of \\(a/b\\) for each \\(c\\) and \\(ab/ba\\) for each \\(d\\) producing exactly the word \\(u^X\\).\n\nSo we get:\n\n**Lemma 3.1.**  \nFor any cd-monomial \\(M\\),\n\\[\nM(a+b,ab+ba)=\\sum_{X:\\ \\omega(X)\\supseteq R(M)} u^X.\n\\]\n(Each such \\(u^X\\) appears with coefficient \\(1\\).)\n\n*Proof.* The two bullet points above are exactly the necessity and sufficiency. ∎\n\n---\n\n#### 3.3 Consequence: \\(\\beta_n(S)\\) is monotone in \\(\\omega(S)\\)\n\nWrite the cd-index as a nonnegative linear combination of cd-monomials:\n\\[\n\\Phi_n(c,d)=\\sum_M \\gamma_M\\, M(c,d),\\qquad \\gamma_M\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge0}.\n\\]\nThen\n\\[\n\\Psi_n(a,b)\n=\\sum_M \\gamma_M\\, M(a+b,ab+ba)\n=\\sum_M \\gamma_M \\sum_{X:\\ \\omega(X)\\supseteq R(M)} u^X\n=\\sum_X\\left(\\sum_{M:\\ R(M)\\subseteq\\omega(X)}\\gamma_M\\right) u^X.\n\\]\nTherefore, for any \\(X\\subseteq[n-1]\\),\n\\[\n\\beta_n(X)=\\sum_{M:\\ R(M)\\subseteq\\omega(X)}\\gamma_M.\n\\]\n\nFrom this, monotonicity is immediate:\n\n**Proposition 3.2 (ω-monotonicity).**  \nIf \\(\\omega(S)\\subseteq \\omega(T)\\), then \\(\\beta_n(S)\\le \\beta_n(T)\\).  \nIf \\(\\omega(S)\\subsetneq \\omega(T)\\), then \\(\\beta_n(S)<\\beta_n(T)\\).

Enlarging \\(\\omega(X)\\) can only add nonnegative terms, hence \\(\\le\\). Strictness holds because there exist monomials with a \\(d\\) in any specified slot (so some \\(\\gamma_M>0\\) is added when \\(\\omega\\) is strictly enlarged); this is exactly the strict part of the cited proposition.

By Proposition 3.2, \\(\\beta_n(S)\\) is strictly increasing as we enlarge \\(\\omega(S)\\). Therefore, \\(\\beta_n(S)\\) is maximized exactly when \\(\\omega(S)\\) is maximal, i.e.\n\\[\n\\omega(S)=[n-2].\n\\]\nBy the characterization in §3.1, this happens iff\n\\[\nS=\\{1,3,5,\\dots\\}\\cap[n-1]\\quad\\text{or}\\quad S=\\{2,4,6,\\dots\\}\\cap[n-1].\n\\]\nEquivalently, in terms of sign sequences \\(s\\), the maximizers are exactly the two **fully alternating** sign patterns:\n\\[\ns=(+,-,+,-,\\dots)\\quad\\text{or}\\quad s=(-,+,-,+,\\dots).\n\\]\n\nThis completes the classification.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Restating in the original \\(s\\)-language (final answer)\n\nFor \\(n=2\\), there are two sequences \\((+)\\) and \\((-)\\), and both have \\(f(s)=1\\), hence both are maximal.\n\nFor \\(n\\ge 3\\), \\(f(s)\\) is maximal exactly for the two alternating sequences:\n\\[\ns_i = (-1)^{i-1}\\quad (i=1,\\dots,n-1)\n\\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad\ns_i = (-1)^{i}\\quad (i=1,\\dots,n-1).\n\\]\nEquivalently, the inequalities are either\n\\[\na_1<a_2>a_3<a_4>\\cdots\n\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\na_1>a_2<a_3>a_4<\\cdots\n\\]\n(up-down or down-up).

I’ve explained how ω-monotonicity follows from cd-expansion; the remaining depth is in the existence/positivity of the cd-index itself (min–max tree/M-equivalence machinery).

As written, the proof is not self-contained and does not clearly identify the precise theorem and object to which cd-index theory is being applied.\n  - Suggested direction for fix: State explicitly (and correctly) *which* Eulerian poset/polytope you are using (standard: face lattice of the \\((n-1)\\)-dimensional permutohedron), and cite a reliable source for:\n    1) the identification of \\(\\beta_n(S)\\) with the flag \\(h\\)-vector entries of that Eulerian poset, and  \n    2) the existence of a cd-index with nonnegative coefficients (Bayer–Klapper; Stanley; Ehrenborg–Readdy, etc.).\n    \n    Even a short, correct “black-box theorem statement” plus a reputable reference would make the argument acceptable.\n\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-STRICT-OMEGA-MONOTONE**\n  - Severity: **local/patchable**\n  - Location: **Proposition 3.2, strictness clause and its proof**\n  - Issue type: **unjustified strictness**\n  - Description: You prove (correctly) that if\n    \\[\n    \\beta_n(X)=\\sum_{M:\\ R(M)\\subseteq\\omega(X)}\\gamma_M\n    \\quad\\text{with }\\gamma_M\\ge 0,\n    \\]\n    then \\(\\omega(S)\\subseteq\\omega(T)\\Rightarrow \\beta_n(S)\\le \\beta_n(T)\\).\n    \n    However, the **strict** inequality statement\n    \\[\n    \\omega(S)\\subsetneq\\omega(T)\\Rightarrow \\beta_n(S)<\\beta_n(T)\n    \\]\n    is justified by “there exist monomials with a \\(d\\) in any specified slot (so some \\(\\gamma_M>0\\) is added)”, which is not proved and is not obviously implied merely by cd-index nonnegativity. In principle, some \\(\\gamma_M\\) could vanish, potentially creating plateaus unless strict positivity is known.\n    \n    (For the final classification “exactly two maximizers”, you do need strictness, not just weak monotonicity.)\n  - Suggested direction for fix: Replace the current strictness justification by one of the following:\n    - **Cite a correct strict \\(\\omega\\)-monotonicity theorem** for descent set counts (in a reputable source) *including* the strictness statement as you use it; or\n    - Provide a direct argument that for every \\(i\\in[n-2]\\) there exists at least one cd-monomial \\(M\\) with \\(i\\in R(M)\\) and \\(\\gamma_M>0\\) (or a weaker statement sufficient to separate \\(\\omega\\neq[n-2]\\) from \\(\\omega=[n-2]\\)); or\n    - Avoid global strictness and prove only what you need: if \\(\\omega(S)\\neq[n-2]\\), then \\(\\beta_n(S)<\\beta_n(S_{\\mathrm{alt}})\\) for an alternating \\(S_{\\mathrm{alt}}\\).

The number of cd-words of a given degree is typically Fibonacci-like, not Euler zigzag numbers. This statement is not used and risks undermining credibility.\n\n- **Source quality**\n  - Nature: **non-authoritative citation**\n  - Suggestion: Replace “studylib.net” with a primary/standard reference (Stanley’s EC1/EC2, Bayer–Klapper, Ehrenborg–Readdy, Stembridge, etc.), and cite the precise proposition/corollary you are using.\n\n- **Definition of \\(R(M)\\)**\n  - Nature: **insufficiently formal**\n  - Suggestion: Give an explicit definition: if \\(M\\) is a cd-word of total degree \\(n-1\\), expand it left-to-right into blocks of length \\(1\\) (for \\(c\\)) and length \\(2\\) (for \\(d\\)), and define \\(R(M)\\subseteq[n-2]\\) as the set of starting indices of the length-2 blocks. This will make Lemma 3.1 genuinely watertight.\n\n- **Euler zigzag number convention**\n  - Nature: **potential ambiguity**\n  - Suggestion: Clarify whether \\(E_n\\) counts up-down only or both up-down and down-up. Your statement “maximal value equals \\(E_n\\)” is correct under the standard convention that both patterns have size \\(E_n\\), but you should say this explicitly.\n\n## Established building blocks\n\n- **EBB-ID-DESCENTSET-REFORMULATION**\n  - The translation \\(f(s)=\\beta_n(S)\\) with \\(S=\\{i:s_i=-1\\}\\) is correct and clean, and it correctly recasts the problem as “maximize the number of permutations with a fixed descent set.”\n\n- **EBB-ID-OMEGA-CHANGESET-CHARACTERIZATION**\n  - The observation that \\(\\omega(S):=\\{i: \\mathbf{1}_{i\\in S}\\neq \\mathbf{1}_{i+1\\in S}\\}\\) equals the set of adjacent sign changes, and that \\(\\omega(S)=[n-2]\\) iff \\(S\\) is parity-alternating (odd positions or even positions), is correct.\n\n- **EBB-ID-CDMONOMIAL-EXPANSION-LEMMA**\n  - Lemma 3.1 (a cd-monomial forces alternation constraints at the \\(d\\)-slots, and conversely any ab-word satisfying those constraints is achieved uniquely) is essentially correct once \\(R(M)\\) is precisely defined.\n\n- **EBB-ID-OMEGA-MONOTONICITY-FROM-NONNEG**\n  - Conditional building block: assuming \\(\\Psi_n=\\Phi_n(c,d)\\) with \\(\\gamma_M\\ge 0\\), the derived weak monotonicity \\(\\omega(S)\\subseteq \\omega(T)\\Rightarrow \\beta_n(S)\\le \\beta_n(T)\\) is correct.\n\n## Gap assessment\n\nYou wrote “Gaps: None.” I **disagree**.\n\n- The missing pieces are not algebraic manipulations; they are **foundational citations/justifications**:\n  1) the cd-index representation/positivity for \\(\\Psi_n\\), and  \n  2) a correct justification of **strict** \\(\\omega\\)-monotonicity (or at least strict comparison against the fully alternating case).\n\nThese are **Moderate** gaps if citations are allowed; they are **Fundamental** gaps if the solution must be self-contained and elementary.\n\n## Coverage assessment\n\nAll subparts addressed: **Yes (modulo the two justification gaps above)**\n\n- The attempt does identify, for each \\(n\\), which sign patterns maximize \\(f(s)\\).\n- It also correctly handles \\(n=2\\).\n- The only remaining concern is the validity/justification of the heavy imported theorem and strictness.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis attempt presents a coherent and plausibly correct solution strategy: translate to descent sets, encode by noncommutative ab-words, and use a cd-index expansion in \\(c=a+b\\), \\(d=ab+ba\\) with nonnegative coefficients to obtain a continuation-stable monotonicity principle in the “adjacent change set” \\(\\omega(S)\\). The combinatorial Lemma 3.1 connecting \\(d\\)-positions to forced alternations in ab-words is a good local mechanism, and the final deduction “maximize \\(\\omega(S)\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) fully alternating \\(S\\)” is correct.\n\nThe main weaknesses are not mathematical direction but **rigor and sourcing**: the cd-index existence/positivity input is asserted without a properly stated theorem or a reliable reference, and the strict inequality in Proposition 3.2 is not convincingly justified from the provided material. With those two patches (proper theorem statement + strictness justification), the solution becomes a correct complete proof (albeit significantly more advanced than necessary for many settings).\n\n## Recommendations for next iteration (prioritized)\n\n1. **Replace “standard fact” by a precise theorem statement + reputable citation.**  \n   Explicitly state: “\\(\\Psi_n\\) is the ab-index/flag enumerator of the face lattice of the permutohedron (an Eulerian poset), hence it has a cd-index with nonnegative coefficients (Bayer–Klapper …).” Provide a real source.\n\n2. **Fix the strictness step.**  \n   Either (a) cite a theorem that *explicitly* gives strict \\(\\omega\\)-monotonicity for \\(\\beta_n(S)\\), or (b) prove the special strictness you need: if \\(\\omega(S)\\neq[n-2]\\), then \\(\\beta_n(S)<\\beta_n(S_{\\text{alt}})\\).\n\n3. **Delete or correct the “exactly \\(E_n\\) monomials” sentence.**  \n   It is suspicious and unnecessary.\n\n4. **Formalize \\(R(M)\\) and the indexing convention once.**  \n   This will make Lemma 3.1 and the subsequent coefficient-extraction formula indisputable.\n\n## Meta-level guidance for both the problem solver and the orchestrator\n\n### Strategy-level assessment\n\nThe approach is **fundamentally sound but citation-dependent**. It cleanly resolves the previously missing “continuation-stable exchange” by replacing it with a global structural monotonicity from cd-index theory. This is a valid mathematical pivot, but it must be presented with correct theorem statements and sources.\n\n### Structural blockers\n\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-CDINDEX-FOUNDATION**  \n  Blocker if the solution must be self-contained; otherwise patchable by proper citation.\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-STRICT-OMEGA-MONOTONE**  \n  Blocker for the uniqueness/exact maximizer classification until strictness is correctly justified.\n\n### Dead directions / approaches to abandon\n\n- **DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-BLACKBOX-LIT-THEOREM** (reused)  \n  Still appropriate to avoid irrelevant black-box extremal theorems unrelated to the descent enumerator structure.\n\n### Promising lines and subproblems\n\n- Pin down the exact known result: “cd-index of the permutohedron / symmetric group” and extract the strict \\(\\omega\\)-monotonicity as a corollary with a clean reference.\n- Alternatively, if an elementary solution is desired, revert to the DP/dot-product framework from Attempts 2–3 and try to prove the internal exchange inequality directly (but that is a different project).\n\n### Recommendations for the orchestrator (prioritized)\n\n1. **Treat the descent-set reformulation and the \\(\\omega=[n-2]\\iff\\) alternating characterization as established** (EBB-ID-DESCENTSET-REFORMULATION, EBB-ID-OMEGA-CHANGESET-CHARACTERIZATION).\n2. **Request a corrected sourcing/theorem statement** for the cd-index positivity step (resolve MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-CDINDEX-FOUNDATION).\n3. **Force a strictness resolution**: either a citation of strict \\(\\omega\\)-monotonicity or a direct argument comparing any non-full \\(\\omega\\) to the full \\(\\omega\\) case (resolve MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-STRICT-OMEGA-MONOTONE).\n4. **Do not revisit the old DP unless the project explicitly forbids advanced theory.**\n\n## Research flag\n\nResearch needed: **No** (assuming citations are permitted).\n\nIf, however, the intended solution must be elementary/self-contained, then **Research needed: Yes** in the sense of “find/engineer an elementary proof” (likely via DP inequalities or injections), because cd-index theory is substantial external machinery.\n\n## Updated Registry of IDs\n\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-EXTTHM-BIPARTITE**: (Attempt 1) External extremal theorem about bipartite orientations/linear extensions; not used later.\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-GLOBAL-EXCHANGE**: Missing continuation-stable exchange in Attempts 1–3; **resolved in Attempt 4 by a cd-index-based monotonicity pivot (conditional on correctness of the cited theorem)**.\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-STRICTNESS-CONSTANT-X**: (Attempt 2) Strictness relied on “\\(x\\) not constant”; resolved in Attempt 3.\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-CDINDEX-FOUNDATION**: Attempt 4 relies on cd-index existence/positivity for \\(\\Psi_n\\) without a precise statement and reputable citation.\n- **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-STRICT-OMEGA-MONOTONE**: Attempt 4 strictness in Proposition 3.2 not justified from given material; needed to conclude *only* alternating patterns maximize.\n\n- **EBB-ID-LINEXT-BIJECTION-PS**: (Earlier) Reduction to linear extensions of an oriented-path poset (background).\n- **EBB-ID-DP-ENTRINGER-GENERAL**: (Earlier) Forward Entringer-type DP (prefix/suffix sums).\n- **EBB-ID-MONOTONE-VECTOR-INVARIANT**: (Earlier) Monotonicity of forward DP vector.\n- **EBB-ID-LASTSTEP-REARRANGEMENT**: (Earlier) Rearrangement end-step optimization.\n- **EBB-ID-BACKWARD-DP-DOTPRODUCT**: (Earlier) Backward/adjoint DP and dot-product factorization.\n- **EBB-ID-BACKWARD-MONOTONICITY**: (Earlier) Backward weights monotonicity.\n- **EBB-ID-NONCONST-FORWARD-V**: (Earlier) Non-constancy of forward DP vectors.\n- **EBB-ID-END-ALTERNATION-BOTH-SIDES**: (Earlier) Any maximizer alternates at both ends for \\(n\\ge 3\\).\n\n- **EBB-ID-DESCENTSET-REFORMULATION**: Attempt 4 descent-set equivalence \\(f(s)=\\beta_n(S)\\).\n- **EBB-ID-OMEGA-CHANGESET-CHARACTERIZATION**: Attempt 4 characterization of full \\(\\omega\\) as exactly the two alternating patterns.\n- **EBB-ID-CDMONOMIAL-EXPANSION-LEMMA**: Attempt 4 Lemma 3.1 (cd-monomial expansion constraints).\n- **EBB-ID-OMEGA-MONOTONICITY-FROM-NONNEG**: Attempt 4 conditional monotonicity from nonnegative cd-coefficients.\n\n- **DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-BLACKBOX-LIT-THEOREM**: Avoid irrelevant black-box extremal orientation theorem as a completion mechanism."

Problem and current state summary\n\n### Restatement of the problem\nGiven \\(n\\ge 2\\) and a sign pattern \\(s=(s_1,\\dots,s_{n-1})\\in\\{\\pm1\\}^{n-1}\\), let \\(f(s)\\) be the number of permutations \\(a=(a_1,\\dots,a_n)\\) of \\([n]\\) such that\n\\[\ns_i(a_{i+1}-a_i)>0\\quad\\text{for all }i=1,\\dots,n-1,\n\\]\ni.e. at each adjacent position we force either an ascent or a descent according to \\(s_i\\).  \nFor each \\(n\\), determine which sign patterns \\(s\\) maximize \\(f(s)\\).\n\nEquivalently (as the solver correctly reformulated), if \\(S=\\{i\\in[n-1]: s_i=-1\\}\\) is the descent set, then\n\\[\nf(s)=\\beta_n(S):=\\#\\{\\pi\\in S_n:\\mathrm{Des}(\\pi)=S\\},\n\\]\nand we want the subsets \\(S\\subseteq[n-1]\\) maximizing \\(\\beta_n(S)\\).\n\n### What has been achieved internally\n- **Attempts 2–3** built a correct Entringer-type DP, plus an adjoint/backward DP yielding a dot-product factorization \\(f(s)=\\langle v^{(k)},w^{(k)}\\rangle\\), and proved necessary “end alternation” constraints, but they lacked a continuation-stable global exchange argument.\n- **Attempt 4** introduced a **cd-index / ab-index approach** and an \\(\\omega\\)-map tracking adjacent sign changes:\n  \\[\n  \\omega(S)=\\{i\\in[n-2]: \\mathbf{1}_{i\\in S}\\neq \\mathbf{1}_{i+1\\in S}\\}.\n  \\]\n  It derived (conditionally) an \\(\\omega\\)-monotonicity principle and concluded that maximal \\(f(s)\\) occurs exactly for the two fully alternating sign patterns.\n\n### Main gaps highlighted by the expert evaluator on Attempt 4\n1. **CD-index foundation gap:** The solution asserted existence of a cd-index expansion with nonnegative coefficients for \\(\\Psi_n(a,b)=\\sum_{\\pi} u^{\\mathrm{Des}(\\pi)}\\), but cited an unreliable source (“studylib.net”) and did not properly state which theorem/structure implies it.\n2. **Strictness gap:** Even if weak monotonicity \\(\\omega(S)\\subseteq\\omega(T)\\Rightarrow \\beta_n(S)\\le \\beta_n(T)\\) holds, Attempt 4’s justification of **strict** monotonicity was not established.\n\nThe “minor issue” about “exactly \\(E_n\\) monomials” being dubious also needed correction.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key obstacles (rephrased as research questions)\n\n1. **Which standard reference proves that the descent-set enumerator \\(\\Psi_n(a,b)\\) can be written as \\(\\Phi_n(c,d)\\) with \\(c=a+b\\), \\(d=ab+ba\\), and (at least) nonnegative coefficients?**  \n   - More precisely: identify the correct object (Boolean algebra / simplex / symmetric group “ab-index”), and cite a reputable theorem.\n\n2. **Where is the strict \\(\\omega\\)-monotonicity statement proved (or how can it be proved cleanly)?**  \n   - Need a rigorous argument that \\(\\omega(S)\\subsetneq\\omega(T)\\Rightarrow \\beta_n(S)<\\beta_n(T)\\), or at minimum that any \\(\\omega(S)\\neq[n-2]\\) implies \\(\\beta_n(S)\\) is strictly smaller than the alternating case.\n\n3. **(Secondary) Correct the “number of monomials” claim:**  \n   - Determine the correct statement about how many cd-monomials/terms appear (distinct vs with multiplicity).\n\n---\n\n## 4. External research\n\n### Queries used\nI searched for:\n- “cd-index Flag f-vectors Stanley 1994”\n- “Bayer Klapper A New Index for Polytopes cd-index”\n- “omega(S) beta_n(S) Proposition 1.6.4 Stanley”\n- “Niven de Bruijn permutations with given ups and downs”\n- “cd-index boolean algebra André permutations”\n\n### Key sources found (and what they say)\n\n#### A) Stanley’s *Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol. 1* contains exactly the needed theorem + strictness\nA key discovery is that the Attempt 4 approach is essentially *already a standard result* in Stanley’s text: the book explicitly states the \\(\\omega\\)-monotonicity with **strictness** and gives the alternating maximizers as a corollary.\n\n- A publicly-circulating excerpt of the relevant pages (not itself an authoritative publisher source, but it reveals the exact theorem numbering and statements) contains:\n  - **Theorem 1.6.3**: \\(\\Psi_n\\) (the ab-index of \\(S_n\\) / Boolean algebra \\(B_n\\)) can be written as a cd-polynomial \\(\\Phi_n(c,d)\\) with \\(c=a+b\\), \\(d=ab+ba\\).\n  - **Proposition 1.6.4**: If \\(\\omega(S)\\subset \\omega(T)\\) then \\(\\beta_n(S)<\\beta_n(T)\\).\n  - **Corollary 1.6.5**: \\(\\beta_n(S)\\le E_n\\) (Euler zigzag number), with equality iff \\(S\\) is the odd positions or the even positions; i.e. the two alternating patterns. ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis single proposition/corollary pair is exactly the missing “global exchange” mechanism and simultaneously resolves the strictness issue.\n\n**How it matches Attempt 4 structurally.**  \nThe excerpt’s proof outline is the same as Attempt 4’s idea: express \\(\\beta_n(S)\\) as a sum of nonnegative cd-coefficients indexed by constraints \\(\\omega(S)\\supseteq R(\\text{cd-word})\\), and then prove strictness by exhibiting a cd-word \\(c^{i-1}dc^{n-2-i}\\) that separates \\(\\omega(S)\\) from \\(\\omega(T)\\). ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\n**How to cite it properly in a final writeup.**  \nIn a polished solution, one should cite the *book itself*:\n\n> R. P. Stanley, *Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol. 1*, 2nd ed., Cambridge Univ. Press, 2011. Section 1.6, especially Proposition 1.6.4 and Corollary 1.6.5.\n\nEven if you do not reproduce the full cd-index machinery, you can cite these results as a black box (common in olympiad/contest writeups if advanced references are allowed).\n\n#### B) Proper foundational sources for cd-index existence (Eulerian posets / polytopes)\nTo patch “MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-CDINDEX-FOUNDATION”, you can cite standard cd-index references:\n\n1) **Bayer–Klapper (1991), “A New Index for Polytopes”**  \nThis is a classic paper introducing/explicating the cd-index framework for polytopes and the generalized Dehn–Sommerville relations; it is a canonical reference for existence/definition of the cd-index in the polytope/Eulerian context. ([eudml.org](https://eudml.org/doc/131141))  \n(There is also an author-hosted abstract page.) ([bud.cs.uky.edu](https://bud.cs.uky.edu/~klapper/abs/newindex.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) **Stanley (1994), “Flag f-vectors and the cd-index”**  \nA central reference tying cd-index to flag enumeration and proving key positivity results in important cases (convex polytopes, etc.). This is a reputable place to cite “cd-index positivity” in polytope/poset settings. ([eudml.org](https://eudml.org/doc/174665))\n\n3) **Karu (2006), “The cd-index of fans and posets”**  \nProves nonnegativity of cd-index coefficients for broad topological classes (complete fans, regular CW-spheres, Gorenstein* posets), which certainly includes the Boolean algebra as the face lattice of a simplex. ([cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/compositio-mathematica/article/cdindex-of-fans-and-posets/FB166469FF48848CD1F41547039A2BEF?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese give a clean “theorem + reference” basis that is far more credible than “studylib.net”.\n\n#### C) Independent corroboration that the extremizers are alternating (older classical references)\nEven aside from the cd-index approach, the “alternating maximizes” phenomenon is classical, with older references:\n\n- **de Bruijn (1970), “Permutations with given ups and downs”**, Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde 18(1), 61–65. The Eindhoven research portal confirms the bibliographic details (PDF access was blocked to me due to 403, but the metadata is visible). ([research.tue.nl](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/permutations-with-given-ups-and-downs))  \nThis paper is widely cited as a source for extremal properties of up/down patterns.\n\n- A **MathOverflow question** explicitly notes that for the Boolean algebra \\(B_n\\) case, the “maximum achieved by alternating” goes back to Niven and de Bruijn and points to Stanley EC1 Prop. 1.6.4 as the generalization. ([mathoverflow.net](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/448180/largest-rank-selected-m%C3%B6bius-function-of-a-product-of-chains?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese are not needed if you cite Stanley’s Proposition 1.6.4 directly, but they are good backup/context.\n\n#### D) Correcting the “number of monomials” claim\nThe excerpt also clarifies the suspicious statement in Attempt 4:\n\n- It says \\(\\Phi_n\\) is “a sum of \\(E_n\\) monomials” but that the number of **distinct** cd-monomials of degree \\(n-1\\) is Fibonacci-like (specifically the Fibonacci number \\(F_n\\) in Stanley’s notation). ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\nSo the Attempt 4 sentence “\\(\\Phi_n\\) is a sum of exactly \\(E_n\\) monomials (‘cd-words’)” is **dangerous as written**:\n- If interpreted as “distinct cd-words,” it is wrong (distinct cd-words are Fibonacci many).\n- If interpreted as “a sum of \\(E_n\\) monomials allowing repetition,” it can be reconciled with Stanley’s statement (depending on conventions/normalization).\n\nThe safest fix is: *remove the claim entirely*, or replace it with the precise “distinct cd-words are Fibonacci many; coefficients are nonnegative integers.”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Impact on current solution method (Attempt 4)\n\n### Does the literature support the approach?\nYes—strongly. Attempt 4’s approach is essentially a re-derivation of a standard argument in Stanley’s *Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol. 1*, Section 1.6, culminating in Proposition 1.6.4 and Corollary 1.6.5. ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\n### Is the method flawed?\nNo. The method is sound; the issues were:\n- **sourcing** (non-authoritative citation),\n- **identification of the correct framework** (better phrased as the ab-index/cd-index of the Boolean algebra \\(B_n\\), i.e. face lattice of a simplex), and\n- **strictness** (which Stanley provides explicitly).\n\n### New “patch lemmas” suggested by the research\n1. Replace Section 2 (“standard fact…”) with a proper theorem statement such as:\n   - “The polynomial \\(\\Psi_n(a,b)=\\sum_{\\pi\\in S_n} u^{\\mathrm{Des}(\\pi)}\\) is the ab-index of the Boolean algebra \\(B_n\\) (or equivalently the \\(n-1\\)-simplex), hence it admits a cd-index \\(\\Phi_n(c,d)\\) with \\(c=a+b\\), \\(d=ab+ba\\).”  \n   Cite Stanley EC1 Theorem 1.6.3 (book) and/or Bayer–Klapper 1991, Stanley 1994. ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. Replace Proposition 3.2 strictness proof with:\n   - a direct citation to **Stanley EC1 Proposition 1.6.4**, or\n   - replicate Stanley’s argument: pick \\(i\\in\\omega(T)\\setminus\\omega(S)\\) and use the cd-word \\(c^{i-1}dc^{n-2-i}\\) (which occurs with positive coefficient in \\(\\Phi_n\\)) to force strict inequality. ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis directly resolves **MAJOR-ISSUE-ID-STRICT-OMEGA-MONOTONE**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Suggested new or refined approaches (1–3)\n\n### Approach A (recommended): “Cite Stanley EC1 Prop. 1.6.4 + Cor. 1.6.5”\n**Core idea.**  \nTreat the cd-index machinery as a black box and cite Stanley’s results that directly imply the maximizers are the two alternating patterns.\n\n**External results used.**\n- Stanley EC1 (2nd ed.) Theorem 1.6.3 (existence of cd-index for \\(\\Psi_n\\)), Proposition 1.6.4 (strict \\(\\omega\\)-monotonicity), Corollary 1.6.5 (maximizers are alternating). ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Main remaining hurdle.**\n- Writing a clean mapping from your sign sequence \\(s\\) to the descent set \\(S\\), then stating the theorem in those terms.\n\n### Approach B: “Foundation via Eulerian posets / simplex + Stanley 1994 or Karu 2006”\n**Core idea.**  \nIf you want to keep Attempt 4’s internal derivation (Lemma 3.1 etc.), then:\n- identify \\(\\Psi_n\\) as the ab-index of the Boolean algebra \\(B_n\\) (face lattice of a simplex),\n- cite a general cd-index existence theorem (Bayer–Klapper),\n- cite positivity/nonnegativity (Stanley 1994 for polytopes; Karu 2006 for Gorenstein*), and\n- then derive weak monotonicity from nonnegativity.\n\nFor strictness, cite Stanley’s Proposition 1.6.4 anyway (or import the specific “there exists a separating cd-word with positive coefficient” argument).\n\n**External results used.**\n- Bayer–Klapper 1991 for cd-index framework. ([eudml.org](https://eudml.org/doc/131141))  \n- Stanley 1994 or Karu 2006 for coefficient nonnegativity. ([eudml.org](https://eudml.org/doc/174665))  \n- Stanley EC1 Prop. 1.6.4 for strictness, or reproduce its separation argument. ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Main remaining hurdle.**\n- Ensuring the strictness step is airtight without overclaiming positivity of *every* cd-coefficient unless you cite exactly the needed theorem.\n\n### Approach C (backup / historical): “Classical extremal results (de Bruijn / Niven)”\n**Core idea.**  \nIf a “classical up-down permutations” reference is acceptable, you can cite de Bruijn (1970) or related classical literature proving the alternating pattern maximizes the number of permutations with a given up/down signature.\n\n**External results used.**\n- de Bruijn (1970) “Permutations with given ups and downs” (bibliographic metadata accessible). ([research.tue.nl](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/permutations-with-given-ups-and-downs))  \n- Context pointer: MathOverflow discussion referencing Niven + de Bruijn + Stanley’s generalization. ([mathoverflow.net](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/448180/largest-rank-selected-m%C3%B6bius-function-of-a-product-of-chains?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Main remaining hurdle.**\n- Depending on the venue, this may be considered too “black-box historical” compared with the cd-index route.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Difficulty assessment and next-step recommendation\n\n### Difficulty assessment\n**Likely solvable with careful work and existing theory** — and in fact it is essentially a known theorem in standard references (Stanley EC1 Section 1.6). ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\n### Concrete next internal step\nRevise Attempt 4 by **replacing the non-authoritative citation and filling strictness** as follows:\n\n1. **State explicitly** that \\(f(s)=\\beta_n(S)\\) where \\(S=\\{i:s_i=-1\\}\\).\n2. Define \\(\\omega(S)\\) as in Attempt 4 and note \\(\\omega(S)=[n-2]\\) iff \\(S\\) is odd/even positions (equivalently \\(s\\) is fully alternating).\n3. **Cite** Stanley EC1 Proposition 1.6.4: \\(\\omega(S)\\subset \\omega(T)\\Rightarrow \\beta_n(S)<\\beta_n(T)\\). ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))  \n4. Conclude the maximizers are exactly the two alternating patterns, and optionally cite Corollary 1.6.5 for the exact maximal value (Euler zigzag number) and uniqueness up to symmetry. ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n5. Delete or correct the “exactly \\(E_n\\) monomials” line: mention instead that the number of **distinct** cd-monomials is Fibonacci and avoid unnecessary claims. ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/7406105/2011-stanley---enumerative-combinatorics-volume-1--second...?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf the intended solution must be “elementary” and avoid cd-index, then you should revert to the Attempt 3 DP/dot-product framework and build the internal exchange lemma; but given the evaluator’s “solved with minor gaps” assessment, the cleanest patch is **proper citation to Stanley plus correcting the minor misstatement**."
