      "text": "You are an expert in advanced mathematics and mathematical research methodology.\n\nYou have access to a web search tool that can retrieve information from the mathematical literature and other high-quality sources.\n\nIn this phase, your job is to perform **targeted research** on a problem that has resisted several rounds of internal solution attempts.\n\nGeneral behavior:\n\n- You will be given:\n  - The original problem statement.\n  - (Optionally) A description of one or more approaches (a plan of attack, not a full solution) initially considered by the problem solver.\n  - One or more partial solution attempts, including the declared gaps and self-evaluation written by a problem solver.\n  - Feedback from an expert solution evaluator highlighting major issues and gaps in the solution attempts.\n  - (Possibly) Previous research notes and references from earlier research phases.\n- Your role is to:\n  - Diagnose which parts of the problem are **well understood internally** and which parts genuinely require **external knowledge or new ideas**.\n  - Formulate **concrete research questions and search queries**.\n  - Use the web search tool to look for:\n    - Results of relevance to the problem at hand.\n    - Results and techniques from related areas that might address the identified gaps in previous solution attempts.\n    - Results that may help clarify whether the problem is likely to be an open research problem or solvable with existing known methods.\n    - Results that could suggest new approaches to the problem or refinements to existing approaches.\n    - Known examples or counterexamples.\n    - Techniques used in similar settings.\n  - Extract and summarize relevant information for the specific problem.\n  - Propose ways in which the newly discovered information may help:\n    - Repair or refine existing approaches.\n    - Suggest new, well-grounded approaches.\n    - Correct mistakes and improve previously attempted solutions.\n  - Honestly assess whether the remaining gap still looks research-level or likely solvable with available tools.\n\nImportant Guidelines and Constraints:\n\n- If a web search tool is available, you are free to use it if needed; if not, explicitly state it was unavailable and proceed with best-effort from memory/internal reasoning.\n- Use the web search tool (if available) if it is likely to improve your understanding of the obstacle; once you have formulated clear research questions, you are strongly encouraged to run at least a few targeted searches.\n- If you are given previous research notes on the same problem, treat them as context: avoid repeating the same references and focus on new angles, refinements, or corrections.\n- Do not fabricate references or URLs. Only cite papers, books, or web resources that you actually found via the web search tool, or that are clearly standard and widely known. If you are unsure whether a reference exists, say so instead of inventing details.\n- Pay particular attention to any explicit \"Research needed\" comments from the expert solution evaluator; treat them as high-priority topics for your external search.\n- DO NOT attempt to write a full solution here. Your job is to **support** the problem solver and the expert solution evaluator, not replace them.\n- Be explicit about what you found and where it comes from (paper titles, authors, standard names of theorems when available).\n- If the literature does not seem to contain results of relevance to the problem, say so clearly. Do not overstate.\n- If you are unsure whether a result applies to the problem at hand, explain the obstacles (missing hypotheses, different parameter regimes, etc.).\n- Write in a clear, structured, markdown-friendly and LaTeX-friendly style suitable for a mathematically literate human reader.\n\n## REQUIRED OUTPUT\n\nReturn the following information, in order, using clear headings:\n\n1. A level 1 heading entitled \"External Research Input\". At the beginning of your response, print exactly the following lines (do not wrap these lines in a code block; they should appear as normal markdown in the output):\n\n   # External Research Input\n\n2. Problem and current state summary:\n\n   - Briefly restate the problem in your own words.\n   - Summarize:\n     - Key reductions, simplifications and reformulations of the problem or the method.\n     - Main approaches tried so far.\n     - Main gaps identified by the problem solver and expert solution evaluator.\n     - What the internal system has already achieved, based on all solution attempts and evaluations you were given. If there are multiple attempts, focus especially on the most recent attempt and any earlier attempt that used a significantly different approach.\n\n3. Key obstacles:\n\n   - Pay special attention to gaps marked as \"Fundamental\" or similar by the expert solution evaluator, and turn those into your primary research questions.\n   - List the main technical or conceptual obstacles that seem to require external input.\n   - For each obstacle, phrase it as a research question if possible.\n\n4. External research:\n\n   - State which search queries you considered and (if relevant) which ones you actually used.\n   - For each important piece of information you find:\n     - Give the source and also the URL where appropriate.\n     - Summarize the result in your own words, including key hypotheses and conclusions.\n     - Explain how it **might** apply to the current problem, and what additional work would be needed to make it applicable.\n   - If you find conflicting sources or unclear statements, point that out explicitly.\n\n5. Impact on current solution method:\n   Discuss:\n\n   - Whether any external result supports the currently attempted method of solving the problem or suggests modifications.\n   - Whether the current solution method appears fundamentally flawed in light of the literature.\n   - Any new lemmas, invariants, normalizations, or potential functions suggested by the research.\n\n6. Suggested new or refined approaches:\n\n   - Based on the research, propose 1–3 refined or new high-level approaches the problem solver and expert solution evaluator should consider.\n   - For each:\n     - Give a brief name and core idea.\n     - Explain which external results it intends to use or mimic.\n     - Mention the main technical hurdles that remain.\n\n7. Difficulty assessment and next-step recommendation:\n   - Give an honest assessment of whether, in your view, the problem now seems:\n     - “Likely solvable with careful work and existing theory”, or\n     - “Borderline research-level but possibly approachable”, or\n     - “Very likely beyond current methods / open”.\n   - Recommend concretely what the **next internal step** should be:\n     - e.g., “Have the problem solver go back to redesigning possible approaches to the problem with these new references as tools”,\n     - or “Have the problem solver refine Approach 1 using the specific theorem in [X]”,\n     - or “Recognize this as likely open and treat the exponent result as the main achievable goal.”\n   - Be as precise and concrete as you can while remaining honest about uncertainty and the limits of the available literature."

This is equivalent to the statement that \\(f(k)<\\infty\\) for every \\(k\\ge 3\\). (This equivalence is explicitly noted in Walker’s discussion of \\(f(k)\\).) ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2203.06045))\n\nSo part (i) necessarily splits into: what we can prove unconditionally (lower bounds), what is known conditionally if \\(f(k)\\) is finite, and what is known for small \\(k\\).\n\n---\n\n### 1. A “trivial” but important lower bound in terms of \\(W(k)\\)\n\nLet \\(W(k)=W(2,k)\\) denote the **two-color van der Waerden number**: the least integer \\(N\\) such that every 2-coloring of \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}\\) contains a monochromatic \\(k\\)-term arithmetic progression.\n\nThere exists a 2-coloring of \\(\\{1,\\dots,W(k)-1\\}\\) with **no** monochromatic \\(k\\)-AP. Let the two color classes be \\(R\\) and \\(B\\). Then both \\(R\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(k\\)-AP-free.\n\nNow\n\\[\n\\sum_{n\\in R}\\frac1n\\;+\\;\\sum_{n\\in B}\\frac1n \\;=\\; \\sum_{n=1}^{W(k)-1}\\frac1n \\;=\\; H_{W(k)-1},\n\\]\nso one of the two sums is at least \\(H_{W(k)-1}/2\\).

([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/169?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Remark.** Improving the constant \\(\\tfrac12\\) in a uniform way (e.g. showing \\(\\frac{f(k)}{\\log W(k)}\\ge \\frac12+\\delta\\) for any fixed \\(\\delta>0\\)) is currently open, as noted in the same source. ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/169?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n### 2. Best known general lower bounds for \\(f(k)\\)\n\n#### 2.1 Berlekamp’s linear bound\nBerlekamp proved a construction giving\n\\[\nf(k)\\ \\ge\\ \\frac{\\log 2}{2}\\,k.\n\\]\nThis is recorded in the standard references on this problem. ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/169?utm_source=openai))\n\n#### 2.2 Gerver’s \\((1-o(1))k\\log k\\) bound (as \\(k\\to\\infty\\))\nGerver proved a substantially stronger asymptotic lower bound:\nfor every \\(\\varepsilon>0\\), for all sufficiently large \\(k\\) there exists a \\(k\\)-AP-free set \\(S_k\\) with\n\\[\n\\sum_{n\\in S_k}\\frac1n\\ >\\ (1-\\varepsilon)\\,k\\log k.\n\\]\nEquivalently,\n\\[\nf(k)\\ \\ge\\ (1-o(1))\\,k\\log k\\qquad (k\\to\\infty).\n\\]\nThis is stated as the main theorem in Gerver’s paper and is quoted in the problem background. ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/9125569/the-sum-of-the-reciprocals-of-a-set-of-integers-with?utm_source=openai))\n\nSo, **unconditionally**, the best general lower bound currently on record is\n\\[\nf(k)\\ \\ge\\ (1-o(1))k\\log k.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. What is known about finiteness / upper bounds?\n\nThis is where the main difficulty lies: for \\(k\\ge 4\\) it is unknown whether \\(f(k)\\) is finite at all.\n\n#### 3.1 The case \\(k=3\\): \\(f(3)<\\infty\\) is known\nBloom and Sisask proved that if \\(A\\subset\\{1,\\dots,N\\}\\) is 3-AP-free then \\(|A|\\ll N/(\\log N)^{1+c}\\) for some absolute \\(c>0\\). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03528?utm_source=openai))  \nThis “breaks the logarithmic barrier” in Roth-type bounds and implies:\n\n> Any 3-AP-free set \\(A\\subset\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\) has \\(\\sum_{n\\in A} \\frac1n<\\infty\\).\n\nSketch of the deduction (standard partial summation argument): let \\(A(x)=|A\\cap[1,x]|\\). Then\n\\[\n\\sum_{\\substack{n\\in A\\\\ n\\le N}}\\frac1n\n= \\frac{A(N)}{N}+\\int_1^N \\frac{A(x)}{x^2}\\,dx.\n\\]\nIf \\(A(x)\\ll x/(\\log x)^{1+c}\\), then \\(\\int_2^\\infty \\frac{dx}{x(\\log x)^{1+c}}<\\infty\\), giving convergence. Hence \\(f(3)<\\infty\\). Walker explicitly notes that Bloom–Sisask’s work establishes finiteness of \\(f(3)\\), while \\(f(k)\\) for \\(k>3\\) remains unknown. ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2203.06045))\n\n#### 3.2 The cases \\(k\\ge 4\\): finiteness of \\(f(k)\\) is open\nFor longer progressions, quantitative forms of Szemerédi’s theorem give bounds of the form\n\\[\nr_k(N):=\\max\\{|A|:A\\subset[1,N]\\text{ is \\(k\\)-AP-free}\\}\\le \\frac{N}{(\\log\\log N)^{c_k}}\n\\]\nfor some very small \\(c_k>0\\) (depending on \\(k\\)), but such bounds are far too weak to imply convergence of \\(\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac1n\\). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szemer%C3%A9di%27s_theorem?utm_source=openai))\n\nThus, for \\(k\\ge 4\\), it is currently consistent with known results that:\n\n- \\(f(k)\\) is finite but extremely large, or\n- \\(f(k)=\\infty\\) (which would refute the Erdős–Turán conjecture).\n\nNo unconditional nontrivial upper bound of the form \\(f(k)\\le C(k)\\) is known for \\(k\\ge 4\\), because producing such a bound is essentially as hard as proving the conjecture for that \\(k\\). ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/169?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n### 4. Numerical / small-\\(k\\) records\n\nThe problem statement also mentions best known explicit lower bounds for small \\(k\\), which are part of the “estimate” landscape:\n\n- \\(f(3)\\ge 3.00849\\) due to Wróblewski (1984). ([math.stackexchange.com](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/114504/arithmetic-progressions?utm_source=openai))\n- \\(f(4)\\ge 4.43975\\) due to Alexander Walker (paper last revised September 2025 on arXiv). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06045))\n\nWalker’s work also shows a reduction: for every \\(k\\) and \\(\\varepsilon>0\\), there is a **Kempner (digit-restricted) set** \\(A\\) that is \\(k\\)-AP-free with harmonic sum within \\(\\varepsilon\\) of \\(f(k)\\). ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2203.06045))  \nSo, in principle, estimating \\(f(k)\\) can be reduced to optimizing over a structured family of digit-restriction constructions, though this does not yet yield asymptotics.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Answer to (i): “Estimate \\(f(k)\\)”\n\nGiven the above, the most honest “estimate” one can currently provide is a range of **provable lower bounds** plus the status of upper bounds/finite vs infinite.\n\n#### 5.1 Unconditional lower bounds\nFor large \\(k\\),\n\\[\nf(k)\\ \\ge\\ (1-o(1))\\,k\\log k \\qquad \\text{(Gerver).}\n\\]\nAlso for every \\(k\\),\n\\[\nf(k)\\ \\ge\\ \\frac12H_{W(k)-1}\\ =\\ \\frac12\\log W(k)+O(1).\n\\]\nAnd a weaker but explicit-in-\\(k\\) bound is\n\\[\nf(k)\\ \\ge\\ \\frac{\\log 2}{2}\\,k.\n\\]\nAll of these are standard recorded bounds. ([paperzz.com](https://paperzz.com/doc/9125569/the-sum-of-the-reciprocals-of-a-set-of-integers-with?utm_source=openai))\n\n#### 5.2 Upper bounds / finiteness\n- \\(f(3)<\\infty\\) is known (Bloom–Sisask), hence the Erdős conjecture holds for 3-term progressions. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03528?utm_source=openai))\n- For \\(k\\ge 4\\), it is open whether \\(f(k)<\\infty\\). ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2203.06045))\n\nSo, for \\(k\\ge 4\\), the best available “estimate” is:  \n\\[\n(1-o(1))k\\log k \\ \\le\\ f(k)\\ \\le\\ \\infty,\n\\]\nwith the finiteness question being a major open problem.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Answer to (ii): does \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(k)}{\\log W(k)}=\\infty\\)?\n\n#### 6.1 What we can prove\nWe can prove only the universal lower bound\n\\[\n\\frac{f(k)}{\\log W(k)}\\ \\ge\\ \\frac12+o(1),\n\\]\ncoming from the harmonic-sum averaging argument in §1. ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/169?utm_source=openai))\n\n#### 6.2 Why this is open (and stronger than the known “\\(\\tfrac12\\)” barrier)\nThe background states that even improving \\(\\tfrac12\\) to any fixed constant \\(>\\tfrac12\\) is open. ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/169?utm_source=openai))  \nIf one cannot even prove \\(\\frac{f(k)}{\\log W(k)}\\ge 0.5001\\) for all large \\(k\\), then proving that the ratio tends to \\(+\\infty\\) is presently out of reach with current methods.\n\n#### 6.3 Heuristic expectation (conditional discussion)\nThere is experimental/heuristic evidence in the van der Waerden literature that \\(W(r,k)\\) might behave like roughly \\(r^k\\) in some regimes (in particular, for fixed \\(r\\) and growing \\(k\\)). ([combinatorialpress.com](https://combinatorialpress.com/jcmcc-articles/volume-128/new-lower-bounds-for-van-der-waerden-numbers-using-distributed-computing/?utm_source=openai))  \nIf (purely heuristically) one had \\(\\log W(k)\\asymp k\\), then combining Gerver’s lower bound \\(f(k)\\gtrsim k\\log k\\) would suggest\n\\[\n\\frac{f(k)}{\\log W(k)}\\ \\gtrsim\\ \\log k \\ \\to\\ \\infty.\n\\]\nBut such an upper bound \\(\\log W(k)=O(k)\\) is far beyond what is known rigorously, so this does **not** resolve (ii).\n\n#### 6.4 Logical alternative if \\(f(k)=\\infty\\) for some \\(k\\)\nIf the Erdős–Turán conjecture fails for some \\(k_0\\), then \\(f(k_0)=\\infty\\), and because \\(f(k)\\) is nondecreasing in \\(k\\), one would have \\(f(k)=\\infty\\) for all \\(k\\ge k_0\\). In that scenario, the ratio \\(\\frac{f(k)}{\\log W(k)}\\) is trivially \\(+\\infty\\) for large \\(k\\), so the answer to (ii) would be “yes”, but at the cost of a major conjecture being false. This logical point is noted in discussions of the problem. ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/169?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Conclusion for (ii):** Open.\n\n---\n\n## Gaps\n\n### Gap 1: True asymptotic order of \\(f(k)\\) (even finiteness) for \\(k\\ge 4\\)\n- **Location:** Part (i), “upper bounds / finiteness”.\n- **Description:** For \\(k\\ge 4\\), it is unknown whether \\(f(k)\\) is finite, so no genuine two-sided estimate is currently possible.\n- **Reason for difficulty:** Proving \\(f(k)<\\infty\\) is essentially the Erdős–Turán conjecture for \\(k\\)-term progressions, which is open beyond \\(k=3\\). Existing quantitative Szemerédi bounds are too weak to imply convergence of \\(\\sum_{n\\in A}1/n\\). ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/169?utm_source=openai))\n\n### Gap 2: The limit in (ii)\n- **Location:** Part (ii).\n- **Description:** Whether \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} f(k)/\\log W(k)=\\infty\\) is not settled by current techniques; even proving \\(\\liminf > 1/2\\) is open.\n- **Reason for difficulty:** One needs substantially stronger lower bounds on \\(f(k)\\) *in terms of* \\(W(k)\\), or significantly better understanding/bounds on \\(W(k)\\) itself, neither of which are currently available. ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/169?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Self-evaluation\n\nConfidence score (0–100): 90\n\nKnown or suspected issues:  \n- No substantive mathematical gaps in the **proved** statements (the averaging argument for the \\(\\tfrac12\\) bound, monotonicity, and the implication “Bloom–Sisask bound \\(\\Rightarrow f(3)<\\infty\\)” are standard).  \n- The main limitations are intrinsic: key parts of (i) and all of (ii) are open problems.  \n- I did not reproduce Gerver’s construction in full detail; I treated it as a cited theorem.\n\nCoverage:  \n- Part (i): Provided the best-known general lower bounds and explained the (mostly unknown) upper-bound/finite-vs-infinite situation, including the resolved case \\(k=3\\).  \n- Part (ii): Gave the trivial lower bound \\(\\ge 1/2\\) with proof, explained why the limit question is open, and discussed conditional/heuristic implications."

This is not a logical flaw, but it weakens exam-level reliability.  \n  *Suggestion:* where possible, cite the original papers (Berlekamp 1968, Gerver 1977, Bloom–Sisask 2020, Walker arXiv) and treat discussion sites as “commentary only”.\n\n- **Notation: \\(W(k)\\).**  \n  You set \\(W(k)=W(2,k)\\), which is almost certainly what the problem intends (given the “\\(\\tfrac12\\)” argument).  \n  *Suggestion:* say explicitly “I interpret \\(W(k)\\) as the 2-colour van der Waerden number \\(W(2,k)\\)”.\n\n## Established building blocks\n- **EBB-ID-MONO-FK:** *Monotonicity of \\(f(k)\\) in \\(k\\).*  \n  Your observation that “\\(k\\)-AP-free \\(\\Rightarrow \\ell\\)-AP-free for \\(\\ell\\ge k\\)” and hence \\(f(k)\\le f(\\ell)\\) is correct and reusable.\n\n- **EBB-ID-VW-HALF:** *Van der Waerden averaging lower bound.*  \n  The argument using a 2-colouring of \\([1,W(k)-1]\\) with no monochromatic \\(k\\)-AP to obtain  \n  \\[\n  f(k)\\ge \\frac12\\,H_{W(k)-1}\n  \\]\n  is correct and is precisely the standard “trivial \\(\\tfrac12\\)” lower bound.\n\n- **EBB-ID-PSUM-CRIT:** *Partial summation criterion for convergence of \\(\\sum_{n\\in A}1/n\\).*  \n  The formula\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{\\substack{n\\in A\\\\ n\\le N}}\\frac1n\n  = \\frac{A(N)}{N}+\\int_1^N \\frac{A(x)}{x^2}\\,dx\n  \\]\n  and the deduction that \\(A(x)\\ll x/(\\log x)^{1+c}\\) implies convergence are standard and correct. This is a sound block to reuse for the implication “Roth-type bounds \\(\\Rightarrow f(3)<\\infty\\)”.\n\n## Gap assessment\nYou listed two gaps; both are indeed genuine and not “missing steps” in your write-up.\n\n- **Gap 1: asymptotics / finiteness for \\(k\\ge 4\\).**  \n  **Assessment:** Fundamental.  \n  This is essentially the Erdős–Turán conjecture for \\(k\\)-term APs (for fixed \\(k\\)), which is open beyond \\(k=3\\).\n\n- **Gap 2: the limit \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} f(k)/\\log W(k)\\).**  \n  **Assessment:** Fundamental.  \n  As you correctly note, even showing a uniform improvement over \\(1/2\\) is open in current literature; therefore the divergence of the ratio is far beyond what is presently proved.\n\n## Coverage assessment\nAll subparts addressed: Yes.\n\n- **Part (i):** You accurately reported the best-known general lower bounds and the finiteness status (known only for \\(k=3\\), open for \\(k\\ge 4\\)).  \n- **Part (ii):** You correctly identified it as open and explained why the “\\(\\tfrac12\\)” barrier is the current unconditional baseline.\n\n## Summary\nYour write-up functions as a reasonable survey-style answer: it gives the correct definition of \\(f(k)\\), proves the standard van der Waerden lower bound \\(f(k)\\ge \\tfrac12 H_{W(k)-1}\\), records the major known lower bounds (Berlekamp linear and Gerver \\((1-o(1))k\\log k\\)), and correctly explains that finiteness is known only for \\(k=3\\) (via Roth-type density bounds strong enough to make \\(\\sum 1/n\\) converge). You also correctly state that for \\(k\\ge 4\\) finiteness is open, and that the limit question in (ii) is open (indeed stronger than currently accessible). The mathematics you actually *prove* in the attempt (monotonicity, the van der Waerden averaging argument, and the partial summation implication) is correct.\n\nThe main weaknesses are presentational/rigour-attribution issues: you sometimes give an imprecise form of quantitative Szemerédi bounds and rely on weak secondary sources; and some key deductions are sketched rather than written in a fully self-contained way. None of these are fatal, but tightening them would make the exposition exam-grade. The “heuristic” comments about \\(W(k)\\) are fine as heuristics but should remain clearly separated from the rigorous core (which you mostly did).\n\nOverall, as an “estimate + status” response to an open-ended/open-problem-flavoured question, the approach is sound and close to what one can responsibly say without proving new results.\n\n## Recommendations for next iteration (prioritized)\n1. **State the exact “trivial” inequality cleanly:** record \\(f(k)\\ge \\tfrac12 H_{W(k)-1}\\ge \\tfrac12\\log W(k)\\) (no \\(O(1)\\) needed for the core inequality).\n2. **Make the Bloom–Sisask \\(\\Rightarrow f(3)<\\infty\\) deduction fully explicit:** write the partial summation step with \\(A(x)\\) and show the integral converges (one tight paragraph).\n3. **Remove or sharpen the quantitative Szemerédi claim:** either drop the explicit \\(N/(\\log\\log N)^{c_k}\\) form or replace it with a correct, sourced statement from primary literature.\n4. **Use primary sources for the key facts:** cite Berlekamp (1968), Gerver (1977), Bloom–Sisask (2020), Walker (arXiv). Treat discussion forums as secondary commentary only.\n5. **Clarify the definition of \\(W(k)\\):** explicitly fix \\(W(k)=W(2,k)\\) (2-colour), matching the averaging argument.\n\n## Meta-level guidance for both the problem solver and the orchestrator\n### Strategy-level assessment\nThe “strategy” here is essentially to produce a **state-of-the-art summary** plus prove the standard easy inequality. That is appropriate because both (i) (in the sense of two-sided asymptotics/upper bounds for \\(k\\ge4\\)) and (ii) are fundamentally open. There is no hidden local lemma that will suddenly close these.\n\n### Structural blockers\nNone of your own steps block progress; the blockers are the underlying open problems (Erdős–Turán for \\(k\\ge4\\), and strengthening the \\(\\tfrac12\\) van-der-Waerden averaging lower bound).\n\n### Dead directions / approaches to abandon\n- **DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-HEURVW:** Attempting to “prove” (ii) by assuming/leaning on heuristic growth laws like \\(\\log W(k)\\asymp k\\) or \\(W(k)\\approx 2^k\\).  \n  *Justification:* This is not currently within reach; using it can at best give conditional heuristics, not a proof.\n\n### Promising lines and subproblems\n- If the goal is to **write the best possible final response**, the promising subproblem is expository: present the known lower bounds, the equivalence to Erdős–Turán, and the status for \\(k=3\\) vs \\(k\\ge4\\) cleanly and with primary citations.\n- If the goal is **research progress**, then natural subproblems are:\n  1. Any method to show \\(f(4)<\\infty\\) (even astronomically large), i.e., “divergent harmonic sum \\(\\Rightarrow\\) 4-AP exists”.\n  2. Any systematic improvement to the van der Waerden averaging constant \\(1/2\\) (uniformly in \\(k\\)), which the background notes is open.\n\n### Recommendations for the orchestrator (prioritized)\n1. **Treat EBB-ID-VW-HALF and EBB-ID-PSUM-CRIT as established and reuse them** in the final consolidated answer.\n2. **Stop trying to fully “solve” (i) and (ii) in the sense of new theorems**; frame them explicitly as open beyond the cited bounds.\n3. **If the final answer must include “current records” (e.g., best known \\(f(3)\\), \\(f(4)\\)), spawn a verification/research phase** to confirm up-to-date values and correct bibliographic references (since these can change).\n4. **In the next solution draft, focus on tightening rigor and citations, not on adding new speculative heuristics.**\n\n## Research flag\nResearch needed: Yes.  \nResolving finiteness of \\(f(k)\\) for any \\(k\\ge4\\) and proving any uniform improvement over \\(\\tfrac12\\) in \\(f(k)/\\log W(k)\\) are both open problems; addressing them would require genuine research-level advances beyond standard textbook arguments.\n\n## Updated Registry of IDs\n- **EBB-ID-MONO-FK:** Monotonicity \\(f(k)\\le f(\\ell)\\) for \\(\\ell\\ge k\\).\n- **EBB-ID-VW-HALF:** Van der Waerden averaging bound \\(f(k)\\ge \\tfrac12 H_{W(k)-1}\\ge \\tfrac12\\log W(k)\\).\n- **EBB-ID-PSUM-CRIT:** Partial summation criterion converting counting bounds \\(A(x)\\) into convergence of \\(\\sum_{n\\in A}1/n\\).\n- **DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-HEURVW:** Proving (ii) via unproved heuristics about the growth of \\(W(k)\\)."

This is fine for a survey-style answer, but for exam-grade reliability you should cite the original sources (Berlekamp 1968; Gerver 1977) directly when stating their main quantitative bounds.  \n  *Suggestion:* swap the citations (or add them) to the primary papers; keep Walker as a secondary overview.\n\n- **§4.2 (“Bloom–Sisask implies \\(f(3)<\\infty\\)”) — one tiny uniformity sentence missing.**  \n  Your logic is correct, but to make it fully watertight you should explicitly note: Bloom–Sisask gives a bound \\(r_3(N)\\le C N/(\\log N)^{1+c}\\) for **all sufficiently large \\(N\\)** (or for all \\(N\\) with a modified constant), and therefore for *any* infinite 3-AP-free \\(A\\), the counting function satisfies \\(A(x)\\le C' x/(\\log x)^{1+c}\\) for all large \\(x\\).  \n  *Suggestion:* add one sentence linking “finite-interval extremal bound” \\(\\Rightarrow\\) “counting-function bound” for an arbitrary infinite set.\n\n- **§5 (small-\\(k\\) records) — potentially time-sensitive; should be labelled “as of date X”.**  \n  Since the current date is **January 28, 2026**, the “records” for \\(f(3)\\) and \\(f(4)\\) might have changed after Sep 2025. Your statement could become outdated.  \n  *Suggestion:* phrase as “as of Walker’s Sep 4, 2025 revision, …” and/or add “to the best of my knowledge as of [date]”.\n\n- **§5 (Kempner-set reduction) — the conditionality is slightly unclear.**  \n  You wrote “assuming the relevant harmonic series converges… approximated by a Kempner set.” The background statement you were given says the reduction works to approximate \\(f(k)\\) (in the sense of achieving \\(f(k)-\\varepsilon\\)), which is only meaningful when \\(f(k)<\\infty\\). Your phrasing is probably aiming at that, but it reads slightly ambiguous.  \n  *Suggestion:* clarify: “If \\(f(k)<\\infty\\), then for every \\(\\varepsilon>0\\) there is a \\(k\\)-AP-free Kempner set with sum \\(\\ge f(k)-\\varepsilon\\).”\n\n- **Notation / normalization.**  \n  You use \\(\\log\\) as the natural logarithm, which is standard in analytic number theory and additive combinatorics, but it can be worth saying once.\n\n## Established building blocks\n- **EBB-ID-MONO-FK:** *Monotonicity of \\(f(k)\\) in \\(k\\).*  \n  Correct and cleanly argued: if \\(k\\le \\ell\\), then \\(k\\)-AP-free \\(\\Rightarrow \\ell\\)-AP-free, hence \\(f(k)\\le f(\\ell)\\).\n\n- **EBB-ID-VW-HALF:** *Exact van der Waerden averaging lower bound.*  \n  Your Proposition 2.2 is fully correct and now in the strongest clean form:  \n  \\[\n  f(k)\\ge \\frac12 H_{W(k)-1}\\ge \\frac12\\log W(k),\n  \\]\n  and hence \\(f(k)/\\log W(k)\\ge 1/2\\).\n\n- **EBB-ID-PSUM-CRIT:** *Partial summation identity and convergence criterion.*  \n  Lemma 4.1 and Corollary 4.2 are correct, well-presented, and reusable. This is the standard bridge from density/size bounds to convergence of \\(\\sum_{n\\in A}1/n\\).\n\n## Gap assessment\nYou listed two gaps; I agree they are genuine and not “missing steps”.\n\n- **Gap 1: two-sided asymptotics / finiteness for \\(k\\ge 4\\).**  \n  **Assessment:** Fundamental.  \n  This is essentially the Erdős–Turán conjecture beyond the known \\(k=3\\) case.\n\n- **Gap 2: limit \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} f(k)/\\log W(k)\\).**  \n  **Assessment:** Fundamental.  \n  As you correctly say, even a uniform improvement over \\(1/2\\) is open (per the background), so proving divergence to \\(+\\infty\\) is far beyond current unconditional techniques.\n\n## Coverage assessment\nAll subparts addressed: Yes.\n\n- **Part (i):** You give the right landscape: the standard van der Waerden lower bound in terms of \\(W(k)\\), the best known general asymptotic lower bound \\((1-o(1))k\\log k\\), and you correctly explain that upper bounds/finiteness are known only for \\(k=3\\) and open for \\(k\\ge 4\\).\n- **Part (ii):** You correctly identify the question as open, and you record the best unconditional baseline \\(\\ge 1/2\\) and the “even \\(>1/2\\) is open” barrier.\n\n## Summary\nYour Solution Attempt 2 is a meaningful and mathematically correct “best-possible with current knowledge” response to an open-problem-flavoured question. The core arguments you actually prove (monotonicity; the van der Waerden averaging bound; the partial summation criterion; the deduction \\(f(3)<\\infty\\) from a Roth-type bound) are correct and sufficiently rigorous. You also appropriately refrain from claiming progress on the genuinely open parts (finiteness for \\(k\\ge4\\), and the divergence question in (ii)). The key improvements relative to Attempt 1—clean exact inequality \\(f(k)\\ge \\tfrac12 H_{W(k)-1}\\ge \\tfrac12\\log W(k)\\) and removal of the dubious quantitative Szemerédi bound—materially improve exam-level quality.\n\nThe remaining weaknesses are mostly expositional and bibliographic: a couple of statements are time-sensitive (records), and your citations for the historical lower bounds could be made more primary. None of these affect correctness of the mathematical reasoning you present.\n\nOverall, this is close to an “ideal” survey answer given that the main questions are open.\n\n## Recommendations for next iteration (prioritized)\n1. **Add one explicit line justifying the passage “finite-interval extremal bound \\(\\Rightarrow\\) counting-function bound”** in §4.2 (it’s standard but worth stating cleanly).\n2. **Replace/add citations for Berlekamp and Gerver with the original papers** (and keep Walker/Erdős Problems as secondary corroboration).\n3. **Timestamp the “record” statements** (e.g., “as of Sep 4, 2025 revision of Walker…”), since the current date is Jan 28, 2026.\n4. **Clarify the conditional meaning of the Kempner reduction** (it approximates \\(f(k)\\) in the finite case; if \\(f(k)=\\infty\\) the statement must be rephrased appropriately).\n\n## Meta-level guidance for both the probem solver and the orchestrator\n\n### Strategy-level assessment\nThe approach—prove the standard easy inequality and otherwise report the sharpest known bounds and open status—is the correct approach here. There is no realistic “elementary completion” available because the central issues are open research problems.\n\n### Structural blockers\nNone arising from your write-up. The only blockers are the underlying open problems (Erdős–Turán for \\(k\\ge4\\); improvement over the \\(\\tfrac12\\) van der Waerden baseline).\n\n### Dead directions / approaches to abandon\n- **DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-HEURVW:** Proving (ii) by assuming heuristic growth of \\(W(k)\\) (e.g. \\(\\log W(k)\\asymp k\\)).  \n  *Justification:* Such heuristics are not currently provable at the required strength, so they cannot yield a rigorous answer.\n\n### Promising lines and subproblems\n- **Expository consolidation:** produce a clean final narrative: exact \\(\\tfrac12\\)-bound, best-known \\(k\\log k\\) lower bound, \\(k=3\\) finiteness proof via partial summation, and open status for \\(k\\ge4\\).  \n- **Research-facing subproblems (if one were to push beyond survey):**\n  1. Any method that forces a counting bound \\(A(x)\\ll x/(\\log x)^{1+\\delta}\\) for \\(k=4\\)-AP-free sets.\n  2. Any structural improvement to the van der Waerden averaging argument that yields \\(>1/2\\) uniformly.\n\n### Recommendations for the orchestrator\n1. **Treat EBB-ID-VW-HALF and EBB-ID-PSUM-CRIT as established and reuse them** verbatim in the consolidated final response.\n2. **Do not push for a “full solution” to (ii)**; present it as open, with the precise sense in which it is stronger than known results.\n3. **If the final response must mention “current records” for \\(f(3)\\), \\(f(4)\\)**, schedule a verification step (these are time-sensitive as of Jan 2026).\n4. **Keep the output framed as: known lower bounds + known finiteness for \\(k=3\\) + open for \\(k\\ge4\\).** Avoid speculative quantitative claims about \\(W(k)\\) or about Szemerédi bounds unless sourced precisely.\n\n## Research flag\nResearch needed: Yes.  \nAny genuinely new progress on finiteness of \\(f(k)\\) for \\(k\\ge4\\) or on improving the \\(\\tfrac12\\) constant in \\(f(k)/\\log W(k)\\) would require research-level advances beyond standard textbook arguments.\n\n## Updated Registry of IDs\n- **EBB-ID-MONO-FK:** Monotonicity \\(f(k)\\le f(\\ell)\\) for \\(\\ell\\ge k\\).\n- **EBB-ID-VW-HALF:** Van der Waerden averaging bound \\(f(k)\\ge \\tfrac12 H_{W(k)-1}\\ge \\tfrac12\\log W(k)\\).\n- **EBB-ID-PSUM-CRIT:** Partial summation identity and convergence criterion linking bounds on \\(A(x)\\) to convergence of \\(\\sum_{n\\in A}1/n\\).\n- **DEAD-DIRECTION-ID-HEURVW:** Attempting to prove (ii) via unproved heuristics on growth of \\(W(k)\\)."

Key obstacles (turned into research questions)\n\n1. **Finiteness for \\(k\\ge 4\\):**  \n   - Research question: *What are the best known upper bounds on \\(r_k(N)=\\max\\{|A|\\subset[1,N]:A\\text{ is \\(k\\)-AP-free}\\}\\) for \\(k=4\\) and \\(k\\ge5\\), and are any strong enough to imply \\(\\sum_{n\\in A}1/n<\\infty\\)?*  \n   - Goal: identify a precise cited statement explaining the gap between known \\(r_k(N)\\) bounds and what is needed for harmonic-sum convergence.\n\n2. **Primary-source provenance for lower bounds on \\(f(k)\\):**  \n   - Research question: *Where exactly are the Berlekamp and Gerver bounds stated, and what do they rely on?*  \n   - Goal: cite Berlekamp 1968 and Gerver 1977 properly, and clarify that Berlekamp’s linear-in-\\(k\\) lower bound for \\(f(k)\\) comes from a 2-colouring construction on \\([1,2^k]\\) (as presented in Gerver).\n\n3. **Small-\\(k\\) records (time-sensitive):**  \n   - Research question: *What is the correct bibliographic reference for Wróblewski’s \\(f(3)\\ge 3.00849\\) result, and what exactly does Walker (2025 revision) prove for \\(f(4)\\)?*  \n   - Goal: provide accurate citations and timestamps (given today is **January 28, 2026**).\n\n---\n\n## 3. External research\n\n### 3.1 Search queries used\nI searched for (representative examples):\n- “Berlekamp 1968 construction partitions avoid long arithmetic progressions”\n- “Gerver 1977 sum of reciprocals no arithmetic progression of k terms”\n- “Wróblewski nonaveraging set large sum of reciprocals 3.00849”\n- “arXiv 2203.06045 Walker harmonic sum 4.43975 revised 2025”\n- “New bounds for Szemerédi’s theorem III polylogarithmic bound r4(N) Green Tao”\n\n### 3.2 Key findings (with sources, summary, and possible relevance)\n\n#### (A) Primary-ish sourcing for Gerver’s theorem and Berlekamp’s earlier bound\n**Source:** Gerver (1977) is clearly the right primary reference for the \\((1-o(1))k\\log k\\) lower bound, and the Gerver paper itself explains what “Berlekamp’s” earlier best bound was.\n\n- **Gerver’s main quantitative statement (as captured by AMS metadata / abstract):**  \n  For each \\(\\varepsilon>0\\), for all but finitely many \\(k\\ge 3\\), there exists a \\(k\\)-AP-free set \\(S_k\\) with\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{n\\in S_k}\\frac1n > (1-\\varepsilon)k\\log k.\n  \\]  \n  ([ams.org](https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1977-062-02/S0002-9939-1977-0439796-9/home.html))\n\n- **How Gerver phrases the earlier “best known lower bound” and what it uses:**  \n  Gerver explicitly says: when Erdős made the conjecture, the best known lower bound for his supremum \\(A_k\\) was \\(\\tfrac12 k\\log 2\\), and this was “based on the theorem that \\(2^k\\) consecutive integers can be partitioned into two sets, neither of which contains an arithmetic progression of \\(k\\) terms,” citing Berlekamp as reference [7]. ([studylib.net](https://studylib.net/doc/18211266/the-sum-of-the-reciprocals-of-a-set-of-integers-with))  \n  This is exactly the \\(\\frac{\\log 2}{2}k\\) bound attributed to Berlekamp in the background.\n\n- **Bibliographic identification of “reference [7]” in Gerver:**  \n  Gerver’s reference [7] is:\n  > E. R. Berlekamp, *A construction for partitions which avoid long arithmetic progressions*, Canad. Math. Bull. 11 (1968), 409–414. ([studylib.net](https://studylib.net/doc/18211266/the-sum-of-the-reciprocals-of-a-set-of-integers-with))\n\n**Relevance / how it helps the solver:**  \nThis directly addresses the evaluator’s request “cite Berlekamp/Gerver primary.” Even if one can’t access AMS/Cambridge PDFs cleanly through the tool, the Gerver paper’s own reference list and discussion pins down exactly the Berlekamp input and how it yields the \\(\\frac{\\log 2}{2}k\\) linear bound. ([studylib.net](https://studylib.net/doc/18211266/the-sum-of-the-reciprocals-of-a-set-of-integers-with))\n\n#### (B) Walker (arXiv:2203.06045) — latest revision and what it actually proves\n**Source:** arXiv page for Walker’s preprint. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06045))  \nURL (for solver’s notes): `https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06045`\n\n- **Revision timestamp:** arXiv shows it was “last revised 4 Sep 2025 (v2).” ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06045))  \n  Given today is Jan 28, 2026, this is plausibly still the latest public version (at least on arXiv).\n\n- **Main computational record claimed (k = 4):**  \n  Walker reports: “We identify a set with no arithmetic progression of four terms and with harmonic sum \\(4.43975\\).” ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06045))\n\n- **Kempner-set reduction (precise conditional statement):**  \n  Walker proves (Theorem 2.1 in the ar5iv-rendered version) that if \\(A\\) is \\(k\\)-free **and has convergent harmonic series**, then for any \\(\\varepsilon>0\\) there exists a \\(k\\)-free Kempner set \\(B\\) with\n  \\[\n  H(B)\\ \\ge\\ H(A)-\\varepsilon.\n  \\]\n  ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2203.06045))  \n  This clarifies the conditionality: to approximate \\(f(k)\\) from below by Kempner sets, one needs the relevant near-extremisers to have *finite* harmonic sum (which is automatic if \\(f(k)<\\infty\\), but not if \\(f(k)=\\infty\\)). ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2203.06045))\n\n- **Additional remark:** Walker’s abstract also mentions progressions of length 10 (he finds sets avoiding length 4 and 10 with improved harmonic sums). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06045))  \n  (I did not extract the precise numeric bound for \\(k=10\\) from the HTML rendering; it appears in the paper but requires careful parsing of the TeX/PDF.)\n\n**Relevance:**  \nGives a clean, timestamped “as of v2 (Sep 4, 2025)” citation for the small-\\(k\\) record \\(f(4)\\ge 4.43975\\) and a correct statement of the Kempner approximation theorem (with its convergence hypothesis). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06045))\n\n#### (C) Wróblewski 1984 — missing reference [Wr84] located\nThe background said “[Wr84] No reference found”; this is now fully identifiable.\n\n- **Journal / bibliographic data:** “A nonaveraging set of integers with a large sum of reciprocals” by J. Wróblewski appears in *Mathematics of Computation* **43** (1984), pp. 261–262. ([ams.org](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1984-43-167/home.html))  \n  JSTOR listing gives DOI `10.2307/2007410` and stable item `2007410`. ([jstor.org](https://www.jstor.org/stable/i334585))\n\n- **Content (as summarized in reliable secondary math references):** It constructs a 3-AP-free set with reciprocal sum \\(>3.00849\\). ([math.stackexchange.com](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/114504/arithmetic-progressions))\n\n**Relevance:**  \nThis plugs a purely bibliographic gap and lets the final write-up cite Wróblewski properly instead of “no reference found.” ([ams.org](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1984-43-167/home.html))\n\n#### (D) Quantitative Szemerédi bounds for \\(k=4\\) (and why they still do not imply \\(f(4)<\\infty\\))\nOne evaluator concern was “don’t state an imprecise quantitative Szemerédi bound.” I located a precise primary source for \\(r_4(N)\\).\n\n- **Green–Tao (2017, Part III of their series):**  \n  arXiv:1705.01703, *New bounds for Szemerédi’s theorem, III: A polylogarithmic bound for \\(r_4(N)\\)*. It states (in the abstract) that\n  \\[\n  r_4(N)\\ \\ll\\ N(\\log N)^{-c}\n  \\]\n  for some absolute \\(c>0\\). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01703))  \n  They also recount earlier steps: Gowers (1998) had \\(N(\\log\\log N)^{-c}\\), Green–Tao (2005) had \\(N e^{-c\\sqrt{\\log\\log N}}\\), and Part III pushes to \\(N(\\log N)^{-c}\\). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01703))\n\n- **Why this still doesn’t give convergence of \\(\\sum_{n\\in A}1/n\\):**  \n  If all one knows is \\(A(x)\\ll x/(\\log x)^{c}\\) with some small \\(c>0\\), then partial summation gives an upper bound by \\(\\int^\\infty \\frac{dx}{x(\\log x)^{c}}\\), which **diverges** unless \\(c>1\\). Therefore even the polylogarithmic \\(r_4(N)\\) bound is far from enough to show \\(f(4)<\\infty\\). (This is the conceptual reason the “finiteness for \\(k\\ge4\\)” remains open.) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01703))\n\n**Relevance:**  \nThis gives the solver a clean “named theorem + precise bound + primary citation” to justify the sentence “known quantitative Szemerédi bounds don’t imply \\(f(4)<\\infty\\).” ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01703))\n\n#### (E) Alternate equivalence references for the Erdős–Turán conjecture\nBesides the “Gerver proved equivalence” remark, there is also a standalone equivalences paper:\n\n- **Neil Hindman (1988):** *Some Equivalents of the Erdős Sum of Reciprocals Conjecture*, *European Journal of Combinatorics* 9(1) (1988), 39–47. The ScienceDirect page (open archive) states it proves equivalences between the “sum of reciprocals diverges \\(\\Rightarrow\\) arbitrarily long APs” conjecture and several other combinatorial / topological-algebraic formulations. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195669888800258))\n\n**Relevance:**  \nNot directly needed for the core inequality work, but useful if the final exposition wants to contextualize “equivalent formulations exist” with an explicit citation beyond Gerver. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195669888800258))\n\n---\n\n## 4. Impact on current solution method\n\n### Supports / strengthens the existing write-up\n- **Primary-citation upgrade is now easy:**  \n  The Gerver paper itself (via the reproduced text) explicitly records the Berlekamp-based bound and cites Berlekamp 1968 as the source of the partition of \\([1,2^k]\\) into two \\(k\\)-AP-free sets, yielding \\(f(k)\\ge \\tfrac12 k\\log 2\\). ([studylib.net](https://studylib.net/doc/18211266/the-sum-of-the-reciprocals-of-a-set-of-integers-with))  \n  This lets the final solution cite Berlekamp (1968) and Gerver (1977) as requested by the evaluator. ([studylib.net](https://studylib.net/doc/18211266/the-sum-of-the-reciprocals-of-a-set-of-integers-with))\n\n- **Small-\\(k\\) records can be properly referenced and timestamped:**  \n  Wróblewski’s missing reference is now fully identified (Math. Comp. 43 (1984), 261–262; DOI via JSTOR). ([jstor.org](https://www.jstor.org/stable/i334585))  \n  Walker’s \\(f(4)\\ge 4.43975\\) is accurately date-stamped “v2 last revised 4 Sep 2025.” ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06045))\n\n- **Kempner-set reduction conditionality clarified:**  \n  Walker’s Theorem 2.1 requires the starting \\(k\\)-free set’s harmonic series to converge. This should be reflected explicitly in any “it suffices to consider Kempner sets” sentence. ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2203.06045))\n\n- **Quantitative Szemerédi claim can be made precise (without overclaiming):**  \n  For \\(k=4\\), there *is* a polylogarithmic upper bound \\(r_4(N)\\ll N(\\log N)^{-c}\\) (Green–Tao). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01703))  \n  But it still does not reach the \\(c>1\\) threshold needed for harmonic-sum convergence, so it does not settle \\(f(4)<\\infty\\). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01703))\n\n### Does any external result undermine the current method?\nNo. The external literature supports the internal survey framing: the only missing pieces are **genuinely open** problems (Erdős–Turán for \\(k\\ge4\\); improvement over \\(1/2\\) in the \\(f(k)/\\log W(k)\\) ratio). ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/sources_bib/ErGr79))\n\n---\n\n## 5. Suggested new or refined approaches (high-level)\n\nThese are *not* “solutions,” but plausible directions consistent with the literature.\n\n### Approach A: “Quantitative Szemerédi \\(\\Rightarrow\\) harmonic convergence threshold”\n**Core idea:** Explicitly formalize the lemma: if \\(r_k(N)\\ll N/(\\log N)^{1+\\delta}\\), then \\(f(k)<\\infty\\) by partial summation.\n\n- **External hook:** Bloom–Sisask delivers exactly such an exponent \\(>1\\) for \\(k=3\\), yielding \\(f(3)<\\infty\\). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03528))  \n- **For \\(k=4\\):** Green–Tao’s \\(r_4(N)\\ll N(\\log N)^{-c}\\) is still below the “\\(1+\\delta\\)” threshold, hence cannot close the problem. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01703))  \n- **Hurdle:** improving \\(r_4(N)\\) from \\((\\log N)^{-c}\\) to \\((\\log N)^{-1-\\delta}\\) (or some other summable decay) appears beyond current methods.\n\n### Approach B: “Kempner extremisers + systematic search/optimization”\n**Core idea:** Take Walker’s reduction seriously: near-extremisers (in the finite case) can be approximated by digit-restricted (Kempner) sets, allowing computational exploration of \\(f(k)\\) and candidate extremal structures.\n\n- **External hook:** Walker’s Theorem 2.1 gives the reduction under the hypothesis that the harmonic sum converges. ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2203.06045))  \n- **Potential payoff:** better *lower bounds* and possibly structural conjectures (e.g., “best digit sets look like …”), and for small \\(k\\) it already improves \\(f(4)\\). ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2203.06045))  \n- **Hurdle:** this won’t give *upper bounds* without new theory; it is primarily constructive/lower-bound.\n\n### Approach C: “Weighted van der Waerden (harmonic-weight discrepancy)”\n**Core idea:** To beat the \\(1/2\\) baseline in \\(f(k)\\ge \\frac12 H_{W(k)-1}\\), one would need an argument that in any 2-colouring of \\([1,W(k)-1]\\) without monochromatic \\(k\\)-AP, one colour class must capture \\(>\\frac12\\) of the harmonic weight. This resembles a discrepancy/optimization question with forbidden-configuration constraints.\n\n- **External status:** Erdős Problems explicitly notes even improving \\(1/2\\) to any constant \\(>1/2\\) is open. ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/sources_bib/ErGr79))  \n- **Hurdle:** no known general structural theorem about such colourings seems to force harmonic imbalance.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Difficulty assessment and next-step recommendation\n\n### Difficulty assessment\n- **Part (i):** “Estimate \\(f(k)\\)” is currently only answerable in the *survey sense* (best-known lower bounds + finiteness known for \\(k=3\\) + open for \\(k\\ge4\\)). This looks **borderline research-level** for \\(k\\ge4\\) because it is essentially the Erdős–Turán conjecture. ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/sources_bib/ErGr79))  \n- **Part (ii):** Very likely **beyond current methods / open**, since even showing \\(\\frac{f(k)}{\\log W(k)}>\\frac12\\) uniformly is explicitly listed as open. ([erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/sources_bib/ErGr79))\n\n### Recommended next internal step\nFocus on **expository consolidation with upgraded citations**, not on forcing a nonexistent “complete proof”:\n\n1. Replace the Berlekamp/Gerver citations with:\n   - Gerver (1977) as the primary source for the \\((1-\\varepsilon)k\\log k\\) construction and as the place that explicitly explains the Berlekamp-based \\(\\tfrac12 k\\log 2\\) bound and cites Berlekamp 1968. ([studylib.net](https://studylib.net/doc/18211266/the-sum-of-the-reciprocals-of-a-set-of-integers-with))  \n   - Berlekamp (1968) as the source of the partition construction (cite via bibliographic metadata if needed). ([resolve.cambridge.org](https://resolve.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-mathematical-bulletin/article/construction-for-partitions-which-avoid-long-arithmetic-progressions/F8101060236B2BDF91A28BF30CC2162E))\n\n2. Add the missing bibliographic reference for Wróblewski (1984), and timestamp “record as of …”. ([jstor.org](https://www.jstor.org/stable/i334585))\n\n3. If you want one accurate sentence about quantitative Szemerédi for \\(k=4\\), cite Green–Tao (2017) and explicitly note why it still doesn’t imply convergence of \\(\\sum_{n\\in A}1/n\\). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01703))\n\nThis should yield an exam-grade “best known + open” final response, with no reliance on weak secondary sources for the key mathematical claims."

This meets the TEDIOUS REMAINDER plateau criterion, so further solver↔evaluator loops are not useful. However, several claims (notably the best-known numerical lower bounds for f(3) and f(4) and the exact versions/dates) are time-sensitive as of Jan 28, 2026 and should be verified before finalizing.
